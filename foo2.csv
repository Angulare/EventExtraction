U.S. equity futures suggest a mixed open on Wall Street ahead of Redbook retail sales data at 8:55 am Eastern time and June house price data at 9:00 am Eastern time.  U.S. equity futures traded mixed Tuesday, with softer bond yields giving a modest boost to record-high tech stocks, as investors look set to hit pause on the mini rally triggered by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's patience on tapering.  Growth concerns resurfaced Tuesday following last night's record closes for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, as China reported barely-advancing economic activity data for the month of August and Eurozone inflation was estimated at the highest level in a decade, both thanks in part to the lingering affects of the current wave of coronavirus infections.  In the U.S., stubbornly-high coronavirus infection rates, accelerated by the Delta variant, are muting consumer confidence and holding back retail spending. Major American companies are also considering changes to the business practices in the coming weeks, with McDonald's  (MCD) - Get McDonald's Corporation (MCD) Report reportedly mulling the shut-down on indoor dining and airlines reducing flight capacity in the wake of tepid demand.

Tech stocks look set to open only modestly higher despite the ongoing pullback in Treasury bond yields, which pegged benchmark 10-year notes at 1.277%, with futures suggesting a 5 point gain for the Nasdaq Composite index.  Zoom Video Communications  (ZM) - Get Zoom Video Communications (ZM) Report shares were the notable pre-market mover Tuesday, slumping 11.5% to wipe out all of the stock's gains for the year, after the online conferencing group forecast tepid revenue growth as smaller businesses and schools return to in-person activities.  Robinhood  (HOOD) - Get Robinhood Report shares were also in the red, falling 1.9% to extend yesterday's decline triggered by a Barron's interview with SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, who said a full ban on the controversial 'payment for order flow' practice was ""on the table"".  In overseas markets, European stocks peeled back from yesterday's near-record highs following the faster-than-expected inflation data and the EU's decision to remove the U.S from its safe-travel list.  International Consolidated Airlines, the parent company of British Airways, slumped 2.8% in London trading while Germay's flagship carrier Lufthansa fell 1.3% in Frankfurt.

End Further Info End Preamble Start Supplemental Information  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  On June 15, 1984, OMB delegated to the Board authority under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) to approve and assign OMB control numbers to collections of information conducted or sponsored by the Board. Board-approved collections of information are incorporated into the official OMB inventory of currently approved collections of information. The OMB inventory, as well as copies of the PRA Submission, supporting statements, and approved collection of information instrument(s) are available at https://www.reginfo.gov/​public/​do/​PRAMain. These documents are also available on the Federal Reserve Board's public website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/​apps/​reportforms/​review.aspx or may be requested from the agency clearance officer, whose name appears above.  Final Approval Under OMB Delegated Authority of the Extension for Three Years, With Revision, of the Following Information Collection  Report title: Recordkeeping and Disclosure Requirements Associated with Truth in Lending (Regulation Z).[1]  Agency form number: FR Z.  OMB control number: 7100-0199.  Effective Date: The revisions are effective immediately.  Frequency: Annually, on occasion.  Respondents: The FR Z panel comprises state member banks with assets of $10 billion or less that are not affiliated with an insured depository institution with assets over $10 billion (irrespective of the consolidated assets of any holding company); non-depository affiliates of such state member banks; and non-depository affiliates of bank holding companies that are not affiliated with an insured depository institution with assets over $10 billion.[2]  However, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) also have administrative enforcement authority over nondepository institutions for Regulation Z.[3]  Accordingly, the Bureau allocates to itself half of the estimated burden to non-depository institutions, with the other half allocated to the FTC.[4]  The Board's ability to reduce regulatory burden for small entities under Regulation Z is limited because the Dodd-Frank Act transferred rule writing authority for Board-supervised institutions under Regulation Z to the Bureau. Nonetheless, the Board has taken steps to minimize burden on small entities through tailored supervision, including through a risk-focused consumer compliance supervision program and an examination frequency policy that provides for lengthened time between examinations for institutions with a lower risk profile.  The Board allocates to itself all estimated burden to state member banks with assets of $10 billion or less that are not affiliated with an insured depository institution with assets over $10 billion.

General description of report: The Truth in Lending Act (TILA) and Regulation Z promote the informed use of credit to consumers for personal, family, or household purposes by requiring disclosures about its terms and costs, as well as ensure that consumers are provided with timely information on the nature and costs of the residential real estate settlement process.  Legal authorization and confidentiality: The disclosure, recordkeeping, and other requirements of Regulation Z are authorized by TILA, which directs the Bureau and, for certain lenders, the Board to issue regulations implementing the statute. The obligation to respond is mandatory.  The disclosures, records, policies and procedures required by Regulation Z are not required to be submitted to the Board. To the extent such information is obtained by the Board through the examination process, they may be kept confidential under exemption 8 of the Freedom of Information Act, which protects information contained in or related to an examination of a financial institution.[5]  Current actions: On April 16, 2021, the Board published an initial notice in the Federal Register (86 FR 20156) requesting public comment for 60 days on the extension, with revision, of the FR Z. The Board proposed to revise FR Z to: (1) Add burden related to disclosure requirements in rules issued by the Bureau since the Board's last Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) submission, as well as for one information collection for which the Bureau estimates burden but the Board previously did not; (2) break out and clarify burden estimates that were previously consolidated; and (3) eliminate burden associated with certain requirements because the Bureau accounts for burden for the entire industry, or because the burden is now deemed de minimis or a part of an institution's usual and customary business practices. The comment period for this notice expired on June 15, 2021. The Board did not receive any comments. The revisions will be implemented as proposed.  Start Signature  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, August 26, 2021.  Michele Taylor Fennell,  Deputy Associate Secretary of the Board.  1. The Truth in Lending Act (TILA) is codified at 15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.

Proposal Under OMB Delegated Authority To Extend for Three Years, With Revision, the Following Information Collection  Report title: Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements Associated with Regulation W.  Agency form number: FR W.  OMB control number: 7100-0304.  Frequency: Event generated.  Respondents: Insured depository institutions and uninsured member banks.  Estimated number of respondents: 1.  Estimated average hours per response: Section 223.15(b)(4), 2; Section 223.31(d)(4), 6; Section 223.41(d)(2), 6; Section 223.43(b), 10; Section 223.42(f), 2; Section 223.42(g)(3), 2.  Estimated annual burden hours: 28.  General description of report: The FR W information collection comprises the reporting requirements of Regulation W that are found in sections 223.15(b)(4), 223.31(d)(4), 223.41(d)(2), and 223.43(b). This information is used to demonstrate compliance with sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act (FRA) and to request certain exemptions from the Board. Sections 23A and 23B of the FRA are designed to protect a depository institution from exposure arising from certain transactions with affiliates. They also limit the ability of an insured depository institution to transfer the subsidy arising from access to the federal safety net to such affiliates. Regulation W implements sections 23A and 23B by defining terms used in the statute, explaining the statute's requirements, and exempting certain transactions. The regulation includes provisions requiring the reporting of information to the Board under certain circumstances, including a provision permitting a bank to request from the Board a discretionary exemption from the requirements of section 23A as long as the Board finds the exemption to be in the public interest and consistent with the purposes of section 23A.  Proposed revisions: The Board proposes to revise the FR W information collection to account for two recordkeeping provisions in section 223.42 of Regulation W that have not been previously cleared by the Board under the PRA. The Board is not proposing to create any forms associated with the FR W to address these provisions.  Certain transactions with affiliates are exempt from the quantitative limits, collateral requirements, and low-quality asset prohibition of Regulation W. Section 12 CFR 223.42(f) exempts from those provisions certain purchases by a Start Printed Page 49033depository institution of securities from a securities affiliate if, among other requirements, the depository institution maintains, for a period of two years, records and supporting information that are sufficient to enable the appropriate Federal banking agency to ensure the depository institution's compliance with the terms of the exemption.[1]  Separately, section 12 CFR 223.42(g)(3) exempts purchases by a depository institution of municipal securities from a securities affiliate if, among other requirements, the price of the security is quoted routinely on an unaffiliated electronic service that provides indicative data from real-time financial networks and the price paid for the security can be verified by reference to the written summary provided by the syndicate manager to syndicate members that discloses the aggregate par values and prices of all bonds sold from the syndicate account, so long as the depository institution obtains a copy of the summary from its securities affiliate and retains the summary for three years.[2]  Legal authorization and confidentiality: Sections 23A and 23B of the FRA authorize the Board to issue these requirements. Compliance with the FR W requirements is required to obtain a benefit.  Information provided on the Loan Participation Renewal notice (Section 223.15(b)(4)) may be considered confidential under exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”) as confidential commercial or financial information that is both customarily and actually treated as private. Information provided on the Acquisition notice (Section 223.31(d)(4)), the Internal Corporate Reorganization Transaction notice (Section 223.41(d)(2)), and the Section 23A Additional Information request (Section 223.43(b)) generally is not considered confidential, but respondents may request confidential treatment under exemption 4 of the FOIA if the information is confidential commercial or financial information that is both customarily and actually treated as private. Information collected under the FR W may also be considered confidential under FOIA exemption 8 if it is obtained as part of an examination or supervision of a financial institution.

Proposal Under OMB Delegated Authority To Extend for Three Years, Without Revision, the Following Information Collection  Report title: Recordkeeping Provisions Associated with the Guidance on Sound Incentive Compensation Policies.  Agency form number: FR 4027.  OMB control number: 7100-0327.  Frequency: As needed.  Respondents: U.S. bank holding companies, savings and loan holding companies, state member banks, Edge Act and agreement corporations, and the U.S. operations of foreign banks with a branch, agency, or commercial lending company subsidiary in the United States (collectively, banking organizations).  Estimated number of respondents: One-time implementation, large institutions: 1; one-time implementation, small institutions: 1; ongoing maintenance: 5,259.  Estimated average hours per response: One-time implementation, large institutions: 480; one-time implementation, small institutions: 80; ongoing maintenance: 40.  Estimated annual burden hours: One-time implementation, large institutions: 480; one-time implementation, small institutions: 80; ongoing maintenance: 210,360.  General description of report: The Guidance on Sound Incentive Compensation Policies (the Guidance) is an interagency publication promulgated by the Board, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) that is intended to assist banking organizations in designing and implementing incentive compensation arrangements that do not encourage imprudent risk-taking and that are consistent with the safety and soundness of the organization. The Guidance contains voluntary recordkeeping activities.  The Guidance is based on three key principles. These principles provide that incentive compensation arrangements at a banking organization should:  1. Provide employees incentives that appropriately balance risk and reward;  2. Be compatible with effective controls and risk-management; and  3. Be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization's board of directors.  The recordkeeping provisions of the Guidance are contained within principles 2 and 3.  Principle 2—Compatibility With Effective Controls and Risk Management  Pursuant to Principle 2 of the Guidance, a banking organization's risk-management processes and internal controls should reinforce and support the development and maintenance of balanced incentive compensation arrangements. Principle 2 states that banking organizations should create and maintain sufficient documentation to permit an audit of the organization's processes for establishing, modifying, and monitoring incentive compensation arrangements.  Additionally, global systemically important bank holding companies and banking organizations subject to Category II-IV enhanced prudential standards under Regulation YY and foreign banking organizations required to form an intermediate holding company under Regulation YY should maintain policies and procedures that (1) identify and describe the role(s) of the personnel, business units, and control units authorized to be involved in the design, implementation, and monitoring of incentive compensation arrangements, (2) identify the source of significant risk-related inputs into these processes and establish appropriate controls governing the development and approval of these inputs to help ensure their integrity, and (3) identify the individual(s) and control unit(s) whose approval is necessary for the establishment of new incentive compensation arrangements or modification of existing arrangements.  Principle 3—Strong Corporate Governance  Pursuant to Principle 3 of the Guidance, banking organizations should have strong and effective corporate governance to help ensure sound compensation practices. Principle 3 states that a banking organization's board of directors should approve and document any material exceptions or adjustments to the organization's incentive compensation arrangements established for senior executives.  Legal authorization and confidentiality: The recordkeeping provisions of the Guidance are authorized pursuant to the Board's examination and reporting authorities, located in sections 9, 11(a), 25, and 25A of the Federal Reserve Act, section 5 of the Bank Holding Company Act, section 10(b) of the Home Owners' Loan Act, and section 7(c) of the International Banking Act, and by section 39 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, which authorizes the Board to prescribe compensation standards.  Because the recordkeeping provisions are contained within guidance, which is nonbinding, they are voluntary. There are no reporting forms associated with this information collection.  Because the incentive compensation records would be maintained at each banking organization, the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) would only be implicated if the Board obtained such records as part of the examination or supervision of a banking organization. In the event the records are obtained by the Board as part of an examination or supervision of a banking organization, this information may be considered confidential pursuant to exemption 8 of the FOIA, which protects information contained in “examination, operating, or condition reports” obtained in the bank supervisory process. In addition, the information may also constitute nonpublic commercial or financial information, which is both customarily and actually treated as private by the respondent, and thus may be kept confidential by the Board pursuant to exemption 4 of the FOIA.  Consultation outside the agency: The Board has consulted with the FDIC and OCC and confirmed that there will be no revisions to the guidance.

Final Approval Under OMB Delegated Authority of the Extension for Three Years, With Revision, of the Following Information Collection  Report title: Recordkeeping and Disclosure Requirements Associated with Truth in Lending (Regulation Z).[1]  Agency form number: FR Z.  OMB control number: 7100-0199.  Effective Date: The revisions are effective immediately.  Frequency: Annually, on occasion.  Respondents: The FR Z panel comprises state member banks with assets of $10 billion or less that are not affiliated with an insured depository institution with assets over $10 billion (irrespective of the consolidated assets of any holding company); non-depository affiliates of such state member banks; and non-depository affiliates of bank holding companies that are not affiliated with an insured depository institution with assets over $10 billion.[2]  However, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) also have administrative enforcement authority over nondepository institutions for Regulation Z.[3]  Accordingly, the Bureau allocates to itself half of the estimated burden to non-depository institutions, with the other half allocated to the FTC.[4]  The Board's ability to reduce regulatory burden for small entities under Regulation Z is limited because the Dodd-Frank Act transferred rule writing authority for Board-supervised institutions under Regulation Z to the Bureau. Nonetheless, the Board has taken steps to minimize burden on small entities through tailored supervision, including through a risk-focused consumer compliance supervision program and an examination frequency policy that provides for lengthened time between examinations for institutions with a lower risk profile.  The Board allocates to itself all estimated burden to state member banks with assets of $10 billion or less that are not affiliated with an insured depository institution with assets over $10 billion.

General description of report: The Truth in Lending Act (TILA) and Regulation Z promote the informed use of credit to consumers for personal, family, or household purposes by requiring disclosures about its terms and costs, as well as ensure that consumers are provided with timely information on the nature and costs of the residential real estate settlement process.  Legal authorization and confidentiality: The disclosure, recordkeeping, and other requirements of Regulation Z are authorized by TILA, which directs the Bureau and, for certain lenders, the Board to issue regulations implementing the statute. The obligation to respond is mandatory.  The disclosures, records, policies and procedures required by Regulation Z are not required to be submitted to the Board. To the extent such information is obtained by the Board through the examination process, they may be kept confidential under exemption 8 of the Freedom of Information Act, which protects information contained in or related to an examination of a financial institution.[5]  Current actions: On April 16, 2021, the Board published an initial notice in the Federal Register (86 FR 20156) requesting public comment for 60 days on the extension, with revision, of the FR Z. The Board proposed to revise FR Z to: (1) Add burden related to disclosure requirements in rules issued by the Bureau since the Board's last Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) submission, as well as for one information collection for which the Bureau estimates burden but the Board previously did not; (2) break out and clarify burden estimates that were previously consolidated; and (3) eliminate burden associated with certain requirements because the Bureau accounts for burden for the entire industry, or because the burden is now deemed de minimis or a part of an institution's usual and customary business practices. The comment period for this notice expired on June 15, 2021. The Board did not receive any comments. The revisions will be implemented as proposed.

Proposal Under OMB Delegated Authority To Extend for Three Years, With Revision, the Following Information Collection  Report title: Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements Associated with Regulation W.  Agency form number: FR W.  OMB control number: 7100-0304.  Frequency: Event generated.  Respondents: Insured depository institutions and uninsured member banks.  Estimated number of respondents: 1.  Estimated average hours per response: Section 223.15(b)(4), 2; Section 223.31(d)(4), 6; Section 223.41(d)(2), 6; Section 223.43(b), 10; Section 223.42(f), 2; Section 223.42(g)(3), 2.  Estimated annual burden hours: 28.  General description of report: The FR W information collection comprises the reporting requirements of Regulation W that are found in sections 223.15(b)(4), 223.31(d)(4), 223.41(d)(2), and 223.43(b). This information is used to demonstrate compliance with sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act (FRA) and to request certain exemptions from the Board. Sections 23A and 23B of the FRA are designed to protect a depository institution from exposure arising from certain transactions with affiliates. They also limit the ability of an insured depository institution to transfer the subsidy arising from access to the federal safety net to such affiliates. Regulation W implements sections 23A and 23B by defining terms used in the statute, explaining the statute's requirements, and exempting certain transactions. The regulation includes provisions requiring the reporting of information to the Board under certain circumstances, including a provision permitting a bank to request from the Board a discretionary exemption from the requirements of section 23A as long as the Board finds the exemption to be in the public interest and consistent with the purposes of section 23A.  Proposed revisions: The Board proposes to revise the FR W information collection to account for two recordkeeping provisions in section 223.42 of Regulation W that have not been previously cleared by the Board under the PRA. The Board is not proposing to create any forms associated with the FR W to address these provisions.  Certain transactions with affiliates are exempt from the quantitative limits, collateral requirements, and low-quality asset prohibition of Regulation W. Section 12 CFR 223.42(f) exempts from those provisions certain purchases by a Start Printed Page 49033depository institution of securities from a securities affiliate if, among other requirements, the depository institution maintains, for a period of two years, records and supporting information that are sufficient to enable the appropriate Federal banking agency to ensure the depository institution's compliance with the terms of the exemption.[1]  Separately, section 12 CFR 223.42(g)(3) exempts purchases by a depository institution of municipal securities from a securities affiliate if, among other requirements, the price of the security is quoted routinely on an unaffiliated electronic service that provides indicative data from real-time financial networks and the price paid for the security can be verified by reference to the written summary provided by the syndicate manager to syndicate members that discloses the aggregate par values and prices of all bonds sold from the syndicate account, so long as the depository institution obtains a copy of the summary from its securities affiliate and retains the summary for three years.[2]  Legal authorization and confidentiality: Sections 23A and 23B of the FRA authorize the Board to issue these requirements. Compliance with the FR W requirements is required to obtain a benefit.  Information provided on the Loan Participation Renewal notice (Section 223.15(b)(4)) may be considered confidential under exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”) as confidential commercial or financial information that is both customarily and actually treated as private. Information provided on the Acquisition notice (Section 223.31(d)(4)), the Internal Corporate Reorganization Transaction notice (Section 223.41(d)(2)), and the Section 23A Additional Information request (Section 223.43(b)) generally is not considered confidential, but respondents may request confidential treatment under exemption 4 of the FOIA if the information is confidential commercial or financial information that is both customarily and actually treated as private. Information collected under the FR W may also be considered confidential under FOIA exemption 8 if it is obtained as part of an examination or supervision of a financial institution.

Proposal Under OMB Delegated Authority To Extend for Three Years, Without Revision, the Following Information Collection  Report title: Recordkeeping Provisions Associated with the Guidance on Sound Incentive Compensation Policies.  Agency form number: FR 4027.  OMB control number: 7100-0327.  Frequency: As needed.  Respondents: U.S. bank holding companies, savings and loan holding companies, state member banks, Edge Act and agreement corporations, and the U.S. operations of foreign banks with a branch, agency, or commercial lending company subsidiary in the United States (collectively, banking organizations).  Estimated number of respondents: One-time implementation, large institutions: 1; one-time implementation, small institutions: 1; ongoing maintenance: 5,259.  Estimated average hours per response: One-time implementation, large institutions: 480; one-time implementation, small institutions: 80; ongoing maintenance: 40.  Estimated annual burden hours: One-time implementation, large institutions: 480; one-time implementation, small institutions: 80; ongoing maintenance: 210,360.  General description of report: The Guidance on Sound Incentive Compensation Policies (the Guidance) is an interagency publication promulgated by the Board, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) that is intended to assist banking organizations in designing and implementing incentive compensation arrangements that do not encourage imprudent risk-taking and that are consistent with the safety and soundness of the organization. The Guidance contains voluntary recordkeeping activities.  The Guidance is based on three key principles. These principles provide that incentive compensation arrangements at a banking organization should:  1. Provide employees incentives that appropriately balance risk and reward;  2. Be compatible with effective controls and risk-management; and  3. Be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization's board of directors.  The recordkeeping provisions of the Guidance are contained within principles 2 and 3.  Principle 2—Compatibility With Effective Controls and Risk Management  Pursuant to Principle 2 of the Guidance, a banking organization's risk-management processes and internal controls should reinforce and support the development and maintenance of balanced incentive compensation arrangements. Principle 2 states that banking organizations should create and maintain sufficient documentation to permit an audit of the organization's processes for establishing, modifying, and monitoring incentive compensation arrangements.  Additionally, global systemically important bank holding companies and banking organizations subject to Category II-IV enhanced prudential standards under Regulation YY and foreign banking organizations required to form an intermediate holding company under Regulation YY should maintain policies and procedures that (1) identify and describe the role(s) of the personnel, business units, and control units authorized to be involved in the design, implementation, and monitoring of incentive compensation arrangements, (2) identify the source of significant risk-related inputs into these processes and establish appropriate controls governing the development and approval of these inputs to help ensure their integrity, and (3) identify the individual(s) and control unit(s) whose approval is necessary for the establishment of new incentive compensation arrangements or modification of existing arrangements.  Principle 3—Strong Corporate Governance  Pursuant to Principle 3 of the Guidance, banking organizations should have strong and effective corporate governance to help ensure sound compensation practices. Principle 3 states that a banking organization's board of directors should approve and document any material exceptions or adjustments to the organization's incentive compensation arrangements established for senior executives.  Legal authorization and confidentiality: The recordkeeping provisions of the Guidance are authorized pursuant to the Board's examination and reporting authorities, located in sections 9, 11(a), 25, and 25A of the Federal Reserve Act, section 5 of the Bank Holding Company Act, section 10(b) of the Home Owners' Loan Act, and section 7(c) of the International Banking Act, and by section 39 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, which authorizes the Board to prescribe compensation standards.  Because the recordkeeping provisions are contained within guidance, which is nonbinding, they are voluntary. There are no reporting forms associated with this information collection.  Because the incentive compensation records would be maintained at each banking organization, the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) would only be implicated if the Board obtained such records as part of the examination or supervision of a banking organization. In the event the records are obtained by the Board as part of an examination or supervision of a banking organization, this information may be considered confidential pursuant to exemption 8 of the FOIA, which protects information contained in “examination, operating, or condition reports” obtained in the bank supervisory process. In addition, the information may also constitute nonpublic commercial or financial information, which is both customarily and actually treated as private by the respondent, and thus may be kept confidential by the Board pursuant to exemption 4 of the FOIA.  Consultation outside the agency: The Board has consulted with the FDIC and OCC and confirmed that there will be no revisions to the guidance.

Fair Labor Standards Act,Wage Increases Proposed for Federal Contractors,Paint Square | News,Paint Square,"Wage Increases Proposed for Federal Contractors  Earlier this summer, the U.S. Department of Labor issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to increase the minimum wage for federal contractors.  The proposal would require federal contractors to pay workers at least $15 an hour by 2022 and looks to enforce another recent executive order.  Executive Order Details  Back in April, the White House reported that President Joe Biden had signed Executive Order 14026, “Increasing the Minimum Wage for Federal Contractors,” which aims to promote “economy and efficiency in federal procurement by increasing the hourly minimum wage paid by the parties that contract with the federal government to $15 for those workers working on or in connection with a federal government contract.”  In addition to raising the minimum wage for federal contract workers by $4.05 an hour (the current rate is $10.95), the rule also looks to eliminate subminimum wage rates for federal contract workers with disabilities and workers who customarily receive tips.  Although the prior rule applied only to new and renewed federal contracts, the new proposal would apply the $15 minimum wage to existing contracts when agencies opt to purchase additional supplies or services. As specified in the proposed rule, the DOL defines applicable contracts as “all contracts and any subcontracts of any tier thereunder, whether negotiated or advertised, including any procurement actions, lease agreements, cooperative agreements, provider agreements, intergovernmental service agreements, service agreements, licenses, permits or any other type of agreement, regardless of nomenclature, type or particular form, and whether entered into verbally or in writing.”  The DOL further specifies that eligible workers include apprentices.  Other updated procedures and enforcements in the EO 14026 include:  Increasing the minimum wage for workers performing work on covered federal contracts to $15 an hour starting on January 30, 2022, however, beginning January 1, 2023, and annually thereafter, the amount would be determined by the Secretary of Labor;  Continuing to index the minimum wage for federal contract workers to keep pace with inflation;  Eliminating the tipped minimum wage for federal contract workers by 2024;  Establishing a $15 minimum wage for workers with disabilities who perform work on covered contracts; and  Restoring minimum-wage protections to outfitters and guides who operate on federal lands.  “Our proposed regulations to implement President Biden's executive order will ensure taxpayer dollars uphold the dignity of work and provide a living wage to workers on federal contracts, including cleaning, maintenance, nursing and food service workers whose efforts are critical to the nation's pandemic recovery,” said Wage and Hour Division Acting Administrator Jessica Looman.  The executive order directs the Secretary to issue regulations by Nov. 24, consistent with applicable law, to implement the order’s requirements. The proposed rule was published in the Federal Register on July 22. The comment period for the proposed rulemaking reportedly closed last week on Aug. 27.  Other Related DOL Reports  At the beginning of the year the DOL announced a final rule meant to clarify the status of independent contractors under the Fair Labor Standards Act.  The DOL’s Final Rule includes the following clarifications:  Reaffirms an “economic reality” test to determine whether an individual is in business for themselves (independent contractor) or is economically dependent on a potential employer for work (FLSA employee).  Identifies and explains two “core factors” that are most probative to the question of whether a worker is economically dependent on someone else’s business or is in business for themselves:  The nature and degree of control over the work.  The worker’s opportunity for profit or loss based on initiative and/or investment.  Identifies three other factors that may serve as additional guideposts in the analysis, particularly when the two core factors do not point to the same classification. The factors are the amount of skill required for the work, the degree of permanence of the working relationship between the worker and the potential employer, and whether the work is part of an integrated unit of production. The actual practice of the worker and the potential employer is more relevant than what may be contractually or theoretically possible.  Provides six fact-specific examples applying the factors.  The rule took effect on March 8.  In June, the Labor Secretary Marty Walsh revealed that the Department of Labor would again be reviewing the current overtime threshold under the Fair Labor Standards Act. Walsh reportedly noted that the current threshold, which is just under $36,000 and was finalized in 2019, is “definitely” too low.  Reportedly, the department will include in its review whether regular, automatic updates to the threshold are necessary, which Walsh supports.  According to a DOL official, no changes are slated to be made to the FLSA’s duties test and no time frame has been established for any automatic updates to the overtime eligibility threshold beyond what is already included in the final rule."

Fair Debt Collection Practices Act,SB-531,California Legislative Information | Today's Schedule | Sen. Check-in Session Bills,California Legislative Information,"SB-531  Existing law, the Rosenthal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, regulates the collection of a consumer debt, as defined, by a debt collector. Existing law defines “debt collector” to mean a person who, in the ordinary course of business engages in debt collection, including any person who composes and sells, or offers to compose and sell, forms, letters, and other collection media used or intended to be used for debt collection.  Existing law, the Debt Collection Licensing Act, prohibits, beginning January 1, 2022, a person from engaging in the business of debt collection in this state without first obtaining a license from the Commissioner of Financial Protection and Innovation. Existing law prohibits a debt buyer from making a written statement to a debtor in an attempt to collect a consumer debt unless the debt buyer possesses specified information, including the date of default or the date of the last payment, and requires the debt buyer to include specified information in the written statement to the debtor. Existing law defines “debt buyer” to mean a person or entity that is regularly engaged in the business of purchasing charged-off consumer debt for collection purposes, whether it collects the debt itself, hires a third party for collection, or hires an attorney-at-law for collection litigation.  This bill would require, after January 1, 2022, require a debt collector to which a delinquent debt, as defined, defined and specified, has been assigned for collection to provide to the debtor, upon the debtor’s request, a written statement that includes certain information, including the date the debt became delinquent or the date of the last payment, within 30 calendar days of receipt of a debtor’s written request for information regarding the debt or proof of the debt, as specified. The bill would require a debt collector to which delinquent debt has been assigned to include in its first written communication with the debtor a specified notice, and would require a debt collector to provide a debtor an active postal address to which a debtor may send a request for the information. The bill would provide that a debt buyer who complies with the written statement requirements under the Debt Collection Licensing Act is deemed to comply with this new requirement on a debt collector, to which a delinquent debt has been assigned, to provide a written statement to the debtor upon the debtor’s request. The bill would prohibit a debt collector to which a delinquent debt has been assigned from making a written statement to a debtor in an attempt to collect a delinquent consumer debt, except if the debt collector has access to specified information, as provided. The bill would provide that these provisions become operative on July 1, 2022.  1788.14.5.  (a) A debt collector to which a delinquent debt has been assigned for collection shall provide to the debtor, upon the debtor’s written request, a statement that includes all of the following information pursuant to subdivision (c):  (1) That the debt collector has authority to assert the rights of the creditor to collect the debt.  (2) (A) The debt balance and an explanation of the amount, nature, and reason for all interest and fees, if any, imposed by the creditor or any subsequent entities to which the debt was assigned.  (B) The explanation required by subparagraph (A) shall identify separately the balance, the total of any interest, and the total of any fees.  (3) The date the debt became delinquent or the date of the last payment.  (4) The name and an address of the creditor and the creditor’s account number associated with the debt. The creditor’s name and address shall be in sufficient form so as to reasonably identify the creditor.  (5) The name and last known address of the debtor as they appeared in the creditor’s records before the assignment of the debt to the debt collector.  (6) The names and addresses of all persons or entities other than the debt collector to which the debt was assigned. The names and addresses shall be in sufficient form so as to reasonably identify each assignee.  (7) The California license number of the debt collector.  (b) A debt collector to which delinquent debt has been assigned shall not make a written statement to a debtor in an attempt to collect a delinquent debt unless the debt collector has access to a copy of a contract or other document evidencing the debtor’s agreement to the debt, except in the following circumstances:  (1) If the claim is based on debt for which no signed contract or agreement exists, the debt collector shall have access to a copy of a document provided to the debtor while the account was active, demonstrating that the debt was incurred by the debtor.  (2) For a revolving credit account, the most recent monthly statement recording a purchase transaction, last payment, or balance transfer shall be deemed sufficient to satisfy the requirements of this subparagraph.  (c) (1) A debt collector to which delinquent debt has been assigned shall provide the information or documents identified in subdivisions (a) and (b) to the debtor without charge within 30 calendar days of receipt of a debtor’s written request for information regarding the debt or proof of the debt.  (2) If the debt collector cannot provide the information or documents within 30 calendar days, the debt collector shall cease all collection of the debt until the debt collector provides the debtor the information or documents described in subdivisions (a) and (b).  (d) (1) A debt collector shall provide a debtor with whom it has contact an active postal address to which a debtor may send a request for the information described in this section.  (2) A debt collector may also provide an active email address to which these requests can be sent and through which information and documents can be delivered if the parties agree.

European Securities Markets Authority,Thailand Halal Industry Poised for Strong Growth,International Quran News Agency | All Stories,International Quran News Agency,"Thailand Halal Industry Poised for Strong Growth  The Federation of Thai Industries had earlier revealed that it expects Thailand’s revenue from halal exports to rise 5 per cent in 2021.  Thailand is one of the largest halal product exporters in the world and produces everything from halal food and beverages to cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, consumer goods, meat, fertilizer, animal feed and more.  Panot Punyahotra Director of Thai Trade Centre, Dubai said: “With a long history in the agri-food, food processing and non-food industries as well as expertise in international halal certification, Thailand possesses huge potential to have a greater share of the global halal market. Through the backing of the Thai government, Thai food manufacturers and exporters have strong institutional support in place to encourage capacity building in critical areas such as international food hygiene and Halal standards, innovation, marketing, and assistance for small and medium-sized companies. I am certain that Thailand will become the leading hub for halal products and capture a bigger slice of the global halal market.”  According to the State of the Global Islamic Economy Report 2020, the global halal industry is estimated to be worth around USD2.3 trillion and growing at an estimated annual rate of 20%.  For halal F&B, Thailand is the world’s fifth largest producer with a 5.6% share of the global halal food market valued at US$5 billion a year, as per the Board of Investment of Thailand. Thailand also ranks first for halal export among ASEAN countries. Halal food currently accounts for 20% of Thailand’s global food exports with more than 60% of halal exports going to Indonesia, Malaysia, and Brunei.  Thailand has developed a number of key strategies to further strengthen the country's halal industry, particularly in terms of meeting global standards, promoting entrepreneur competitiveness, increasing capability in halal certification and standard formulation, and upgrading research and development. The establishment of the Central Islamic Council of Thailand (CICOT) and the Halal Science Centre Chulalongkorn University illustrates the government's determination to make Thailand a recognized halal center of excellence in science and testing.  The Central Islamic Council of Thailand (CICOT), which is the authorized halal certification body in Thailand, has also been accredited by the Emirates Authority for Standardization and Metrology (ESMA) of UAE. All halal products exported to the UAE are inspected and certified by CICOT to ensure it meets ESMA’s standard and regulations.  Meanwhile, the Halal Science Centre Chulalongkorn University, the first of its kind center in the world, was established to support halal inspection and certification processes based on valid laboratory analysis. The Centre works on the use of science and technology in food analysis in order to preserve halal standards."

Agency form number:   FR 4027.   OMB control number:   7100–0327.   Frequency:   As needed.   Respondents:   U.S. bank holding   companies, savings and loan holding   companies, state member banks, Edge   Act and agreement corporations, and the   U.S. operations of foreign banks with a   branch, agency, or commercial lending   company subsidiary in the United States   (collectively, banking organizations).   Estimated number of respondents:   One-time implementation, large   institutions: 1; one-time   implementation, small institutions: 1;   ongoing maintenance: 5,259.   Estimated average hours per response:   One-time implementation, large   institutions: 480; one-time   implementation, small institutions: 80;   ongoing maintenance: 40.   Estimated annual burden hours:   One-   time implementation, large institutions:   480; one-time implementation, small   institutions: 80; ongoing maintenance:   210,360.   General description of report:   The   Guidance on Sound Incentive   Compensation Policies (the Guidance) is   an interagency publication promulgated   by the Board, the Office of the   Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and   the Federal Deposit Insurance   Corporation (FDIC) that is intended to   assist banking organizations in   designing and implementing incentive   compensation arrangements that do not   encourage imprudent risk-taking and   that are consistent with the safety and   soundness of the organization. The   Guidance contains voluntary   recordkeeping activities.   The Guidance is based on three key   principles. These principles provide   that incentive compensation   arrangements at a banking organization   should:   1. Provide employees incentives that   appropriately balance risk and reward;   2. Be compatible with effective   controls and risk-management; and   3. Be supported by strong corporate   governance, including active and   effective oversight by the organization’s   board of directors.   The recordkeeping provisions of the   Guidance are contained within   principles 2 and 3.   Principle 2—Compatibility With   Effective Controls and Risk Management   Pursuant to Principle 2 of the   Guidance, a banking organization’s risk-   management processes and internal   controls should reinforce and support   the development and maintenance of   balanced incentive compensation   arrangements. Principle 2 states that   banking organizations should create and   maintain sufficient documentation to   permit an audit of the organization’s   processes for establishing, modifying,   and monitoring incentive compensation   arrangements.   Additionally, global systemically   important bank holding companies and   banking organizations subject to   Category II–IV enhanced prudential   standards under Regulation YY and   foreign banking organizations required   to form an intermediate holding   company under Regulation YY should   maintain policies and procedures that   (1) identify and describe the role(s) of   the personnel, business units, and   control units authorized to be involved   in the design, implementation, and   monitoring of incentive compensation   arrangements, (2) identify the source of   significant risk-related inputs into these   processes and establish appropriate   controls governing the development and   approval of these inputs to help ensure   their integrity, and (3) identify the   individual(s) and control unit(s) whose   approval is necessary for the   establishment of new incentive   compensation arrangements or   modification of existing arrangements.   Principle 3—Strong Corporate   Governance   Pursuant to Principle 3 of the   Guidance, banking organizations should   have strong and effective corporate   governance to help ensure sound   compensation practices. Principle 3   states that a banking organization’s   board of directors should approve and   document any material exceptions or   adjustments to the organization’s   incentive compensation arrangements   established for senior executives.   Legal authorization and   confidentiality:   The recordkeeping   provisions of the Guidance are   authorized pursuant to the Board’s   examination and reporting authorities,   located in sections 9, 11(a), 25, and 25A   of the Federal Reserve Act, section 5 of   the Bank Holding Company Act, section   10(b) of the Home Owners’ Loan Act,   and section 7(c) of the International   Banking Act, and by section 39 of the   Federal Deposit Insurance Act, which   authorizes the Board to prescribe   compensation standards.   Because the recordkeeping provisions   are contained within guidance, which is   nonbinding, they are voluntary. There   are no reporting forms associated with   this information collection.   Because the incentive compensation   records would be maintained at each   banking organization, the Freedom of   Information Act (FOIA) would only be   implicated if the Board obtained such   records as part of the examination or   supervision of a banking organization.   In the event the records are obtained by   the Board as part of an examination or   supervision of a banking organization,   this information may be considered   confidential pursuant to exemption 8 of   the FOIA, which protects information   contained in ‘‘examination, operating,   or condition reports’’ obtained in the   bank supervisory process. In addition,   the information may also constitute   nonpublic commercial or financial   information, which is both customarily   and actually treated as private by the   respondent, and thus may be kept   confidential by the Board pursuant to   exemption 4 of the FOIA.   Consultation outside the agency:   The   Board has consulted with the FDIC and   OCC and confirmed that there will be no   revisions to the guidance.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:   Description:   The Head Start REACH:   Strengthening Outreach, Recruitment   and Engagement Approaches with   Families project is proposing to conduct   qualitative case studies to examine the   approaches used by Head Start   programs to recruit, select, enroll, and   retain families experiencing adversities   and the implementation of these   approaches, including supporting   factors and barriers. Adversities is a   broad term that refers to a wide range   of circumstances or events that pose a   threat to a child or caregiver’s physical   or psychological well-being. The   adversities that families experience are   often intertwined with poverty, may co-   occur, and are affected by systematic   factors, such as structural racism.   Common examples include (but are not   limited to) families experiencing   homelessness; involvement in child   welfare, including foster care; and   affected by substance use, mental health   issues, and domestic violence.   We will collect information from six   sites; each site will include (1) a Head   Start program that has demonstrated   success in the RSER of families   experiencing adversities and (2) up to   four of its community partner   organizations that serve families   experiencing adversities.   We will collect information on how   programs determine which adversities   to focus on for their RSER efforts; RSER   approaches programs use, focusing   specifically on families experiencing   adversities; RSER-related training and   support that Head Start staff receive;   partnerships that programs form with   organizations in the community to   support these activities; and supporting   factors and barriers to participation of   enrolled and non-enrolled families who   face adversities.   Respondents:   Head Start program   directors, Head Start staff conducting   eligibility, recruitment, selection,   enrollment, attendance (ERSEA)   activities, staff from community   organizations with which Head Start   programs partner for ERSEA activities,   Head Start-eligible parents enrolled in   Head Start, and those not enrolled in   Head Start.

LIMRA,LIMRA: First Half of 2021 Had Highest U.S. Life Insurance Policy Sales Growth Since 1983,Streetinsider | Press Releases,StreetInsider.com,"LIMRA: First Half of 2021 Had Highest U.S. Life Insurance Policy Sales Growth Since 1983  WINDSOR, Conn., Sept. 1, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- In the first six months of 2021, the total number of policies sold increased 8%, compared with prior year results. This is the highest policy sales growth recorded since 1983, according to LIMRA's Second Quarter U.S. Individual Life Insurance Sales Survey.   Total U.S. life insurance premium increased 21% in the second quarter 2021, the largest year-over-year increase since third quarter 1987. For the first half of 2021, total premium increased 18%, compared with the first six months of 2020.  ""According to the 2021 Insurance Barometer study, 36% of Americans said they planned to purchase life insurance this year. For the second consecutive quarter, we see this purchase intent translate into strong sales results,"" said David Levenson, president and CEO, LIMRA, LOMA and LL Global. ""Following the record life insurance sales in the first quarter, most companies are reporting significant growth in premium and policy sales in the second quarter. Eight in 10 carriers reported positive premium growth, including each of the top 10 carriers.""  Whole life new premium jumped 25% in the second quarter and policy count increased 5%, compared with prior year. Whole life product sales experienced the largest growth in terms of absolute dollars and policies sold. Three quarters of whole life carriers reported positive growth, including nine of the top 10 carriers. Year to date (YTD), whole life premium was 22% higher than sales in the first six months of 2020. Whole life represented 36% of the U.S. life insurance market in the second quarter.  ""Last year, because of the shutdown, people were unable to meet with their advisors in person, and we saw significant growth in direct-to-consumer distribution for whole life products. In the second quarter 2020, D2C whole life sales rose by 33%,"" noted Levenson. ""In contrast, whole life sales growth this quarter was driven by independent and affiliated agent sales as the vaccines became available and more of the country opened.""  Indexed UL new premium grew 20% in the second quarter, up 17% YTD. Fixed UL new premium rose 7% for the quarter. In the first six months of 2021, fixed UL premium fell 2%.  Indexed UL represented 24% of total the premium in the second quarter. Fixed UL market share was 8%.  Variable UL (VUL) new premium grew 69%, compared with prior year results, representing the 15th consecutive quarter of premium increases. All but three VUL carriers reported double-digit increases. YTD, VUL premium increased 62% from prior year. While protection-focused VUL sales continued to increase (up 27% in the second quarter), accumulation-focused VUL sales jumped up 144% and claimed just over half the new VUL premium.  Continued low interest rates, strong equity markets and recent changes to tax law (IRC 7702) have made VUL products more attractive to consumers, driving their growth over the past several quarters. VUL held 11% market share in the second quarter. This is the highest market share for VUL since 2008.  In the second quarter, term life new premium was 8% higher than prior year with 65% of carriers reporting increases. In the first six months of 2021, term life new premium also increased 8%. Term life market share was 21% in the second quarter.  ""COVID-19 has raised consumers' awareness about the importance of having life insurance coverage. Nearly a third of consumers (31%) said they were more likely to purchase coverage due the pandemic,"" noted Levenson. ""This is so important because too many Americans live with a life insurance coverage gap, leaving their loved ones' financial security at risk. As we celebrate Life Insurance Awareness Month in September and continue our year-long Help Protect Our Families campaign, let's double our efforts to educate Americans about the importance of having adequate life insurance coverage.""  LIMRA's Second Quarter 2021 U.S. Individual Life Insurance Sales Survey represents approximately 80% of the U.S. individual life insurance annualized premium market.  The latest data table and additional statistics on U.S. life insurance sales trends can be viewed in the newly updated Fact Tank.

Overheard recently: “I just want a man who will make me laugh as we count his family’s money on his rock-hard abs.” Lenders are doing okay, money-wise, as we put another month under our belt. It wasn’t a particularly good month from the perspective of COVID, Afghanistan, hurricanes, or wildfires here’s a driver’s view). But it was a decent month for many lenders, and early indications point to the purchase market picking up and boosting numbers over July’s. Margin compression is related to origination channel, ranging from correspondent through wholesale and then to retail and direct-to-consumer. Lenders are seeing fewer extensions now as operational capacity has increased. At the “top of the funnel,” home building is well below historical norms, has been for years, and so catching up is difficult. In most markets, supply concerns outweigh credit issues. There are other things going on as well, like the NY “broker” who pled guilty to mortgage fraud and Fannie Mae reminding those impacted by Hurricane Ida of available mortgage assistance and disaster relief options.

Capital Markets  Economic data released over the last week did little to change the narrative of improving conditions albeit with continued heightened inflation. Personal income increased in July as wages improved due to the tight labor supply. Meanwhile, real consumer spending declined slightly as consumers shifted spending from manufactured goods to services. Inflation over the prior twelve months was at 4.2 percent in July, and existing home sales increased to a 5,990,000 annual rate amid a tight 2.6 months’ worth of inventory. The median price of an existing home was 17.8 percent higher than July 2020. Meanwhile, new home sales were at a 708,000 annual pace as inventories increased to 6.2 months’ worth. The average price of a new home hit $390,500, an increase of 18.4 percent from last July. And although Fed chair Jerome Powell mentioned Friday that the Fed may begin to reduce its monthly bond purchases prior to year’s end, actual short-term rate hikes were still a ways off.  This week began with optimism that Fed policy support due to the pandemic will be withdrawn cautiously and gradually, but traders are now waiting for Friday’s U.S. jobs data to assess whether the economic recovery merits an earlier tapering. We saw yesterday that U.S. home prices once again jumped the most in more than 30 years, largely due to tight inventory. As we saw from the latest FOMC minutes, the committee is focused on home price appreciation and how its MBS purchases affect price changes. Separately, consumer confidence dropped in August to the lowest level since February, suggesting concerns over the delta variant and elevated prices are weighing on Americans' views of the economy. Rounding out releases, the Chicago PMI fell in August from July.  Today’s economic calendar is out of the gate, and we have seen that mortgage applications decreased 2.4 percent from one week earlier, according to data from MBA’s Weekly Mortgage Applications Survey for the week ending August 27. As a prelude to Friday’s employment report, we’ve received the ADP employment for August (missing estimates and only +374k). Later this morning brings the final August Markit manufacturing PMI, ISM manufacturing PMI, and July construction spending. On the Fed front, Atlanta Fed President Bostic will speak this afternoon while the new month kicks off with the Desk purchasing up to $5.2 billion 30-year 2 percent and 2.5 percent. We begin the day with Agency MBS prices down slightly and the 10-year yielding 1.32 after closing yesterday at 1.30 percent.

Washington, DC 20426   Re:    ISO New England Inc.,   Docket No. ER21-__-000;   Ministerial Filing To Conform Exhibit IA, Financial Assurance Policy of the   ISO New England Inc. Transmission, Markets and Services Tariff to Reflect   all Commission-Accepted Language in the FERC eTariff eViewer    Dear Secretary Bose:   Pursuant to Section 205 of the Federal Power Act,  1    ISO New England Inc. (the “ISO”)   hereby submits this conforming filing to update the records of its Transmission, Markets and   Services Tariff (“Tariff”) in the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s (the “Commission”)   eTariff eViewer to ensure that the Tariff records in the eViewer properly reflect all Commission-  accepted language.  2    No changes are being made to previously-accepted language.     I.  DESCRIPTION OF THE FILING PARTIES; COMMUNICATIONS   The ISO is the private, non-profit entity that serves as the regional transmission   organization (“RTO”) for New England. The ISO plans and operates the New England bulk   power system and administers New England’s organized wholesale electricity markets pursuant   to the Tariff and the Transmission Operating Agreement with the New England Participating   Transmission Owners.  In its capacity as an RTO, the ISO has the responsibility to protect the   short-term reliability of the New England Control Area and to operate the system according to   reliability standards established by the Northeast Power Coordinating Council and the North   American Electric Reliability Corporation.   1    16 U.S.C. § 824d (2012).   2    Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined in this filing letter are intended to have the meaning given to such   terms in the Tariff.

DESCRIPTION OF THE REQUESTED CONFORMING CHANGES    On June 24, 2020, the ISO filed revisions to the Tariff to make enhancements to Exhibit   IA of the Tariff, the Financial Assurance Policy (the “FAP”).  These included enhancements to   credit provisions, updates to the form letter of credit, and other miscellaneous provisions   (“Revisions Related to Financial Assurance Policy Enhancements”).  3    The Commission issued a   letter order on September 2, 2020 accepting these revisions and they became effective September   10, 2020.  4  Due to administrative error, the Revisions Related to Financial Assurance Policy   Enhancements inadvertently omitted the following Commission-accepted language in   Attachment 3 of the Financial Assurance Policy and are redlined in this filing:   1  As used in this certification, a Certifying Entity’s “independent risk management   function” can include appropriate corporate persons or bodies that are independent of the   Certifying Entity’s trading functions, such as a risk management committee, a risk   officer, a Certifying Entity’s board or board committee, or a board or committee of the   Certifying Entity’s parent company.   There were two subsequent filings that also did omitted this language.  They were:   •  Revisions Related to Disclosure Information Under the FAP in Docket No. ER21-  816-000 filed January 6, 2021 with a requested effective date of March 9, 2021.  5  This filing was subsequently amended on February 23, 2021 to correct a formatting   3    See ISO New England Inc. and New England Power Pool  , Revisions to Tariff Related to FAP Enhancements,   Docket No. ER21-2145-000 (filed June 24, 2020) (“Revisions to Financial Assurance Policy”).   4    See   Delegated Letter Order, Docket No. ER20-2145-000 (issued September 2, 2020).   5    See ISO New England Inc. and New England Power Pool  , Revisions Related to Disclosure Information Under   FAP, Docket No. ER21-816-000 (filed January 6, 2021) (“Revisions to Financial Assurance Policy”).   The Honorable Kimberly D. Bose   September 1, 2021   Page 3 of 4   error.  6    The Commission accepted these revisions on March 3, 2021 and they became   effective March 9, 2021.  7       •    Revisions to Obligations of Energy Efficiency Resources Under PFP in Docket No.   ER21-943-000 filed on January 26, 2021,  8    accepted by the Commission on March 31,   2021, and became effective on April 1, 2021.  9  It is therefore necessary to update the eTariff eViewer so that Exhibit IV, Financial   Assurance Policy reflects all Commission-accepted language.   Materials included herewith are as follows:    •  This transmittal letter;    •  Clean and Blacklined Tariff of Exhibit IA, Financial Assurance Policy   incorporating the omitted, Commission-accepted language effective September   10, 2020; March 9, 2021; and April 1, 2021.

HIPAA - Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act,Utilizing Wellness Programs to Incentivize COVID-19 Vaccinations,The National Law Review | Latest Business Law News and Legal Analysis,The National Law Review,"Utilizing Wellness Programs to Incentivize COVID-19 Vaccinations  Wednesday, September 1, 2021 Delta Airlines made headlines this month by announcing that it will charge employees on its group health plan a $200 surcharge for failure to receive the COVID-19 vaccination. Although there is potential for conflict with a myriad of federal statutes — including the ACA, HIPAA, ADA, and GINA — this arrangement may be structured legally if done through a properly designed wellness program. This Alert is intended to assist employers in identifying the legal issues needed to be addressed when considering whether to implement a similar incentive program in their own workplace. Nondiscrimination Rules under the ACA and HIPAA Both the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) generally prohibit group health plans and insurers from using health factors to discriminate among similarly situated individuals, including the amount of premiums charged for coverage. Stated otherwise, the statutes do not allow employers to charge employees different premium amounts for group health coverage based solely on a single health factor, such as vaccination status. HIPAA’s nondiscrimination regulations, first issued in 2006, include an exception, however, that allows group health plans and health insurance issuers to establish different premium amounts if individuals adhere to the terms of a qualifying wellness program. Health care reform codified these HIPAA regulations into the provisions of the ACA and applied them to group health plans effective as of the first day of the plan year beginning on or after Jan. 1, 2014. Wellness Programs A wellness program is defined under the regulations as a “program of health promotion or disease prevention.” Wellness programs that comply with the regulations may offer participants a “reward,” which can be in the form of something affirmatively received (e.g., a discount or rebate of a premium or contribution), or something avoided (e.g., a penalty in the form of a premium surcharge). There are two types of wellness programs: Participatory wellness programs, in which none of the conditions for obtaining the reward is based on the individual satisfying a standard relating to a health factor (e.g., a program reimbursing the cost of a gym membership); and Health-contingent wellness programs, in which the individual is required to satisfy a standard related to a health factor in order to obtain the reward. Health-contingent wellness programs are broken down further into two subcategories: Activity-only wellness programs, which require an individual to complete an activity related to a health factor in order to obtain the reward, but does not require the individual to attain or maintain a specific health outcome (e.g., program requiring participants to walk X amount of steps per day); or Outcome-based wellness programs, which require an individual to attain or maintain a specific health outcome (e.g., to participate in a program with the ultimate goal is quitting tobacco, where the reward is contingent upon tobacco cessation). An employer adopting a wellness program with the reward based on the vaccination status of employees is a health-contingent wellness program and an activity-only wellness program. It is not a participatory wellness program, as the reward is conditioned upon the individual satisfying a standard relating to a health factor, but the individual is not required to attain or maintain a specific health outcome (it is possible that vaccinated individuals will still contract COVID-19). Requirements for Activity-Only Wellness Programs A health-contingent wellness program that is an activity-only wellness program qualifies for the exception to HIPAA and ACA’s nondiscrimination requirement only if the following requirements are satisfied: Frequency of Opportunity to Qualify. The program must give individuals eligible for the program the opportunity to receive the reward under the wellness program at least once per year. Size of Reward. The reward for the wellness program, together with the reward for other health-contingent wellness program with respect to the applicable group health plan, must not exceed 30% of the total cost of coverage. The cost of coverage is determined based on the total amount of employer AND employee contributions toward the cost of coverage. Example: The total cost of health coverage for an employee is $6,000 per year, of which he pays $2,000 (employer pays remaining $4,000). Under an eligible activity-only wellness program, the total reward for receiving the COVID vaccination could be up to $1,800 (30% * $6,000 = $1,800). Reasonable Design. The program must be “reasonably designed” to promote health or prevent disease. This requirement is satisfied if the program has a “reasonable chance of improving the health of, or preventing disease in, participating individuals, and it is not overly burdensome, is not a subterfuge for discriminating based on a health factor, and is not highly suspect in the method chosen to promote health or prevent disease.” This determination is made based on all facts and circumstances. Uniform Availability and Reasonable Alternative Standards. The full reward under the activity-only wellness program must be available to all similarly situated individuals. To achieve this, a wellness program must: Allow a reasonable alternative standard, or waiver of the standard, for obtaining the reward for any individual unable to achieve the standard due to a medical condition; and Allow a reasonable alternative standard, or waiver, for obtaining the reward for any individual for whom it is “medically inadvisable” to attempt to achieve the standard. In the case of the COVID vaccine, this means waiving the requirement for individuals with a valid medical reason for bypassing the COVID vaccine, with such individual eligible to receive the reward regardless of vaccination status. If reasonable under the facts and circumstances, a plan may seek verification that a health factor makes it difficult or inadvisable for the individual to achieve the standard, such as a statement from the individual’s doctor. Notice of Availability of Reasonable Alternative Standard. The plan must disclose in all plan materials describing the activity-only wellness program the availability of a reasonable alternative standard to qualify for the reward (i.e., the possibility of waiver). ADA Compliance Considerations To complicate matters further, in addition to the ACA and HIPAA, employers implementing a wellness program aimed at encouraging COVID vaccination amongst its employees must address the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (“ADA”). In particular, employers offering wellness programs need to consider the two rules under the ADA prohibiting (1) discrimination based on disability, and (2) disability-related medical examination and inquiries. Assuming a waiver option is offered to employees medically unable to receive the vaccine, only the second rule is implicated by a wellness program focused on vaccination status. Although the ADA prohibits disability-related medical examinations and inquiries, such prohibition is subject to two exceptions: If the medical examination or inquiry is “job-related and consistent with business necessity”; or For voluntary medical examination part of an employee health program, but only if such information is maintained pursuant to the confidentiality requirements of the ADA (separate from HIPAA privacy rules, which will also apply). The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (the “EEOC”), the federal agency tasked with enforcing the ADA, has published Q&As addressing this issue, explicitly stating that an employer may offer an incentive to employees to voluntarily provide documentation or other confirmation of a vaccination received; such a document request is “not a disability-related inquiry covered by the ADA.” Other requirements under the ADA for voluntary wellness programs include the following requirements: The program must be reasonably designed to promote health or prevent disease. The potential reward is capped at 30% of the total cost of coverage (based on both employer and employee contributions) — this is the same standard as under the ACA and HIPAA. The employer cannot coerce employees into participating in the program. Written notice of the program must be provided to all participants. Any information obtained by the employer through its administration of the program must be kept confidential per ADA regulations. GINA Compliance Considerations The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (“GINA”) may also be implicated by wellness programs focused on employee vaccination, but only if the employer or its agent is responsible for administering the COVID-19 vaccinations and the incentive is offered on the basis of a family member’s vaccination status. The EEOC has stated that there are no GINA compliance issues when an employer offers an employee an incentive to receive a COVID vaccination, regardless of whether the vaccination is administered by an independent third party of the employer or the employer’s agent. This is because the employer is only requesting proof of vaccination and not requesting genetic information. However, if the employer or the employer’s agent is administering the vaccine, GINA prevents the employer from offering an incentive to its employee on the basis of the employee’s family member’s vaccination. As a result, it is best practice if the COVID vaccine is administered by an independent third party, with the employer merely requesting proof of vaccination. No GINA issues result from this arrangement. Other Compliance Considerations Cafeteria Plans. In addition to the issues described above, attempting to roll out this program mid-plan year could trigger a number of related cafeteria plan issues (e.g., possible midyear election changes prompted by a significant reduction or increase in the cost of health care coverage due to a wellness reward). The easiest way to avoid any complications with respect to cafeteria plans is to structure the wellness program to align with the new plan year, with eligibility for the wellness benefit determined prior the new plan year (likely coinciding with open enrollment). Privacy and Confidentiality. HIPAA’s privacy rules and the ADA’s confidentiality rules apply to participant information obtained through participation in the wellness program. ACA Implications of Surcharge. As discussed above, wellness programs can be structured to offer a reward in the form of a premium surcharge or discount. If offered as a surcharge, however, employers should be aware that this will have the effect of increasing the cost of coverage for purposes of calculating affordability under the ACA and Section 4980H of the Internal Revenue Code. Potential Loss of Grandfather Status. HHS has published FAQs confirming that — for the duration of the federal emergency health declaration period relating to COVID-19 — plans will not lose grandfather status to the extent that a plan adds benefits or reduces or eliminates cost-sharing requirements. Once this period ends, however, grandfathered plans should review their wellness programs to ensure that such programs providing incentives for wellness in the form of premium discounts or surcharges are not jeopardizing the plan’s grandfathered status.

FINRA,"Yes, It is Possible to Negotiate a Reduced Punishment with FINRA Enforcement",BlawgSearch | Securities Law,Justia,"Yes, It is Possible to Negotiate a Reduced Punishment with FINRA Enforcement  Being a financial professional – i.e., a registered representative (RR) – regulated by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) is not easy. When misconduct is alleged against the RR in a complaint to FINRA, whether brought by a customer or the employing brokerage firm, the system that is set up to resolve such allegations and disputes generally treats the RR, at least initially, as “guilty until proven innocent.” Good luck finding a “neutral” fact-finder willing to listen; instead, you will often find an ambitious FINRA staffer, looking for another notch in his or her belt to help their stats and upward mobility.

But even when a financial…  Being a financial professional – i.e., a registered representative (RR) – regulated by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) is not easy. When misconduct is alleged against the RR in a complaint to FINRA, whether brought by a customer or the employing brokerage firm, the system that is set up to resolve such allegations and disputes generally treats the RR, at least initially, as “guilty until proven innocent.” Good luck finding a “neutral” fact-finder willing to listen; instead, you will often find an ambitious FINRA staffer, looking for another notch in his or her belt to help their stats and upward mobility. If and when FINRA decides to bring charges against the RR, it helps to have an attorney who can negotiate a reduced punishment against the RR.  To protect investors and market participants, RRs must abide by the securities laws and FINRA’s rules of conduct. But even when a financial professional follows those rules, every RR knows that they remain at the mercy of both customers and their firms, who, with little effort, whether fairly or unfairly, can very easily file a public complaint to put other customers or firms on notice about the RR.  If a customer files a complaint or arbitration against the RR, the complaint is reported to and logged on the RR’s public record of disclosure within the Central Registration Depository (CRD). Any person with Internet access can then view the pending allegations against the RR by visiting BrokerCheck.FINRA.org, where those allegations can additionally surface with a Google search.  If the RR’s firm files an allegation of wrongdoing against the RR, the disclosure is not as public, but it can still damage one’s career and livelihood because the defamatory nature of the U4 or U5 filing is viewable by all other regulated firms once the employing firm updates the RR’s CRD via a Form U4 amendment or U5. In such instances, the RR who is the subject of such allegations will find it nearly impossible to job search or interview with other firms while there is a pending investigation of any kind. To make matters worse, every complaint or violation reported by customers or firms is reviewed by FINRA Enforcement, who may then step in to levy additional public penalties consisting of suspensions, industry bars, and monetary fines.  For every customer complaint or firm-filed U4/U5 disclosure, there is certainty that FINRA Enforcement has looked at the filing. FINRA Enforcement will decide to open an investigation against you depending on how egregious or clear-cut the violation appears to be. Like any prosecutor’s office, you should expect that FINRA Enforcement is looking to prosecute an “easy” violation; that is, something easy to prove in which Enforcement is likely to prevail should it bring charges against you. Unlike powerful firms with a seat at FINRA’s table, with whom staffers often want a job, the “little guy” RR is looked at as an “easy kill,” especially if they know you are not a huge producer with money to fight them. Defense of an enforcement action can be costly.  Prior to bringing any charges against you, FINRA Enforcement will have likely conducted an investigation of some kind. While an investigation can be initiated quietly, behind the scenes, there are times when you will know this is occurring if you have already received an 8210 Letter requesting documents and information (i.e., similar to a subpoena), sometimes additionally accompanied by a request for you to testify on the record in front of Enforcement. It is important to retain counsel and come out strong from the get-go, as they need to believe you are not an “easy kill” and will fight them.  As FINRA is a self-regulatory organization, there is no threat of criminal liability in a proceeding when a civil action is brought by FINRA’s Enforcement arm; however, FINRA’s Enforcement Department has latitude to separately report any criminal violations to criminal authorities. Either way, a civil action brought by FINRA Enforcement presents a very real threat to your FINRA license and future ability to remain in the securities industry.  Though some lawyers might advise that not responding to a FINRA request for documents or testimony is the right course of action, especially if you have left or intend to leave the industry, one should know that failure to respond will typically result in an automatic bar from the industry with lasting effects. FINRA has continuing jurisdiction over you for two years after you leave the industry, and it will use that power. Sometimes it is easier and less costly to ignore FINRA rather than defending its allegations, especially where you know the allegations to be easily provable. However, the risk of defending oneself in a matter which Enforcement is likely to win can also make public specific facts about the allegations that might, in fact, be better off kept out of the public eye, whether viewed on Brokercheck or found on Google. It is important to assess just how damaging the underlying facts are, as they have the potential to haunt you in your next career. The decision should be carefully weighed with the help of an attorney, as, depending on the underlying facts, it can be just as damaging to your next career if a public search shows you were barred from the securities industry for failing to respond to FINRA Enforcement.  Lastly, it may be most helpful to hire an attorney when FINRA Enforcement advises that it intends to bring charges and specific penalties against you where the conduct alleged is in a “grey area,” where it is unclear, based on the facts, if Enforcement would prevail in a full hearing. Hearings are costly to defend for RRs, but it is also true that FINRA Enforcement’s resources are finite too. Consequently, if Enforcement can get you to accept a proposed punishment without expending the resources to prosecute you, it will do so, often creating the opportunity to “negotiate” for a lower suspension time or monetary penalty. It is to your advantage, thus, to have the proper negotiating leverage by hiring an experienced attorney who is familiar with precedents in other disciplinary proceedings, and who can create doubt or uncertainty with Enforcement about whether it can successfully prevail in a hearing. When being Googled or looked up on Brokercheck, a 10-day suspension looks a lot better than 10 months or a permanent industry bar. A $2,000 monetary fine looks a lot better than $10,000. Often the financial penalty can be further deferred or waived, provided your attorney can demonstrate that it would cause you financial hardship. In such circumstances, the New York attorneys at Malecki Law have successfully negotiated with FINRA Enforcement on behalf of RRs, resulting in lesser punishments and RRs being permitted to either resume their career in the financial industry or to move on to another career with minimal defamatory impact caused by a Google search.

LIMRA,"Life Insurance Premium Up 21% In The Second Quarter, LIMRA Reports",InsuranceNewsNet | Health Insurance,InsuranceNewsNet,"Life Insurance Premium Up 21% In The Second Quarter, LIMRA Reports  In the first six months of 2021, the total number of policies sold increased 8%, compared with prior year results. This is the highest policy sales growth recorded since 1983, according to LIMRA’s Second Quarter U.S. Individual Life Insurance Sales Survey.  Total U.S. life insurance premium increased 21% in the second quarter 2021, the largest year-over-year increase since third quarter 1987. For the first half of 2021, total premium increased 18%, compared with the first six months of 2020.  “According to the 2021 Insurance Barometer study, 36% of Americans said they planned to purchase life insurance this year. For the second consecutive quarter, we see this purchase intent translate into strong sales results,” said David Levenson, president and CEO, LIMRA, LOMA and LL Global. “Following the record life insurance sales in the first quarter, most companies are reporting significant growth in premium and policy sales in the second quarter. Eight in 10 carriers reported positive premium growth, including each of the top 10 carriers.”  Whole life new premium jumped 25% in the second quarter and policy count increased 5%, compared with prior year. Whole life product sales experienced the largest growth in terms of absolute dollars and policies sold. Three quarters of whole life carriers reported positive growth, including nine of the top 10 carriers. Year to date (YTD), whole life premium was 22% higher than sales in the first six months of 2020. Whole life represented 36% of the U.S. life insurance market in the second quarter.  “Last year, because of the shutdown, people were unable to meet with their advisors in person, and we saw significant growth in direct-to-consumer distribution for whole life products. In the second quarter 2020, D2C whole life sales rose by 33%,” noted Levenson. “In contrast, whole life sales growth this quarter was driven by independent and affiliated agent sales as the vaccines became available and more of the country opened.”  Indexed UL new premium grew 20% in the second quarter, up 17% YTD. Fixed UL new premium rose 7% for the quarter. In the first six months of 2021, fixed UL premium fell 2%.  Indexed UL represented 24% of total the premium in the second quarter. Fixed UL market share was 8%.  Variable UL (VUL) new premium grew 69%, compared with prior year results, representing the 15th consecutive quarter of premium increases. All but three VUL carriers reported double-digit increases. YTD, VUL premium increased 62% from prior year. While protection-focused VUL sales continued to increase (up 27% in the second quarter), accumulation-focused VUL sales jumped up 144% and claimed just over half the new VUL premium.  Continued low interest rates, strong equity markets and recent changes to tax law (IRC 7702) have made VUL products more attractive to consumers, driving their growth over the past several quarters. VUL held 11% market share in the second quarter. This is the highest market share for VUL since 2008.  In the second quarter, term life new premium was 8% higher than prior year with 65% of carriers reporting increases. In the first six months of 2021, term life new premium also increased 8%. Term life market share was 21% in the second quarter.  “COVID-19 has raised consumers’ awareness about the importance of having life insurance coverage. Nearly a third of consumers (31%) said they were more likely to purchase coverage due the pandemic,” noted Levenson. “This is so important because too many Americans live with a life insurance coverage gap, leaving their loved ones’ financial security at risk. As we celebrate Life Insurance Awareness Month in September and continue our year-long Help Protect Our Families campaign, let’s double our efforts to educate Americans about the importance of having adequate life insurance coverage.”  LIMRA’s Second Quarter 2021 U.S. Individual Life Insurance Sales Survey represents approximately 80% of the U.S. individual life insurance annualized premium market."

The Purchased Assets include, among other assumed assets, certain contracts with the Target's clients, permits owned, held and used by the Novo Group, intellectual property as well as tangible assets, and all of Target's accounts receivable.

(c)Continued Employment Following Expiration of Term. Nothing in this Agreement shall mandate or prohibit a continuation of Executive’s employment following the expiration of the term of this Agreement, upon such terms and conditions as the Bank and Executive may mutually agree.  (d)Duties; Membership on Other Boards. During the term of this Agreement, except for periods of absence occasioned by illness, reasonable vacation periods, and reasonable leaves of absence approved by the Board, Executive shall devote substantially all of his business time, attention, skill, and efforts to the faithful performance of his duties hereunder, including activities and services related to his position as Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; provided, however, that, Executive may serve, or continue to serve, on the boards of directors of, and hold any other offices or positions in, business companies or business or civic organizations, which, in the Board’s judgment, will not present any conflict of interest with the Bank, or materially affect the performance of Executive’s duties pursuant to this Agreement. Executive shall provide the Board of Directors annually for its approval a list of organizations for which the Executive acts as a director or officer.  (b)Bonus Compensation.  (i)Signing Bonus. Within thirty days of commencement of employment, Executive will be entitled to a signing bonus of $50,000.  (ii)Annual Bonus. Executive will be eligible for an annual performance-based bonus of up to 30% of base salary, based on the criteria determined by the Board. Said performance-based bonus shall be prorated for the 2021 calendar year. Additionally, Executive will be eligible for a discretionary bonus in the sole discretion of the Board. Executive shall be entitled to equitable participation in incentive compensation and bonuses in any plan or arrangement of the Bank or the Company in which Executive is eligible to participate. Nothing paid to Executive under any such plan or arrangement will be deemed to be in lieu of other compensation to which Executive is entitled under this Agreement.  (c)Employee Benefits. The Bank shall provide Executive with employee benefit plans, arrangements and perquisites substantially equivalent to those in which Executive was participating or from which he was deriving benefit immediately prior to the commencement of the term of this Agreement, and the Bank shall not, without Executive’s prior written consent, make any changes in such plans, arrangements or perquisites that would adversely affect Executive’s rights or benefits thereunder, except as to any changes that are applicable to all participating employees. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of this Section 3(c), Executive will be entitled to participate in and receive benefits under any employee benefit plans including, but not limited to, retirement plans, supplemental retirement plans, pension plans, profit-sharing plans, health-and-accident insurance plans, medical coverage or any other employee benefit plan or arrangement made available by the Bank and/or the Company in the future to its senior executives, including any stock benefit plans, subject to and on a basis consistent with the terms, conditions and overall administration of such plans and arrangements.  (d)Paid Time Off. Executive shall be entitled to paid vacation time each year during the term of this Agreement (measured on a fiscal or calendar year basis, in accordance with the Bank’s usual practices), as well as sick leave, holidays and other paid absences in accordance with the Bank’s policies and procedures for senior executives. Such paid time off shall not be in excess of 75 hours in 2021 and 300 hours for each calendar year thereafter. Any unused paid time off during an annual period shall be treated in accordance with the Bank’s personnel policies as in effect from time to time.

(A)failure to appoint Executive to the position set forth in Section 1, or a material change in Executive’s function, duties, or responsibilities, which change would cause Executive’s position to become one of lesser responsibility, importance, or scope from the position and responsibilities described in Section 1, to which Executive has not agreed in writing (and any such material change shall be deemed a continuing breach of this Agreement by the Bank);  (B)a relocation of Executive’s principal place of employment to a location that is more than 35miles from the location of the Bank’s principal executive offices as of the date of this Agreement;  (C)a material reduction in the benefits and perquisites, including Base Salary, to Executive from those being provided as of the Effective Date (except for any reduction that is part of a reduction in pay or benefits that is generally applicable to officers or employees of the Bank);  (D)a liquidation or dissolution of the Bank; or  (E)a material breach of this Agreement by the Bank.  Upon the occurrence of any event described in clause (ii) above, Executive shall have the right to elect to terminate his employment under this Agreement by resignation for “Good Reason” upon not less than thirty (30) days prior written notice given within a reasonable period of time (not to exceed ninety (90) days) after the event giving rise to the right to elect, which termination by Executive shall be an Event of Termination. The Bank shall have thirty (30) days to cure the condition giving rise to the Event of Termination, provided that the Bank may elect to waive said thirty (30) day period. For the avoidance of doubt, the non-renewal of this Agreement under Section 2(a) hereof, without the occurrence of an Event of Termination under this Section 4(a)(ii) prior to the end of the term of this Agreement, shall not be considered an event that would permit the Executive to resign for Good Reason and receive a severance payment.  (b)Upon the occurrence of an Event of Termination, the Bank shall pay Executive, or, in the event of his subsequent death, his beneficiary or beneficiaries, or his estate, as the case may be, as severance pay or liquidated damages, or both, the Base Salary and bonus(es) that Executive would be entitled to for the remaining unexpired term of the Agreement. For purposes of determining the bonus(es) payable hereunder, the bonus(es) will be deemed to be equal to the average annual bonus paid over the prior two years, and (ii) otherwise paid at such time as such bonus would have been paid absent an Event of Termination (i.e., if only one bonus would otherwise be paid during the remaining term, then one bonus will be included in the calculation). Such payments shall be paid in a lump sum on or before the 30th day following the Executive’s Separation from Service (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code), unless the payment is due in connection with a termination program involving more than one employee, in which case the payment shall be due within no more than the 60th day following Executive’s Separation from Service, and shall not be reduced in the event Executive obtains other employment following the Event of Termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Executive shall not be entitled to any payments or benefits under this Section 4 unless and until (i) Executive executes a release of his claims against the Bank, the Company and any affiliate, and their officers, directors, successors and assigns, releasing said persons from any and all claims, rights, demands, causes of action, suits, arbitrations or grievances relating to the employment relationship, including claims under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, but not including claims for benefits under tax-qualified plans or other benefit plans in which Executive is vested, claims for benefits required by applicable law or claims with respect to obligations set forth in this Agreement that survive the termination of this Agreement (the “Release”), and (ii) the payments and benefits shall begin on the 30th day following the date of the Executive’s Separation from Service, provided that before that date, the Executive has signed (and not revoked) the Release and the Release is irrevocable under the time period set forth under applicable law.

False Claims Act,Judge conditionally approves settlement in OxyContin maker Purdue bankruptcy case,WTVD-TV | Updates,WTVD-TV,"Judge conditionally approves settlement in OxyContin maker Purdue bankruptcy case  The settlement would remove the Sackler family from ownership of OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma and devote potentially $10 billion to fighting the opioid crisis.  WHITE PLAINS, New York -- A federal bankruptcy judge gave conditional approval Wednesday to a sweeping settlement that will remove the Sackler family from ownership of OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma and devote potentially $10 billion to fighting the opioid crisis that has killed a half-million Americans over the past two decades.  If it withstands appeals, the deal will resolve a mountain of 3,000 lawsuits from state and local governments, Native American tribes, unions and others that accuse the company of helping to spark the overdose epidemic by aggressively marketing the prescription painkiller.  Under the settlement, the Sacklers will have to get out of the opioid business altogether and contribute $4.5 billion. But they will be shielded from any future lawsuits over opioids.  The drugmaker itself will be reorganized into a new charity-oriented company with a board appointed by public officials and will funnel its profits into government-led efforts to prevent and treat addiction.  Also, the settlement sets up a compensation fund that will pay some victims of drugs an expected $3,500 to $48,000 each.  After an all-day hearing in which he analyzed the plan's pros and cons for a nonstop 6 1/2 hours, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain said he would approve it as long as two relatively small changes were made. If so, he said, he will formally enter the decision on Thursday.  He said that while he does not have ""fondness for the Sacklers or sympathy for them,"" collecting money from them through lawsuits instead of a settlement would be complicated.  The deal comes nearly two years after the Stamford, Connecticut-based company filed for bankruptcy under the weight of the lawsuits.  Under the settlement, the Sacklers were not given immunity from criminal charges, though there have been no indications they will face any.  RELATED: Drug overdose deaths spike amid COVID-19 pandemic  State and local governments came to support the plan overwhelmingly, if grudgingly in many cases. But nine states and others had opposed it, largely because of the protections granted to the family.  The attorneys general of Connecticut, the District of Columbia and Washington state immediately announced they will either appeal the ruling or explore the possibility of doing so.  The Sacklers ""should not be allowed to manipulate bankruptcy laws to evade justice and protect their blood money,"" Connecticut's William Tong said.  Some families who lost loved ones to drugs also came out against the settlement, including Ed Bisch, of Westampton, New Jersey, whose 18-year-old son died of an overdose nearly 20 years ago. ""The Sacklers are buying their immunity,"" he said.  But other families said they did not want to risk losing the money that will go toward treatment and prevention.  ""If they gave me a million dollars, would it help bring back my son?"" said Lynn Wencus, of Wrentham, Massachusetts. ""Let's help the people who are really struggling with this disease.""  In a statement, members of the Sackler family said: ""While we dispute the allegations that have been made about our family, we have embraced this path in order to help combat a serious and complex public health crisis.""  Purdue chairman Steve Miller said the settlement averts ""years of value-destructive litigation"" and ""ensures that billions of dollars will be devoted to helping people and communities who have been hurt by the opioid crisis.""  The bankruptcy judge, based in White Plains, New York, had urged the holdouts to work out an agreement for the same reason.  ""Bitterness over the outcome of this case is completely understandable,"" Drain said. ""But one also has to look at the process and the issues and risks and rewards and alternatives of continued litigation versus the settlement laid out in the plan.""  Some of the opioid deaths over the past two decades have been attributed to OxyContin and other prescription painkillers, but most are from illicit forms of opioids such as heroin and illegally produced fentanyl. Opioid-linked deaths in the U.S. continued at a record pace last year, hitting 70,000.  The crisis devastated the reputation of the Sackler family, major philanthropists whose name was once emblazoned on the walls of museums and universities around the world. With the settlement, family members who have owned the company will still be worth billions. Another branch of the Sackler family has had no involvement with Purdue for decades.  Whether the deal holds the Sacklers sufficiently accountable was the most contentious question through the proceedings. Those suing succeeded in boosting the amount the Sacklers would pay from a likely $3 billion.  David Sackler, a former Purdue board member, had testified that family members would not accept the agreement unless it protected them from lawsuits. Otherwise, he said, the family would defend itself in litigation that could drag on for years and eat up the company's and the family's assets in lawyers' fees.  His father, Richard Sackler, a former Purdue president and board chairman, said under questioning that he, his family and the company did not bear responsibility for the opioid crisis.  Drain noted that none of the four Sacklers who testified offered an explicit apology. ""A forced apology is not really an apology, so we will have to live without one,"" he said.  The judge requested two somewhat technical changes to the plan: one clarifying that Sackler family members would be protected only from lawsuits involving opioids, and one on the procedure for bringing non-opioid claims against them.  One projection commissioned by a group of attorneys general found that the family's wealth could rise from the current estimate of $10.7 billion to more than $14 billion by 2030 despite the required payments. That's because the family could continue to benefit from investment returns and interest as they make their gradual contributions over a decade under the deal.  Lawyers for Purdue and branches of the Sackler family disputed the assumptions used in the projection.  RELATED: Pharmaceutical companies reach a $260M settlement ahead of 1st federal trial on opioid crisis  The settlement also requires members of the Sackler family, who are scattered across the U.S., Britain and elsewhere in Europe, to get out of the opioid business worldwide.  Several attorneys general won another provision that will create a massive public repository of company documents, including ones that normally would be protected by attorney-client privilege.  Purdue has said the settlement overall will be worth about $10 billion, which includes the value of addiction treatment and overdose antidote drugs it is developing.  The bankruptcy case is not the first time Purdue had faced legal trouble over the marketing of its painkillers.  The company pleaded guilty in 2007 to federal charges it misled regulators and others about the addiction dangers of OxyContin and agreed to pay more than $600 million in penalties.  Last November, as part of a settlement with the U.S. Justice Department, Purdue pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud the United States and violating anti-kickback laws.  Purdue's bankruptcy has been the highest-profile case in a complicated universe of opioid litigation.  Drugmaker Johnson & Johnson and the three largest U.S. drug distribution companies recently announced a settlement that could be worth up to $26 billion if state and local governments agree.  Individual trials also remain, including one scheduled to start in October in Cleveland over the role pharmacies played in the crisis. Other trials have been held this year in California, New York and West Virginia, though verdicts have yet to be reached.  Associated Press writer John Seewer in Toledo, Ohio, contributed to this report."

At the same time, the department filed a proposed settlement, subject to approval by the court, under which Fairbank has agreed to pay a $637,950 civil penalty to resolve the lawsuit.  The HSR Act imposes notification and waiting period requirements for transactions meeting certain size thresholds so that they can undergo pre-transaction antitrust review. Federal courts can assess civil penalties for pre-transaction notification violations under the HSR Act in lawsuits brought by the department. The maximum civil penalty for an HSR Act violation, which is adjusted annually, is currently $43,792 per day.  Further details about this matter are described in the FTC’s press release issued today, and in the attached complaint and competitive impact statement.  Consistent with the requirements of the Tunney Act, the proposed settlement, along with the competitive impact statement, will be published in the Federal Register. Any person may submit written comments concerning the proposed settlement during a 60-day comment period via email to bccompliance@ftc.gov or by post to Maribeth Petrizzi, Special Attorney, United States, c/o Federal Trade Commission, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, CC-8416, Washington, D.C. 20580.

In the event that the provisions of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code are repealed without succession, this Section shall be of no further force or effect.

False Claims Act,The Department of Justice (“DOJ”) Continues its Medicare Advantage (“MA”) Enforcement Efforts with a $90 Million Dollar Settlement Against Downstream Provider Sutter Health,The National Law Review | Latest Business Law News and Legal Analysis,The National Law Review,"The Department of Justice (“DOJ”) Continues its Medicare Advantage (“MA”) Enforcement Efforts with a $90 Million Dollar Settlement Against Downstream Provider Sutter Health  Thursday, September 2, 2021 On August 30, 2021, the DOJ announced a $90 million dollar settlement with Sutter Health and affiliates[1] (“Sutter Health”) to settle False Claims Act (“FCA”) allegations brought by qui tam relator, Kathy Ormsby, related to the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services’ (“CMS”) MA Program.[2] Sutter Health elected to settle with DOJ and the relator without an admission of liability. As part of the Settlement Agreement, the Office of Inspector General (“OIG”) required Sutter Health to enter into a Corporate Integrity Agreement. The MA Program Under the MA program, CMS pays Medicare Advantage Organizations (“MAOs”) a capitated amount for each beneficiary to cover the costs associated with providing health care services typically covered under traditional Medicare. These payments are “risk adjusted” for certain demographic factors as well as the health status of the beneficiary. The latter is established through the submission of diagnosis codes to CMS, some of which trigger an additional payment that correlates to the predicted costs of care associated with treating that condition, otherwise referred to as “risk adjusted diagnosis codes”. The more risk adjusted diagnosis codes submitted, the higher the payment to the MAO. The Core Allegations Sutter Health, headquartered in California, is comprised of hospitals, medical foundations and other medical service entities. It contracts with MAOs to provide and manage health care services to health plan MA enrollees under a capitated arrangement, whereby the MAO would pay a portion, often times a majority, of the capitated payment it receives from CMS to Sutter Health. The DOJ contended that Sutter Health violated the FCA by knowingly submitting, or causing to be submitted, risk adjusted diagnosis codes that were false, or unsupported by the underlying medical record causing CMS to make improperly inflated payments to MAOs, and ultimately Sutter Health. In addition, the DOJ believed Sutter Health became aware of diagnosis codes that were not supported by the medical record and failed to take corrective action to identify and delete additional potentially unsupported codes.[3] Allegations focused on a number of provider initiated activities that can drive risk adjustment scores and corresponding payments, including physician education and engagement, risk adjustment score tracking, coder involvement, physician incentives, queries to elicit certain diagnostic coding, and pre-populated problem lists. These activities, themselves are not necessarily problematic, provided the output, diagnostic coding is accurate. DOJ’s primary focus was the alleged failure of the organization to have an effective compliance program in place to conduct adequate internal monitoring and respond to, or follow up with, the results of both internal and external auditing efforts in light of what the DOJ classifies as aggressive risk code chasing activities. Risk Adjustment Enforcement Is Not Just Plan Issue; MA Downstream Entities Should Proceed with Caution Sutter’s settlement is the most recent of a number of government enforcement actions taken against downstream Medicare Advantage risk bearing organizations pursued under both a “causes to be submitted” and “reverse false claims” theories.

FINRA,"Did Robinhood Employees Trade GameStop and AMC Before Robinhood’s Public Announcement to Restrict Trading on January 28, 2021?",BlawgSearch | Securities Law,Justia,"Iorio Altamirano  Did Robinhood Employees Trade GameStop and AMC Before Robinhood’s Public Announcement to Restrict Trading on January 28, 2021?  On September 1, 2021, Robinhood ($Hood) filed its first amendment to its Form S-1 Registration Statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The public filing, which amends the registration statement that Robinhood filed in connection with its July 2021 initial public offering (IPO), discloses that the SEC’s Division of Examinations and Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) have submitted inquires to Robinhood related to whether any employee executed trades in certain securities, including GameStop Corp. and AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc., before the public announcement that Robinhood would restrict trading in those securities on January 28, 2021. On Thursday, January 28, 2021, Robinhood designated specific stocks “position closing only,” restricting its customers from purchasing additional shares in those stocks. The targeted stocks included GameStop (NYSE: GME), AMC (NYSE: AMC), Blackberry (NYSE: BB),…  On September 1, 2021, Robinhood ($Hood) filed its first amendment to its Form S-1 Registration Statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).  The public filing, which amends the registration statement that Robinhood filed in connection with its July 2021 initial public offering (IPO), discloses that the SEC’s Division of Examinations and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) have submitted inquires to Robinhood related to whether any employee executed trades in certain securities, including GameStop Corp. and AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc., before the public announcement that Robinhood would restrict trading in those securities on January 28, 2021.  On Thursday, January 28, 2021, Robinhood designated specific stocks “position closing only,” restricting its customers from purchasing additional shares in those stocks. The targeted stocks included GameStop (NYSE: GME), AMC (NYSE: AMC), Blackberry (NYSE: BB), Nokia (NYSE: NOK), Koss Corporation (NYSE: KOSS), and Express, Inc. (NYSE: EXPR).  Robinhood was joined by other online brokers who all implemented trading restrictions on targeted securities. These online brokerage firms, including Robinhood, intentionally deprived their customers, without notice, of the ability to use their service to slow the growth of the targeted “meme stock” securities.  As the trading restrictions were put into place by the online brokerage firms, including Robinhood, retail investors watched helplessly as the value of their positions plummeted with no potential to remediate the positions given the wrongful sale pressure initiated by Robinhood and others.  Now it appears possible that at least some Robinhood employees were able to execute trades in advance of the company’s public announcement that it would implement trading restrictions, potentially protecting themselves from the wreckage to come caused by their employer.  Investors who have been harmed should not feel discouraged. Many retail investors across the country are fighting back and filing lawsuits in the form of securities arbitration complaints to recover losses from Robinhood as a result of its unprecedented decision to place trading restrictions on stocks of publicly traded companies on January 28, 2021, amid an unprecedented rise in stock prices.  Recently, a 26-year-old truck driver from Connecticut, represented by Iorio Altamirano LLP, filed a securities arbitration claim alleging that Robinhood’s negligence caused the share prices of his stock positions to fall, causing significant financial loss.  What is Securities Arbitration?  Arbitration is an alternative dispute resolution process. When an investor suffers investment losses due to misconduct by a financial advisor or broker-dealer, the investor can file a securities arbitration claim against their financial advisor or brokerage firm in an effort to be compensated. Arbitration is the primary forum for resolving disputes between investors and brokerage firms because it is a contractual obligation. The customer and broker-dealer contractually agree to use arbitration to resolve disputes when the customer opens a brokerage account and signs the customer agreement that includes an arbitration clause.

Robinhood is already facing regulatory investigations and litigation, including securities arbitrations, related to its decision to place trading restrictions on “meme stocks,” such as GameStop (NYSE: GME), AMC (NYSE: AMC), Blackberry (NYSE: BB), Nokia (NYSE: NOK), Koss Corporation (NYSE: KOSS), and Express, Inc. (NYSE: EXPR), on January 28, 2021.  Robinhood is also facing regulatory investigations and customer arbitration disputes related to its options trading approval process.  Iorio Altamirano LLP, a securities arbitration law firm in New York, is filing claims on behalf of Robinhood customers who suffered harmed due to the January 2021 trading restrictions or who were approved to trade options by Robinhood but did not satisfy eligibility requirements. For more about the investigations, click on the following links:  Iorio Altamirano LLP Investigating Robinhood for January 2021 Trading Restrictions  Investor Alert: Iorio Altamirano LLP Investigates Robinhood for Failing to Exercise Due Diligence Before Approving Options Accounts  January 2021 Trading Restrictions  Robinhood and its Co-Founder and CEO, Vladimir Tenev, among others, have received requests for information, and in some cases, subpoenas and requests for testimony, related to investigations and examinations of the early 2021 trading restrictions from the United States Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California (“USAO”), the U.S. Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, the SEC staff, FINRA, the New York Attorney General’s Office, other state attorneys general offices and several state securities regulators. Also, a related search warrant was executed by the USAO to obtain Mr. Tenev’s cell phone.  Robinhood has also received inquiries from the SEC’s Division of Examinations and FINRA related to employee trading in certain securities that were subject to Robinhood’s trading restrictions on January 28, 2021, including GameStop Corp. and AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. According to the public filing, the regulatory probes relate to whether any employee executed trades in the subject securities in advance of the public announcement of the early 2021 trading restrictions on January 28, 2021.  In addition, Robinhood has received information and testimony requests from certain committees and members of the U.S. Congress, and Mr. Tenev, among others, has provided or will provide testimony concerning the January 2021 trading restrictions.  Many individual retail investors felt cheated and wronged when Robinhood restricted customers from purchasing specific securities on January 28, 2021, and are filing lawsuits in the form of securities arbitration complaints and class actions to recover losses.  Robinhood’s public filing also discloses that approximately 50 putative class actions have been filed relating to the early 2021 trading restrictions. The public filing does not disclose the number of FINRA arbitrations that customers have filed, but upon information and belief, dozens, perhaps hundreds, of claims have been filed.  Recently, a 26-year-old truck driver from Connecticut, represented by Iorio Altamirano LLP, filed a securities arbitration claim alleging that Robinhood’s decision to halt the purchase of securities by retail investors caused the share prices of the publicly traded companies to fall, resulting in losses.  Options Trading Approval Process  On June 30, 2021, FINRA and Robinhood entered into a Letter of Acceptance, Waiver, and Consent, whereby Robinhood consented to pay the largest financial penalty ever levied by FINRA, $70 million, for alleged systemic supervisory failures and significant harm suffered by millions of customers. Among those supervisory failures was the firm’s failure to exercise due diligence before approving options accounts.  The latest SEC filing includes the disclosure of several regulatory investigations and enforcement actions related to Robinhood’s options trading approval process.  First, the filing discloses that the SEC is conducting an examination, and FINRA and certain state regulatory authorities are conducting investigations regarding Robinhood’s options trading and related customer communications and displays. The SEC, FINRA, and state regulatory authorities are reviewing, among other things, how Robinhood displays cash and buying power to customers and its options trading approval processes.  Second, the filing discloses that on February 8, 2021, the family of Alexander Kearns, a Robinhood customer who traded options, filed a lawsuit in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Santa Clara, against RHF, RHS, and RHM in connection with Mr. Kearns’s death by suicide in June 2020. The lawsuit asserts claims for wrongful death, negligent infliction of emotional distress, and unfair business practices under a California statute, and seeks damages and other relief.  Third, the Amendment to the Form S-1 discloses that on December 16, 2020, the Enforcement Section of the Massachusetts Securities Division filed an administrative complaint against Robinhood. The Complaint alleges three counts of Massachusetts securities law violations regarding unethical and dishonest conduct or practices, failure to supervise, and failure to act in accordance with the Massachusetts fiduciary duty standard. Among other things, the Massachusetts Securities Division alleged that Robinhood’s product features and marketing strategies, outages, and options trading approval process constitute violations of Massachusetts securities laws.  Finally, the public filing discloses that Robinhood is engaged in discussions with FINRA regarding a possible negotiated resolution of certain FINRA matters, including options trading and related customer communications and displays noted above.  Recently, a 36-year-old nightclub doorman, represented by Iorio Altamirano LLP, filed a securities arbitration claim alleging that he suffered losses as a result of Robinhood’s failure to exercise due diligence before approving his options trading account, a direct result of Robinhood’s overreliance on technology and its failure to supervise the operation and maintenance of its technology.

Hart-Scott-Rodino Act,"Capital One CEO Fined $640,000 For Allegedly Boosting $168 Million Stock Holdings Through Illegal Transactions",Forbes | U.S. Edition,Forbes,"Capital One CEO Fined $640,000 For Allegedly Boosting $168 Million Stock Holdings Through Illegal Transactions  Topline  Capital One Cofounder and CEO Richard Fairbank has been ordered to pay a $637,950 civil penalty to settle charges he violated antitrust laws by repeatedly failing to report stock transactions associated with his compensation package over the past two decades, the Federal Trade Commission announced Thursday.  In a complaint released Thursday, the FTC alleges Fairbank illegally acquired 101,148 shares of Capital One voting stock in 2018 because he failed to first notify the agency and the Department of Justice, as required by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act of 1976, which aims to curb antitrust practices by allowing regulators to investigate transactions.  The acquisitions boosted Fairbank's holdings to more than $168.8 million at the time, far more than the $100 million threshold requiring disclosure under the HSR Act, the FTC said.   According to the complaint, Fairbank previously failed to comply with the HSR Act on two other occasions since 1999, though the FTC gave him a ""free pass"" after he pledged to ensure the required HSR notifications would be filed going forward.  In a statement, Capital One Spokesperson Sie Soheili said Fairbank missed the filing obligation in 2018 ""due to administrative errors"" by the firm and that his personal law firm has agreed to pay the fine ""as a result of its mistake.""  Crucial Quote  “As the CEO of one of America’s largest banks, Richard Fairbank repeatedly broke the law,” FTC official Holly Vedova said in a Thursday statement. “There is no exemption for Wall Street bankers and powerful CEOs when it comes to complying with our country’s antitrust laws.”  Key Background  Fairbank cofounded Capital One in 1988 and took the company public as CEO in 1994 before building it into one of the nation's largest banks. It posted $26 billion in revenue last year and has amassed a market capitalization of more than $72 billion. According to Fairbank's latest disclosure, filed in July, he still owns about $60 million worth of Capital One stock. Meanwhile, Fairbank isn't alone among big banking executives facing the ire of regulators. In November, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged two former Wells Fargo executives, including onetime CEO and Chairman John G. Stumpf, for allegedly misleading investors about the success of the bank's largest business segment in 2015 and 2016.  I'm a reporter at Forbes focusing on markets and finance.

Hart-Scott-Rodino Act,FTC fines Capital One CEO Richard Fairbank over stock awards,American Banker | Law & Regulations,American Banker,"FTC fines Capital One CEO Richard Fairbank over stock awards  The Federal Trade Commission fined Capital One Financial Chief Executive Richard Fairbank for failing to properly report stock awards to federal antitrust authorities.  Fairbank received 100,000 Capital One shares as part of his pay package in 2018 and didn’t wait for authorities to investigate before finalizing the acquisition of the shares, the FTC said. While Fairbank agreed to pay a $637,950 civil penalty to settle the charges, Capital One said his personal law firm has agreed to pay the full amount of the fine because the filing error was “due to administrative errors by the firm.”  The FTC alleged that the moves violated the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, which requires companies and individuals to report large transactions to the FTC and the Justice Department so they can investigate the deals before they’re completed. Fairbank had received two previous warnings for failing to properly comply with the law, in 1999 and 2004, the FTC said.  “As the CEO of one of America’s largest banks, Richard Fairbank repeatedly broke the law,” Holly Vedova, acting director of the FTC’s Bureau of Competition, said in a statement Thursday. “There is no exemption for Wall Street bankers and powerful CEOs when it comes to complying with our country’s antitrust laws.”  Fairbank is a rarity in financial circles since he’s both the founder and the chief executive officer of one of the country’s largest banks. The 70-year-old’s net worth has soared alongside Capital One’s stock, and he became a billionaire in 2018, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.  “For many years, Mr. Fairbank has been advised on his personal disclosure responsibilities by a well-respected international law firm,” Capital One said in an emailed statement. “As soon as his counsel identified the firm’s error, Mr. Fairbank promptly self-reported to the FTC and submitted a corrective HSR filing. His personal law firm has agreed to pay the full amount of the fine as a result of its mistake.”"
US Securities & Exchange Commission,SEC Scrutinizes Use of Fintech by Broker-Dealers and Investment Advisers,The Lexblog Network | Corporate & Commercial,LexBlog,"Madison Gaudreau  SEC Scrutinizes Use of Fintech by Broker-Dealers and Investment Advisers  The Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) recently issued a request for information and public comment on the use of new and emerging technologies by investment advisers and broker-dealers that suggests potential regulatory action to come.[1] According to its release, the SEC is seeking to understand how registrants — whether online brokerages, robo-advisers, internet investment advisers,...  The Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) recently issued a request for information and public comment on the use of new and emerging technologies by investment advisers and broker-dealers that suggests potential regulatory action to come.[1] According to its release, the SEC is seeking to understand how registrants — whether online brokerages, robo-advisers, internet investment advisers, or more traditionally-operated firms — use various digital engagement practices, interactive websites and mobile applications, or artificial intelligence to serve retail investors.  Through this request, the SEC is scrutinizing how these technological developments help firms engage with their customers and give them access to the securities markets as well as challenge those firms’ ability to comply with their regulatory obligations. To that end, the request includes over 90 numbered questions and the SEC’s current observations about registrants’ adoption of financial technology (“Fintech”). For example, the release notes that, while certain digital engagement practices (or “DEPs” as coined by the SEC) may help democratize retail investing, they may also lead to investment activity that is inconsistent with a retail customer’s goals or risk tolerance through targeted advertising or dark patterns (which also has been a recent focus of the Federal Trade Commission[2]). SEC Chair Gary Gensler underscored this risk and the need to protect against potential conflicts of interest, stating: “While these new technologies can bring us greater access and product choice, they also raise questions as to whether we as investors are appropriately protected when we trade and get financial advice.” [3] The release also notes that the use of Fintech may present firms with new — and perhaps unanticipated — challenges to their data privacy, cybersecurity, and standard of conduct obligations.  Significantly, the release announces the SEC’s intention to “assess[] … existing regulations and consider[] … whether regulatory action may be needed” to address the industry’s increasing adoption of these technological developments. Any firm employing any of the following Fintech practices should carefully consider how this regulatory scrutiny could challenge their operations and take the opportunity, as requested by the SEC, to help the Commission understand the benefits of employing emerging technologies for retail investors.  Predictive data analytics, artificial intelligence, or machine learning  Social networking tools  Games, streaks, and other contests with prizes  Points, badges, and leaderboards  Text or app notifications  Celebrations for trading  Visual cues on user interfaces  Ideas presented at order placement and other curated lists or features  Subscription and membership tiers  Chatbots  The public comment period ends on October 1, 2021. BakerHostetler’s Securities Enforcement Defense, Digital Assets and Data Management, Investment Funds, and Financial Services teams are comprised of partners who have served in the SEC’s Enforcement Division and the SEC’s Office of the General Counsel as well as attorneys with extensive Fintech experience who can help investment advisers and broker-dealers understand what this release means to their business and participate in the public comment process.

By Sonya Sellmeyer, Consumer Advocacy Officer for the Iowa Insurance Division  September is Life Insurance Awareness Month and there is no better time than the present to secure your family’s financial future. According to the Life Insurance Marketing and Research Association (LIMRA), only 31% of consumers say they are very or extremely knowledgeable about life insurance. Since insurance is complicated, the Iowa Insurance Division has developed the Save4Later website to help Iowans plan, earn, save, and retire by learning the basics of financial literacy and insurance concepts.  Life insurance pays a death benefit when you die to your named beneficiaries. Life insurance can be a safety net to avoid challenging times if a loved one who contributed earnings to a household passes away unexpectedly. You may use the payout to help cover funeral expenses, mortgage payments or rent, daily living expenses, college tuition, outstanding loans, and uncovered medical bills. It may also help preserve generational wealth. You may pick more than one beneficiary with different percentage payouts, or you may even designate a charity or church to receive the benefits. You will also pick a contingent beneficiary just in case the primary beneficiary has passed when the policy is paid out.  According to LIMRA 60 million families don’t have adequate coverage and 59% of uninsured consumers say they need life insurance. Speaking with a licensed life insurance agent will assist you in determining the correct type and amount of coverage that is best for you and your financial situation. There are two main classes of life insurance coverage: term and cash value. As the name states, term insurance provides coverage for a period of time and is usually very affordable. Cash-value life insurance protects you for as long as you pay the premiums. After receiving the policy, always review it and ensure you understand all the terms and conditions. You have a 10 day free look period on the policy where you can return it to the insurer and receive a refund. If the new policy is a replacement for an existing life policy, you have 30 days to review the policy. Also, do periodic reviews of all your insurance policies to ensure the amounts and terms still fit within your financial plan.  Women are less likely to own life insurance with only 47% of women owning life insurance compared to 58% of men according to LIMRA, and only 22% of women feel very knowledgeable about life insurance. The Iowa Insurance Division has created SmartHER Money, a free resource available to educate and empower women about their finances.  Caregivers commonly come across old life insurance policies in the possessions of a loved one. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners has a life insurance policy locator which is free and can assist with finding long-lost life insurance policies of your deceased family member or loved one.  Learning about the role of life insurance in your financial plan is essential for protecting your family’s financial future."

Freedom of Information Act,Georgia's Witch Hunt: Who Helped the Feds Fight Our Voting Laws?,Memeorandum | Political news,Memeorandum,"Georgia's Witch Hunt: Who Helped the Feds Fight Our Voting Laws?  Jose Pagliery / The Daily Beast:  Georgia’s secretary of state is on a quest to find evidence that the Department of Justice colluded with voter-advocacy groups to fight the state’s new voting restrictions.  The U.S. Justice Department has set its sights on Georgia’s new voter restrictions, filing a lawsuit in June challenging a number of the state’s recent changes. And Georgia’s top elections official is not taking the challenge kindly.  Brad Raffensperger, Georgia’s now-infamous secretary of state, is on a quest to find evidence that federal government lawyers colluded with voter advocacy groups—whether that evidence exists or not.  Raffensperger is using the Freedom of Information Act, a sunshine law commonly used by journalists to obtain government documents and expose otherwise secret activity, to seek communications between the DOJ and voting rights groups.  The Republican secretary of state told The Daily Beast on Wednesday that he wants to know if the DOJ is “bowing to pressure” from “liberal activist organizations” that had previously come out against the law, including the anti-discrimination Southern Poverty Law Center, Latino Community Fund Georgia, Asian Americans Advancing Justice, the disability advocacy group ADAPT, the Georgia Muslim Voter Project, and several Black churches and clergy groups.  “We want to find out exactly: Are they listening to these outside organizations? Are they taking their orders from high command—which is actually Stacey Abrams and these liberal activist organizations,” he said. “Or are there actual liberal activists in the Department of Justice spinning these lawsuits out of whole cloth?”  These groups sued to block the state’s controversial SB 202 law in May, and the DOJ followed suit the very next month with a petition that claims the law “was enacted with the purpose of denying or abridging the right of Black Georgians to vote on account of their race or color.”  Raffensperger finds the united front against the law suspicious. His FOIA request letter, dated Aug. 31, demands “all communications” between the DOJ and 62 different nonprofits, lawyers, and activists. The last person named on that list is the person largely considered Raffensperger’s local archenemy: Abrams, a Democratic politician there who turned her failed run for governor into a voter registration blitzkrieg that defied odds and turned the red state blue.  In an interview with The Daily Beast, Raffensperger declined to say what he’d consider a smoking gun to prove his collusion charges, but he said that when all the information comes out, “then you’ll have an open and transparent opportunity for the American public to see who’s running the DOJ and where this is all coming from.”  While Raffensperger’s FOIA requests may seem targeted at undermining the DOJ’s legal case, they also might have a political motivation. Raffensperger became a target for conservatives and then-President Donald Trump during the former president’s efforts to overturn the election, and already, the Republican secretary of state is drawing some familiar criticism from liberal voting rights groups.  “The list of organizations he’s targeting are full of Black and brown civil rights organizations, an Indigenous tribe, and Black churches. Accusations like these spikes death threats, and Brad knows this,” tweeted Hillary Holley, the organizing director for Fair Fight Action, the voter registration group Abrams started.  “He knows there are no witches,” said Marilyn R. Marks, the executive director at Coalition for Good Governance, one of the nonprofits mentioned in the FOIA. “We haven’t been to the DOJ. We don’t have any correspondence with the DOJ.”  Marks’ group is currently involved in two separate lawsuits against Raffensperger and his agency. One seeks to replace the state’s current voting machines, which its hired cybersecurity experts have warned are insecure and vulnerable to hackers, and the other petition is an attempt to stop SB 202, which Marks said unfairly restricts Georgians from publicly exposing problems with local elections.  “If we see election fraud or big mistakes or violations of law, Secretary Raffensperger’s SB 202 makes it a crime for us to report violations of law enforcement,” she said, warning that the law as written would also prevent journalists observing elections from publicly reporting any mishandling of ballots that they witness.  Raffensperger told The Daily Beast he isn’t sure what internal DOJ communications will reveal, but he hopes to better understand why Georgia is “being continually targeted” by the federal agency for laws that already exist in other states. For example, Minnesota requests identification to receive an absentee ballot, and New York prohibits handing out food and drinks to voters in line. Both measures were put in place with Georgia’s new law.  “The Department of Justice has taken the position that it’s OK for some states to do what they’re doing, but in Georgia you can’t do that. That’ s a patently ridiculous position,” he said. “Why are we held to a different standard?”  The Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which was co-founded by civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr., is also among the organizations listed by the Georgia Secretary of State’s Office. SCLC President Charles Steele Jr. told The Daily Beast that he has not been in communication with the Justice Department, but he said he supports its battle against what he called a “racist law against those who've been disenfranchised for many years.”  The most plain example, he said, is how the law reduces the number of absentee ballot drop boxes that were placed on government property under video surveillance—something that was originally a temporary measure of additional access provided to reduce voter exposure to coronavirus.  “People really like the availability of that. The drop-off boxes really give people who’ve been disenfranchised a good feeling that they don’t have to be judged or overly intimidated by going to a court-type environment to vote. I can just drive up as an American and drop it off in my ballot box in my district,” he said. “They’re trying to disenfranchise people… they’re trying to make it difficult.”  Steele said the current fight against state elections officials is merely the latest phase in the long-running battle over voting rights—one that was worsened when the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act in 2013. That’s when it allowed states with a history of discrimination against Blacks to change voter laws without first getting federal government approval.  “The state government has always been our enemy, and the federal government has always been our friend. Racism, segregation, Jim Crow. It’s always been the state government that fought us,” he said.  Raffensperger rejects any notion that the new law is “Jim Crow 2.0,” as Abrams has labeled it. And he compared her ongoing campaign against his policies to the incessant barrage of conspiracy theories spewed by Trump during the state’s presidential election recount last year.  “We’ve been fighting Stacey Abrams since 2018 and her voter suppression narrative. In 2020, we were fighting the narrative of voter fraud. In Georgia, it’s never been easier to register. It’s never been easier to vote.”"
Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II,Introducing IFD / IFR: A New Prudential Regime For Investment Firms,Mondaq | Employment and HR | Asia Pacific,Mondaq,"Introducing IFD / IFR: A New Prudential Regime For Investment Firms  From 26 June 2021, a new prudential regime applies to investment firms authorised under the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (""MiFID II"").  To print this article, all you need is to be registered or login on Mondaq.com.   From 26 June 2021, a new prudential regime applies to investment firms authorised under the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (""MiFID II"").  This new framework, set out in the Investment Firm Regulation (""IFR"") and the Investment Firm Directive (""IFD""), significantly revises the prudential rulebook for investment firms by introducing a bespoke regime.  Underpinned by the principles of risk relevance and proportionality, the new regime applies a range of rules relating to capital requirements, financial and regulatory reporting, internal governance and remuneration to investment firms, depending on their classification across a risk spectrum.  Classification of Investment Firms  Depending on size, scale and activities, investment firms fall into one of three categories under the IFD / IFR regime: Class 1; Class 2 and Class 3.  Class 1 firms are systemically important firms that are authorised to deal on their own account or underwrite or place financial instruments on a firm commitment basis and whose total assets exceed €30 billion (individually or on a group basis).  These firms are subject to European Central Bank supervision and must now apply for authorisation as a credit institution. Until the new licence is issued, they remain subject to the Capital Requirements Directive (""CRD"") and the Capital Requirements Regulation (""CRR"") capital and remuneration requirements that applied prior to 26 June 2021.  Class 1 minus firms are investment firms authorised to deal on their own account or underwrite or place financial instruments on a firm commitment basis and whose total value of consolidated assets exceeds €15 billion but does not meet the €30 billion Class 1 threshold.  These firms continue to be regulated under CRD / CRR and remain subject to CRD / CRR capital and remuneration requirements.  Class 2 firms are investment firms that are not systemically important and which exceed certain size and risk thresholds.  This is expected to be the default category for many investment firms.  Class 2 firms are subject to IFD / IFR supervisory and remuneration requirements (unless part of a group that is subject to consolidated supervision under the CRD / CRR).  Class 2 firms are required to hold minimum own funds based on the higher of their fixed overhead requirement (""FOR""), their permanent minimum capital (""PMC"") requirement or a new 'K-factor' own funds requirement.  The K-factors are a set of metrics used to determine the capital requirements for a firm, depending on the range and extent of services the firm provides.  Class 3 firms are small and non-interconnected firms which do not meet certain thresholds. These are subject to reduced and modified IFD / IFR requirements (unless part of a group that is subject to consolidated supervision under CRD / CRR requirements).  Class 3 firms are required to hold minimum own funds based on the higher of their FOR requirement or their PMC.  They are not required to calculate their capital based on the K-factor methodology but still need to calculate K-factors for categorisation purposes.  Class 3 firms continue to be subject to the MiFID remuneration requirements and not the IFD / IFR remuneration framework.  Remuneration  The IFD / IFR introduce remuneration requirements including deferral, payment in instruments and remuneration committees for many investment firms. Consistent with the principle of proportionality, the governance and remuneration requirements will depend on a firm's classification and balance sheet size.  The Central Bank of Ireland (""Central Bank"") intends to issue an 'Implementation of NCA Discretions in IFD / IFR Regulatory Notice' in due course to set out how it will exercise the Member State remuneration related discretions to be granted to it by the Irish Minister of Finance.  National Implementation: Ireland  IFR and IFD entered into force on 25 December 2019. IFR is directly effective from 26 June 2021 and EU Member States are expected to apply domestic legislation implementing IFD from 26 June 2021.  The Irish Department of Finance issued a Feedback Statement on 24 May 2021 on the outcome of its public consultation on the national discretions under IFD in May 2020. For further details see our client update Ireland Exercises National Discretions under IFD / IFR.  Irish-implementing legislation is expected shortly.  On 23 June 2021, the Central Bank issued a Feedback Statement providing further guidance on how it will exercise competent authority discretions in the IFR and IFD.  Noting that the transposition into Irish law of IFD Articles 60 and 61 will amend own funds requirements for AIFMs and UCITS management companies with MiFID II top-up permissions, the Central Bank has clarified that such entities should continue to comply with the current prudential regime specified in their conditions of authorisation pending further Central Bank engagement.  What should investment firms do?  To ensure compliance with the IFD / IFR regime, investment firms should familiarise themselves with the IFD / IFR requirements and the potential impact on their business.  This may involve the following initial considerations:  Assessment of the firm in the context of Class 1 / 2 / 3 categorisation  Review of the applicable minimum capital requirements  Revision of the firm's remuneration policies and procedures / framework  Preparing for the new regulatory reporting regime that the firm is subject to  Any gaps identified in the current business model should be remediated and policies and procedures should be updated to ensure compliance.  In January 2021, the Central Bank indicated that investment firms' preparation for the IFD / IFR should be discussed at board level.  A Central Bank statement on 14 July 2021 reminded relevant firms to engage with the European Banking Authority data collection exercise (as part of its second consultation on the draft RTS on the calculation of the threshold in Article 8a(1) of CRD) as communicated to them by their supervisory team and to confirm their IFD / IFR classification to that team by the end of August 2021.  How Maples Can Help  Our dedicated Irish Financial Services Regulatory Group is currently working with a number of firms implementing the new regime, including: reviewing remuneration framework and employment terms; engaging with the Central Bank; assessing re-categorisation of firms and relevant thresholds (particularly within group contexts); advising clients on interpreting key provisions; and how the Department of Finance and the Central Bank intend to exercise national discretions.  The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter. Specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances."

Equal Credit Opportunity Act,CFPB Proposes Data Collection and Reporting for Small Business Lenders,Lexology | United States Company & Commercial,Lexology,"Donald Maurice  CFPB Proposes Data Collection and Reporting for Small Business Lenders  Contributor: Maurice Wutscher LLP  Summary: ...The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has proposed a rule it says would “shine new light on small businesses’ access to credit.” The proposed rule accomplishes this goal by requiring lenders...  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has proposed a rule it says would “shine new light on small businesses’ access to credit.” The proposed rule accomplishes this goal by requiring lenders to “disclose information about their lending to small businesses.”  Titled “Small Business Lending Data Collection under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act,” the proposed rule is intended to encompass not only traditional small business lenders, but also fintech lenders and merchant cash advance lenders (MCAs) that cater to small businesses.  The proposed rule would amend Regulation B of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and can be found here. A summary of the proposed rule prepared by the Bureau is available here.  At 918 pages, the CFPB not only provides the proposed rule, but also substantial background material to aid in interpreting the proposal.  Covered Lenders and Excluded Transactions  “Covered financial institutions” are “any partnership, company, corporation, association (incorporated or unincorporated), trust, estate, cooperative organization, or other entity that engages in any financial activity” and “that originated at least 25 covered credit transactions for small businesses in each of the two preceding calendar years.” It is a broad group of entities and, as the Bureau puts it, “the rule would apply to a variety of entities that engage in small business lending.” This would include both depository and non-depository lenders such as motor vehicle and equipment lenders, online lenders, platform lenders, commercial finance companies, as well as governmental and nonprofit lenders.  The proposed rule excludes leases, factoring and “consumer-designated” credit, being credit that is offered or extended primarily for personal, family or household use. It also excludes credit secured by “1-4 individual dwelling units that the applicant (or one or more of the applicant’s principal owners) does not, or will not, occupy.” Finally, the proposed rule would exclude trade credit, and provides as an example “a supplier that finances the sale of equipment, supplies, or inventory.”  Data Collection and Reporting  The proposed rule would impose data collection and reporting requirements for “covered applications from small businesses for covered credit transactions.” As proposed, covered financial institutions would be required to:  collect and report whether an applicant is a minority-owned business or women-owned business.  when it requests an applicant provide minority-owned or women-owned business status, inform the applicant that the financial institution cannot discriminate on the basis of the applicant’s minority- or women-owned business status, or on whether the applicant provides this information.  inform an applicant that the applicant is not required to respond to the financial institution’s questions regarding the applicant’s minority-owned business status and women-owned business status.  In addition, the proposed rule  prohibits covered financial institutions from requiring applicants to provide minority- or women-owned status information.  includes a sample data collection form.  permits the reporting of minority- and women-owned status from previously collected data if the financial institution is permitted to do so under proposed § 1002.107(c)(2) and its commentary.  permits a financial institution to “collect and report a principal owner’s ethnicity and race based on visual observation and/or surname in certain circumstances.” However, the same exception is not permitted for collection of women-owned status. Financial institutions are required to “collect at least one principal owner’s race and ethnicity (but not sex) on the basis of visual observation and/or surname when the applicant does not provide ethnicity, race or sex information for at least one principal owner.”  The proposed rule imposes further extensive requirements for the means and manner by which information is collected and reported.  Unique Definition of “Small Business”  The proposed rule defines a small business using the definitions for “business concern” and “small business concern” in the federal Small Business Act and regulations promulgated by the Small Business Administration regulations. However, under the proposed rule, notwithstanding a business’s size (i.e., number of employees) a business is a small business “if and only if its gross annual revenue, as defined in [the proposed rule], for its preceding fiscal year is $5 million or less.” This is substantially less than the annual gross revenue for a small business classification by the SBA.  Comments on the proposed rule will be accepted by the Bureau on or before 90 days from the publication of the proposed rule in the federal register."

The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate that   cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted against The Kraft Heinz Co.   (“KHC”) and against Eduardo Pelleissone (“Pelleissone”), pursuant to Section 8A of the   Securities Act and Section 21C of the Exchange Act.   II.   In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, KHC and Pelleissone (collectively   “Respondents”) have submitted Offers of Settlement (the “Offers”) which the Commission has   determined to accept. Solely for the purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings   brought by or on behalf of the Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without   admitting or denying the findings herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over them and   the subject matter of these proceedings, which are admitted, and except as provided herein in   Section V, Respondents consent to the entry of this Order Instituting Cease-And-Desist   Proceedings Pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act and Section 21C of the Exchange Act,   Making Findings and Imposing a Cease-And-Desist Order (“Order”), as set forth below.   In the Matter of   THE KRAFT HEINZ CO.,   and   EDUARDO PELLEISSONE,      Respondents.   2   III.   On the basis of this Order and Respondents’ Offers, the Commission finds  1    that:   Summary   1.  This matter concerns a multi-year expense management scheme by KHC’s   procurement division to improperly reduce KHC’s cost of goods sold and achieve cost savings that   were externally touted to the market and internally tied to performance-based targets. The   misconduct resulted in KHC reporting inflated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and   amortization (“EBITDA”), a key performance metric for investors.  From the fourth quarter of   2015 through the end of 2018 (the “Relevant Period”), procurement employees negotiated   agreements with numerous suppliers to obtain upfront cash payments and discounts, in exchange   for future commitments to be undertaken by KHC, while improperly documenting the agreements   in ways that caused the company to prematurely and improperly recognize the expense savings.   2.  In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States   (“Generally Accepted Accounting Principles” or “U.S. GAAP”), if the upfront cash and   discounts are tied to future commitments, then the expense savings must be recognized over the   period the future obligations are satisfied. Procurement division employees, however, negotiated   and maintained false and misleading supplier contracts that made it appear as if expense savings   were provided in exchange for past or same-year events performed by KHC, when, in reality,   they were upfront payments in exchange for a future benefit from KHC, in order to improperly   recognize costs savings prematurely.   3.  Over the Relevant Period, KHC entered into approximately 59 transactions which   were improperly recognized as a result of the false and misleading documentation negotiated and   generated by procurement division employees. Had these transactions been properly documented   and accounted for, KHC’s cost of goods sold during that period would have been approximately   $50 million higher than reported.   4.  These misleading transactions, along with numerous other misstated accounting   entries, led KHC, in June 2019, to restate its financial statements on Form 10-K. The restatement   included financial data reported for fiscal year (“FY”) 2015, as well as the financial statements   contained in Forms 10-Q and 10-K for FYs 2016 and 2017 and the first three quarters of FY 2018   that were filed with the Commission. KHC corrected a total of $208 million in cost savings   arising from 295 transactions, and also corrected its Adjusted EBITDA during the relevant   period, as reflected in the restatement.   5.  Pelleissone, KHC’s then Chief Operating Officer and Global Head of Operations,   was presented with several warning signs indicating that expenses were being managed through   manipulating supplier agreements, imposed pressures on the procurement division to deliver   unrealistic savings targets, and, as a member of the company’s disclosure committee,   1    The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondents’ Offers of Settlement and are not binding on any other person   or entity in this or any other proceeding.   3   unreasonably approved KHC financial statements that he should have known were materially false   and misleading.   6.  A procurement executive who reported to Pelleissone (“Procurement Executive”),   managed the procurement division, approved certain of KHC contracts with suppliers, and had   sub-certification responsibilities in 2018. Despite numerous warning signs that should have   alerted him that procurement division employees were circumventing KHC’s internal controls in   order to achieve cost savings targets, the Procurement Executive approved and failed to prevent   several supplier contracts that masked the true nature of the underlying transactions. The   Procurement Executive also should have known that this false and misleading contract   documentation was provided to KHC’s finance and controller groups, thus causing KHC to   prematurely recognize cost savings in contravention of U.S. GAAP.   RESPONDENTS   7.  KHC is a food and beverage manufacturing company co-headquartered in   Chicago, Illinois, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The company has a class of shares registered   with the Commission pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(b), which trades on NASDAQ under   the symbol “KHC.” KHC was created in July 2015 through the merger of public company Kraft   Foods Group Inc. (“Kraft”) with and into private company H.J. Heinz Co. (“Heinz”).   8.  Pelleissone, age 47, resides in Chicago, Illinois. Pelleissone was KHC’s Global   Head of Operations and Chief Operating Officer between July 2015 and November 2018, and its   Head of Strategic Projects from November 2018 until June 2019, when he left the company.   During the period of 2016 through 2018, Pelleissone served as a member of KHC’s disclosure   committee, which was tasked with reviewing and affirming the accuracy and completeness of the   company’s quarterly and annual filings.  Before the merger with Kraft, Pelleissone was the   Global Head of Operations for Heinz. Pelleissone is currently the president of operations in a   regional subsidiary of a different publicly traded company.   FACTS   Background   9.  Following the Kraft-Heinz merger in July 2015, newly-formed KHC made   concerted efforts to eliminate redundancies and reduce operational costs. As part of its merger   strategy, KHC disclosed to investors that the company would deliver on certain cost savings   results throughout the company, including in the procurement division, a large cost center for   KHC. The cost savings strategy, including its impact on costs of goods sold, was widely covered   by analysts at the time. Although the company achieved the promised cost savings, individual   procurement employees had key performance targets tied to additional cost savings from the   procurement division.   10.  To implement this cost savings strategy, the company set performance targets for   procurement division employees tied to savings realized through negotiations with suppliers.   For a period immediately following the merger between Kraft and Heinz, these targets were   4   generally achieved, due to, among other things, synergies from renegotiating supplier contracts   in light of the newly-combined company’s increased purchasing power.   11.  By 2017, however, the procurement division had largely exhausted its ability to   extract synergies from the merger. In addition, the cost of many ingredient and packaging   supplies increased significantly due to adverse inflation and unfavorable foreign exchange rates.   12.  The combined impact of the increased raw material costs and savings already   realized in prior years made it more difficult for procurement division employees to achieve   additional, incremental savings in 2017 and 2018. The procurement division, under the   Procurement Executive’s direction and with Pelleissone’s oversight, implemented overly   ambitious annual budget and division-level savings targets, based on corporate KHC targets.   They, in turn, pushed procurement division employees to come up with ideas to generate   additional immediate, same-year, savings, and did not adjust the internal targets.   Expense Management Misconduct   13.  The expense management misconduct was carried out by KHC’s procurement   division employees, across multiple geographic zones, and involved several strategies employed to   misrepresent the true nature of transactions, resulting in accounting errors and misstatements. Out   of the 295 transactions that KHC ultimately corrected in connection with the restatement,   approximately 59 were part of the procurement division’s expense management misconduct,   including the following types of transactions:     “  Prebate Transactions” – KHC procurement division employees agreed to future-   year commitments, like contract extensions and future-year volume purchases, in   exchange for savings discounts and credits by suppliers (“Prebates”), but   mischaracterized the savings in contract documentation, which stated that they   were for   past or same-year   purchases made by KHC (“Rebates”);     “  Clawback Transactions” – KHC procurement division employees agreed to take   upfront payments subject to repayment through future price increases or volume   commitments, but documented the transaction in ways which obscured the   repayment obligation; and     “  Price Phasing Transactions” – Suppliers agreed to reduce their prices during a   certain period in exchange for an offsetting price increase in a future period, but   the full nature of the arrangement was not communicated by KHC procurement   division employees to KHC controller group employees.   14.  In accordance with U.S. GAAP,  2     KHC should have recognized the savings   2    GAAP requires that a “rebate or refund of a specified amount of cash consideration that is payable pursuant to a   binding arrangement only if the entity completes a specified cumulative level of purchases or remains a customer   for a specified time period shall be recognized as a reduction of the cost of sales based on a systematic and rational   5   provided in exchange for future commitments over the period of time that KHC performed the   commitments. Accordingly, when a prebate was provided in exchange for a contract extension   or future-year volume commitment, the savings should have been recognized over the life of the   extension, or the future period in which KHC purchased the goods from the supplier.   Conversely, rebate savings from past or same-year commitments should have been recognized   ratably over the period in which they were earned. Finally, clawback transactions should have   been recognized ratably over the clawback period—when it was reasonably estimable that KHC   would satisfy its repayment obligation.   2014-2015:  Early Expense Management Misconduct   15.  In the months leading up to the merger with Kraft, the procurement division of   Heinz was faced with a $10 million year-end cost savings gap.  This gap created pressure for the   division to come up with ideas to generate additional same-year savings. As a result, the   Procurement Executive, who worked at Heinz at the time, took steps with regard to a previously-   negotiated transaction with a packaging supplier to improperly recognize additional cost savings   in 2015.  Pelleissone received monthly performance reports of these negotiations.   16.  The original agreement, which the Procurement Executive signed the year earlier   on behalf of Heinz, provided that the supplier would make a $3.5 million upfront payment   (commonly referred to as a “prebate”) to Heinz in exchange for the parties’ signing a new three-   year contract in 2015. The letter of intent further stated that the supplier was   not   obligated to   provide the $3.5 million prebate payment if the parties failed to execute the new contract.   Consistent with this contract language, the Procurement Executive delivered a presentation to   Pelleissone which communicated that the cost savings from the $3.5 million prebate transaction   was linked to the three-year period covered by the new contract.   17.  In late 2015, following the merger, KHC renegotiated the language describing the   $3.5 million prebate, entered into a new contract which stated the payment was “a non-refundable   2015 payment . . . for purchases made in 2015,” and prematurely recognized the cost savings in   2015.   18.  This accounting treatment was improper because the final contract, which the   Procurement Executive approved and signed, mischaracterized the true nature of the supplier   payment by concealing the fact that the $3.5 million prebate payment remained linked to a three-   year contract.   19.  Planning documents that the Procurement Executive presented to Pelleissone   acknowledged that Heinz was in the process of negotiating a new supplier contract for the   purpose of generating “improved, backdated impact for CY15” in the form of a “rebate.”  The   allocation of the cash consideration offered to each of the underlying transactions that results in progress by the   entity toward earning the rebate or refund provided the amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. If   the rebate or refund is not probable and cannot be reasonably estimated, it shall be recognized as the milestones are   achieved.” Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 705-20   Accounting for Certain Consideration Received   from a Vendor.   6   document stated that the parties needed to “align on wording,” without which, the company   could “book only 1/3 of benefit” in 2015. The Procurement Executive also met with the CEO of   the supplier in order to determine if the supplier would be “open to reword” the description of   the payment to “allow [Heinz] to book” the full “3,5 Mi[llio]n USD into 2015”, and discussed   internally that wording of the $3.5 million payment would enable Heinz to book the amount in   2015. Finally, Pelleissone and the Procurement Executive understood that a final board   presentation regarding procurement, unlike prior drafts, did not contain the details surrounding   the $3.5 million prebate payment from the supplier.   20.  In a separate transaction involving the same supplier, the Procurement Executive   and Pelleissone discussed the restructuring of a $2 million retention bonus that the supplier had   awarded to legacy Kraft before the merger, in order for newly merged KHC to recognize the full   amount in 2015, resulting in a credit to the savings targets of Heinz procurement personnel. The   Procurement Executive and Pelleissone had access to information that was not communicated to   the controller group that would have caused the controller group to question whether immediate   recognition of the $2 "
Employee Retirement Income Security Act,Former Fiduciary Sanctioned Over Illegal Transaction,PLANSPONSOR | Latest News,PLANSPONSOR,"John Manganaro  Former Fiduciary Sanctioned Over Illegal Transaction  The Department of Labor says the fiduciary diverted tens of millions of dollars in plan assets for their own personal benefit through a variety of illegal transactions.  The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) has obtained a final order in a Pennsylvania federal court and concluded its 18-year legal pursuit against a disbarred attorney and former benefits plan fiduciary.  The order sanctions John J. Koresko V, of Bridgeport, Pennsylvania. It is the result of a legal proceeding with roots stretching all the way back to 2003, when the DOL’s Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) Philadelphia Regional Office began an investigation of Koresko, along with the Regional Employers’ Assurance Leagues Voluntary Employees’ Beneficiary Association Trust and other affiliated companies.  The agency found that Koresko and others had diverted tens of millions of dollars in plan assets for their personal benefit through a variety of illegal transactions. The DOL says the money was used to purchase personal property on the Caribbean island of Nevis and in South Carolina, and for boat rentals and other improper personal uses.  On August 19, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania issued a final order closing the case, at which time it added nearly $4 million to costs previously assessed against Koresko, resulting in a judgment of more than $42 million against Koresko and his companies. In total, the DOL obtained distributions to the affected plans of $68 million.  The EBSA says that from the start of its investigation, Koresko refused to cooperate and the department sought court orders to enforce subpoenas it issued. The court later found Koresko in contempt.  With one exception, the court found the defendants liable for almost $20 million in restitution for losses and disgorgement of profits. The court also permanently removed and barred the defendants from serving as fiduciaries to any Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA)-covered plan.  In later proceedings, the court imprisoned Koresko for more than two years after finding him in civil contempt for not complying with the order to disgorge his profits back to the plans.  “The plans’ participants suffered much harm due to the defendants’ action,” says EBSA Philadelphia Regional Director Michael Schloss. “The conclusion of the litigation provides those participants with relief and demonstrates the U.S. Department of Labor’s commitment to ensuring that employers take seriously their responsibility to provide benefits to their employees and their beneficiaries.”"

They are based on   hypothetical   values and show   hypothetical   returns on the Notes. The examples and table  illustrate payments on the Notes based on a hypothetical Starting Value of 100 for the Least Performing Underlying, a hypothetical Call Value of 95 for the Least Performing Underlying, a  hypothetical Threshold Value of 70 for the Least Performing Underlying, Call Amounts as indicated on page PS-4, the Redemption Amount of $1,252.00 per $1,000 in principal amount of  Notes if the Ending Value of the Least Performing Underlying is greater than or equal to its Starting Value and a range of hypothetical Observation Values and Ending Values for the Least  Performing Underlying.   The actual amount you receive and the resulting return will depend on the actual Starting Values, Call Values, Threshold Values, Observation Values and  Ending Values of the Underlyings, whether the Notes are automatically called prior to maturity, and whether you hold the Notes to maturity.   The following examples do not take  into account any tax consequences from investing in the Notes.  For recent actual levels of the Underlyings, see “The Underlyings” section below. Each Underlying is a price return index and as such its Observation Values and Ending Value will not  include any income generated by dividends paid on the stocks included in that Underlying, which you would otherwise be entitled to receive if you invested in those stocks directly. In  addition, all payments on the Notes are subject to Issuer and Guarantor credit risk.  If Notes Are Called on an Observation Date  The Notes will be called at an amount equal to the applicable Call Amount if on any Observation Date the Observation Value of each Underlying is greater than or equal to its Call Value.  After the Notes are called, they will no longer remain outstanding and there will not be any further payments on the Notes.  Example 1 - The Observation Value of each Underlying on the first Observation Date is 112.00. Therefore, the Notes will be called at $1,084.00 per $1,000 in principal amount of Notes.  Example 2 - The Observation Value of each Underlying on the first three Observation Dates is below its Call Value, but the Observation Value of each Underlying on the  fourth Observation Date is 130.00. Therefore, the Notes will be called at $1,210.00 per $1,000 in principal amount of Notes.

Privacy Regulations,Lyft and Uber will cover legal fees of drivers sued under Texas abortion law,Engadget | All Posts,Engadget,"Lyft and Uber will cover legal fees of drivers sued under Texas abortion law  Lyft will cover the legal fees of drivers sued under the state of Texas’ recently enacted SB8 abortion law, the company announced on Friday. The law prohibits women from terminating a pregnancy after six weeks. That’s a time frame before most even know they’re pregnant. Critically, SB8 also allows private citizens to sue anyone who assists a pregnant woman trying to skirt the ban, including rideshare drivers who face the prospect of $10,000 fines. “This law is incompatible with people’s basic rights to privacy, our community guidelines, the spirit of rideshare and our values as a company,” Lyft said in a blog post. In response to SB8, the company is establishing a legal defense fund it says will cover 100 percent of the legal fees incurred by its drivers. It’s also donating $1 million to Planned Parenthood.

As a result of the June 17 amendment, Saturday, June 19 became a non-business day with respect to certain specific timing provisions in Regulation Z. On August 12, 2021, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued an interpretive rule providing guidance on the impacts of the new holiday on the definition of “business day” in certain Regulation Z timing requirements related to rescission of closed-end mortgages and the TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosures (TRID).2  Recognizing the need for time to implement the guidance due to the new federal holiday and each supervised institution to achieve effective compliance, the Federal Reserve does not intend to cite a violation in an examination or initiate an enforcement action due to compliance issues that arose out of the implementation period for the new federal holiday.

Freedom of Information Act,Afghanistan: esce in Italia la storia segreta della guerra,ANSA.it | Top News,ANSA,"Afghanistan: esce in Italia la storia segreta della guerra  con Newton Compton in libreria Dossier WP su 20 anni di scandali  (di Alessandra Baldini) (ANSA) - NEW YORK, 04 SET - ll presidente George W. Bush non conosceva il nome del suo comandante in Afghanistan e non voleva trovare il tempo per incontrarlo. Il capo del Pentagono Donald Rumsfeld, per sua stessa ammissione, non aveva ""alcuna visione su chi erano i cattivi"". Queste e altre rivelazioni scottanti sulla scia del disastroso ritiro americano dall'Afghanistan arrivano anche in Italia. ""The Afghanistan Papers"" del giornalista investigativo del Washington Post Craig Whitlock sara' pubblicato il 30 settembre da Newton Compton col titolo ""Dossier Afghanistan. La storia segreta della guerra"". Il libro e' uscito negli Usa il 31 agosto ed ha subito suscitato polemiche perche' mette sul banco degli imputati tre presidenti - oltre Bush anche Barack Obama e Donald Trump - e i vertici militari e dell'intelligence. Whitlock, tre volte finalista ai Pulitzer, racconta una storia sconcertante per i paralleli con la guerra del Vietnam tanto che gli ""Afghanistan Papers"" sono stati subito paragonati ai Pentagon Papers che Washington Post e New York Times ottennero dalla talpa Daniel Ellsberg e che servirono a sbugiardare la versione rosea del Pentagono sull'andamento del conflitto nelle giungle di Indocina. Cosi' come i 'Pentagon Papers' cambiarono la percezione del Vietnam da parte del pubblico, il ""Dossier Afganistan"" contiene rivelazioni sorprendenti ddi centinaia di insider che hanno avuto un ruolo diretto nella guerra. vengono cosi' a galla le bugie utilizzate per giustificare un conflitto senza fine. Dal 2001 oltre 775 mila militari Usa sono stati impiegati in Afghanistan, molti ripetutamente. Di questi 2.300 sono morti e oltre 20 mila sono rimasti feriti.  Il racconto di ""Dossier Afghanistan"" si basa su documenti top secret e interviste con centinaia di persone che sapevano che il governo degli Stati Uniti stava presentando una versione distorta, e talvolta completamente inventata, dei fatti. I documenti erano frutto di un progetto federale commissionato per capire le cause del falimento della piu' lunga guerra della storia americana. ""Parlavano francamente perche' pensavano che le loro dichiarazioni non sarebbero mai diventate pubbliche"", spiega Whitlock che ha impiegato tre anni per ottenere il materiale usando il Freedom of Information Act. A differenza del Vietnam e dell'Iraq, l'invasione americana dell'Afghanistan dopo l'11 settembre 2001 ebbe inizialmente sostegno quasi unanime da parte dell'opinione pubblica.  All'inizio, gli obiettivi erano chiari: sconfiggere al-Qaeda e prevenire il ripetersi di attacchi terroristici. Tuttavia, dopo soli due anni e dopo la rimozione dei Talebani dal potere, la missione prese un'altra strada, lasciando l'esercito americano impantanato in un conflitto di guerriglia impossibile da vincere. Nessun presidente volle ammettere il fallimento: al contrario, Bush, Obama e Trump continuarono a inviare truppe affermando che si stavano facendo progressi pur sapendo che non c'erano prospettive realistiche di vittoria.

Investment Advisers Act of 1940,‘Advisor’ vs. ‘Adviser’: What’s the Big Deal?,Kiplinger Personal Finance | Latest Updates,The Kiplinger Washington Editors,"Kris Maksimovich  ‘Advisor’ vs. ‘Adviser’: What’s the Big Deal?  You’ve surely seen the term written both ways, so which one is right – and can one simple letter make a difference in the credentials of the financial professionals you work with? Here’s the backstory on how the two terms diverged and what it could mean for you.  The use of “advisor” or “adviser” is far from subjective as some articles on the subject might suggest. In fact, arguing the case for either spelling can send one down an unending dictionary rabbit hole. Either way, the favoritism of one title over another appears to be a source of confusion for investors.  Both titles have deep roots and have been used interchangeably for decades. Webster’s suggests that either advisor or adviser can be used, as both spellings define an individual who engages in the act of advising or offering recommendations. The Associated Press Style Guide, the veritable tome of grammar for editors and writers alike, favors the “-er” version.  The one distinction that most can agree upon is that while “adviser” is the preferred term, both spellings are correct, provided they are used consistently throughout a content piece.  If both “advisor” and “adviser” mean the same thing, then, what exactly is the big deal about the spelling within the financial services industry?  A Schism with Regulatory Roots  Whether the preferred title a financial professional uses today is “advisor” or “adviser,” the choice of spelling is steeped in history. In the distant past, financial professionals labeled themselves as “advisers,” but a rash of malfeasance by advisers — followed by regulatory changes made in the 20th century — brought about a mass migration of firms adopting the “advisor” label instead.  You see, in the 1920s, during the early days of mutual funds, gross abuse plagued investment funds. Funds were often created by “advisers” who dominated the boards of directors for these funds. Rather than increase the value, they placed their own interests, and those of their associates, ahead of investors. So, at this time, many financial professionals chose to label themselves as “advisors” to distance themselves from the nefarious actions of their “adviser” counterparts.  During the Great Depression, it became obvious that a crackdown was necessary to end the abuse that was running rampant in this grave era. In response, the U.S. Investment Advisers Act of 1940 was passed — and while the Act has done a lot of good, its name contributed to the spelling conundrum we see today. A regulatory distinction was inadvertently created because of that choice of spelling. In the eyes of financial professionals, the “adviser” spelling was more related to the regulatory act and financial services regulations.  Another shift occurred naturally. The naming of governing bodies and the verbiage spelled out in the Investment Advisers Act have come to characterize the widely accepted legal and regulatory spelling adoption as “adviser.” The Act requires financial professionals to register with a governing body. Thus, someone who calls himself or herself an “advisor” might work for a Registered Investment Adviser (RIA), or they may be an Investment Adviser Representative of a firm (IAR). The bottom line is that if a professional is engaged in providing ongoing investment advice for compensation, they are required to register as an “investment adviser” regardless of whether their title or the name of the company they work for uses the term “advisor.”   Applying this historical context, it is not surprising to see that the “adviser” spelling has been in print use much longer and may explain why it is the preferred spelling for many long-established dictionaries and journalist sources.  The Current Growing Popularity of Advisor over Adviser  Outside of the regulatory language, there are other driving forces that may have helped instigate the shift in spelling for what financial professionals choose to call themselves today. The “advisor” adaptation that began taking off likely originated from the root word “advisory.” Professionals gradually adopted the more impressive-sounding “advisor” version as a means of inflating their importance as well as distinguishing themselves from the more regulatory adviser governing body.  Over time there also appears to be a shift in public perception. An “advisor” is generally recognized synonymously as a professional. Though some professionals do still prefer the -er version, the numbers have dwindled since the 1940 Act. According to Google NGram Viewer (Figure 1), which is an indicator of the use of words in print, the use of “advisor” has overtaken the use of adviser since 2012.  Figure 1:Financial Advisor vs Financial Adviser  Historical Use of Advisor vs Adviser in print from 1920-2019  Source: Google Books Ngram Viewer  Adding Distance  The Wall Street Crash of 1929 and ensuing Great Depression lasting through 1939 was an impetus for change in the financial services industry. It’s not difficult to see why professionals might want to distance themselves from the rogue “advisers” and their unscrupulous activities prior to the 1940 Act. Since then, the switch has been widely adopted, and it is now customary to use the -er spelling as related to a legal, governing body and the -or spelling as relating to practicing professionals.  Though the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has not weighed in on any regulatory distinction between the spellings, they do focus on whether a professional conforms to laws designed to protect investors. Notably, a portion of this regulation involves avoiding misrepresentation.  The reality is that while financial professionals have long been accused of rearranging the spelling to inflate their importance, that sentiment would not pass regulatory muster without the SEC establishing rules on such use.  When searching for a financial professional or wading through a stream of planning strategies, depending upon the site searched, it may net different results if seeking an “adviser” versus an “advisor.”  Regardless of which spelling financial professionals use, you should expect to receive the same professional services you are searching for. That is, after all, what is more important than a lesson in spelling.  Editor’s Note: Kiplinger’s Personal Finance adheres to the AP Style rule in preferring “adviser” vs. “advisor.” We use the former in all cases except proper nouns.

The add-on is composed of two components:  (a) a flat risk weight add-on of 5 percentage points; and  (b) a  proportionate  risk  weight  add-on  consisting  of  33  per  cent  of  the  exposure-weighted  average  of  the  risk   weights  applied  to  the  portfolio  of  retail  exposures  secured  by  residential  immovable  property  located  in   Belgium.  I. Description of the measure  1. The  Belgian  measure,  applied  in  accordance  with  Article  458(2)(d)(vi)  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  575/2013  and   imposed  on  credit  institutions  authorised  in  Belgium  using  the  IRB  Approach,  consists  of  a  risk  weight  add-on   for  retail  exposures  secured  by  residential  immovable  property  located  in  Belgium,  which  is  composed  of  two   components:  (a) The first component consists of a 5 percentage point increase to the risk weight for retail exposures secured by   residential  immovable  property  located  in  Belgium  obtained  after  computing  the  second  part  of  the  risk-   weight add-on in accordance with point (b).  (b) The second component consists of a risk-weight increase of 33 per cent of the exposure-weighted average of   the  risk-weights  applied  to  the  portfolio  of  retail  exposures  secured  by  residential  immovable  property   located in Belgium.  The  exposure-weighted  average is the average of  the risk-weights  of  the individual loans   calculated  in  accordance  with  Article  154  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  575/2013,  weighted  by  the  relevant   exposure value.  II. Reciprocation  2. In  accordance  with  Article  458(5)  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  575/2013,  relevant  authorities  of  the  Member  States   concerned are recommended to reciprocate the Belgian measure by applying it to branches located in Belgium of   domestically  authorised  credit  institutions  using  the  IRB  Approach  within  the  deadline  specified  in  sub-   recommendation C(3).  3. Relevant  authorities  are  recommended  to  reciprocate  the  Belgian  measure  by  applying  it  to  domestically   authorised  credit  institutions  using  the  IRB  Approach  that  have  direct  retail  exposures  secured  by  residential   immovable  property  located  in  Belgium.  In  accordance  with  sub-recommendation  C(2),  the  relevant  authorities   are recommended to apply the same measure as the one that has been implemented in Belgium by the activating   authority within the deadline specified in sub-recommendation C(3).  4. If  the  same  macroprudential  policy  measure  is  not  available  in  their  jurisdiction,  the  relevant  authorities  are   recommended  to  apply,  following  consultation  with  the  ESRB,  a  macroprudential  policy  measure  available  in   their  jurisdiction  that  has  the  most  equivalent  effect  to  the  above  measure  recommended  for  reciprocation,   including  adopting  supervisory  measures  and  powers  laid  down  in  Title  VII,  Chapter  2,  Section  IV  of   Directive  2013/36/EU.  Relevant  authorities  are recommended  to adopt the  equivalent  measure  by no later  than   four months following the publication of this Recommendation in the   Official Journal of the European Union.  III. Materiality threshold  5. The  measure  is  complemented "

The add-on is composed of two components:  (a) a flat risk weight add-on of 5 percentage points; and  (b) a  proportionate  risk  weight  add-on  consisting  of  33  per  cent  of  the  exposure-weighted  average  of  the  risk   weights  applied  to  the  portfolio  of  retail  exposures  secured  by  residential  immovable  property  located  in   Belgium.  I. Description of the measure  1. The  Belgian  measure,  applied  in  accordance  with  Article  458(2)(d)(vi)  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  575/2013  and   imposed  on  credit  institutions  authorised  in  Belgium  using  the  IRB  Approach,  consists  of  a  risk  weight  add-on   for  retail  exposures  secured  by  residential  immovable  property  located  in  Belgium,  which  is  composed  of  two   components:  (a) The first component consists of a 5 percentage point increase to the risk weight for retail exposures secured by   residential  immovable  property  located  in  Belgium  obtained  after  computing  the  second  part  of  the  risk-   weight add-on in accordance with point (b).  (b) The second component consists of a risk-weight increase of 33 per cent of the exposure-weighted average of   the  risk-weights  applied  to  the  portfolio  of  retail  exposures  secured  by  residential  immovable  property   located in Belgium.  The  exposure-weighted  average is the average of  the risk-weights  of  the individual loans   calculated  in  accordance  with  Article  154  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  575/2013,  weighted  by  the  relevant   exposure value.  II. Reciprocation  2. In  accordance  with  Article  458(5)  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  575/2013,  relevant  authorities  of  the  Member  States   concerned are recommended to reciprocate the Belgian measure by applying it to branches located in Belgium of   domestically  authorised  credit  institutions  using  the  IRB  Approach  within  the  deadline  specified  in  sub-   recommendation C(3).  3. Relevant  authorities  are  recommended  to  reciprocate  the  Belgian  measure  by  applying  it  to  domestically   authorised  credit  institutions  using  the  IRB  Approach  that  have  direct  retail  exposures  secured  by  residential   immovable  property  located  in  Belgium.  In  accordance  with  sub-recommendation  C(2),  the  relevant  authorities   are recommended to apply the same measure as the one that has been implemented in Belgium by the activating   authority within the deadline specified in sub-recommendation C(3).  4. If  the  same  macroprudential  policy  measure  is  not  available  in  their  jurisdiction,  the  relevant  authorities  are   recommended  to  apply,  following  consultation  with  the  ESRB,  a  macroprudential  policy  measure  available  in   their  jurisdiction  that  has  the  most  equivalent  effect  to  the  above  measure  recommended  for  reciprocation,   including  adopting  supervisory  measures  and  powers  laid  down  in  Title  VII,  Chapter  2,  Section  IV  of   Directive  2013/36/EU.  Relevant  authorities  are recommended  to adopt the  equivalent  measure  by no later  than   four months following the publication of this Recommendation in the   Official Journal of the European Union.  III. Materiality threshold  5. The  measure  is  complemented  by  an  institution-specific  materiality  threshold  of  EUR  2  billion  to  steer  the   potential application of the   de minimis   principle by the relevant authorities reciprocating the measure.

In line with Section 2.2.1 of Recommendation ESRB/2015/2, relevant authorities of the Member State concerned   may  exempt  individual  domestically  authorised  credit  institutions  using  the  IRB  Approach  having  non-material   retail exposures secured by residential immovable property in Belgium which are below the materiality threshold   of EUR 2 billion. When applying the materiality threshold, the relevant authorities should monitor the materiality   of exposures and are recommended to apply the Belgian measure to previously exempted individual domestically   authorised credit institutions when the materiality threshold of EUR 2 billion is breached.  7. Where  there  are  no  credit  institutions  authorised  in  the  Member  States  concerned  with  branches  located  in   Belgium or  which have direct retail exposures secured by residential immovable property in Belgium, which use   the  IRB  Approach  and  which  have  exposures  of  EUR  2  billion  or  above  to  the  Belgian  residential  immovable   property  market,  relevant  authorities  of  the  Member  States  concerned  may,  pursuant  to  Section  2.2.1  of   Recommendation  ESRB/2015/2,  decide  not  to  reciprocate  the  Belgian  measure.  In  this  case  the  relevant   authorities  should  monitor  the  materiality  of  the  exposures  and  are  recommended  to  reciprocate  the  Belgian   measure when a credit institution using the IRB Approach exceeds the threshold of EUR 2 billion.  8.

(2)  The framework on voluntary reciprocity for macroprudential policy measures set out in Recommendation ESRB/2015/2 of the European Systemic Risk Board (4) aims to ensure that all exposure-based macroprudential policy measures activated in one Member State are reciprocated in other Member States.  (3)  Following the request by the Haut Conseil de stabilité financière (HCSF, High Council for Financial Stability), acting as the French designated authority for the purpose of Article 458 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, pursuant to Article 458(8) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, the General Board of the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) issued Recommendation ESRB/2018/8 of the European Systemic Risk Board (5) to include stricter national measure concerning the requirements for large exposures laid down in Article 392 and Articles 395 to 403 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (as referred to in Article 458(2)(d)(ii) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013) in the list of macroprudential policy measures which are recommended to be reciprocated under Recommendation ESRB/2015/2.  (4)  The existing stricter national measure imposes tighter large exposure limits (5 % of the eligible capital), with regard to highly-indebted large non-financial corporations (NFCs) that have their registered office in France, on French globally systemically important institutions (G-SIIs) and other systemically important institutions (O-SIIs) at the highest level of consolidation of the banking prudential perimeter of the institution concerned.  (5)  Regulation (EU) 2019/876 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6) introduced amendments to the requirements for large exposures laid down in Article 392 and Articles 395 to 403 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. In particular, from 28 June 2021 institutions must calculate large exposures against Tier 1 capital, excluding Tier 2 capital. The existing stricter national measure has been modified accordingly.  (6)  Therefore, Recommendation ESRB/2015/2 should be amended to reflect the changes to the existing stricter national measure,  HAS ADOPTED THIS RECOMMENDATION  Amendments  Recommendation ESRB/2015/2 is amended as follows:  1.  in Section 1, sub-recommendation C(1) is replaced by the following:  ‘1.  The relevant authorities are recommended to reciprocate the macroprudential policy measures adopted by other relevant authorities and recommended for reciprocation by the ESRB.

ANNEX  The Annex to Recommendation ESRB/2015/2 is replaced by the following:  ‘ANNEX  Belgium  A risk weight add-on for retail exposures secured by residential immovable property located in Belgium, imposed on credit institutions authorised in Belgium using the IRB Approach and applied in accordance with Article 458(2)(d)(vi) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. The add-on is composed of two components:  (a)  a flat risk weight add-on of 5 percentage points; and  (b)  a proportionate risk weight add-on consisting of 33 per cent of the exposure-weighted average of the risk weights applied to the portfolio of retail exposures secured by residential immovable property located in Belgium.  I. Description of the measure  1.  The Belgian measure, applied in accordance with Article 458(2)(d)(vi) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and imposed on credit institutions authorised in Belgium using the IRB Approach, consists of a risk weight add-on for retail exposures secured by residential immovable property located in Belgium, which is composed of two components:  (a)  The first component consists of a 5 percentage point increase to the risk weight for retail exposures secured by residential immovable property located in Belgium obtained after computing the second part of the risk-weight add-on in accordance with point (b).  (b)  The second component consists of a risk-weight increase of 33 per cent of the exposure-weighted average of the risk-weights applied to the portfolio of retail exposures secured by residential immovable property located in Belgium. The exposure-weighted average is the average of the risk-weights of the individual loans calculated in accordance with Article 154 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, weighted by the relevant exposure value.  II. Reciprocation  2.  In accordance with Article 458(5) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, relevant authorities of the Member States concerned are recommended to reciprocate the Belgian measure by applying it to branches located in Belgium of domestically authorised credit institutions using the IRB Approach within the deadline specified in sub-recommendation C(3).  3.  Relevant authorities are recommended to reciprocate the Belgian measure by applying it to domestically authorised credit institutions using the IRB Approach that have direct retail exposures secured by residential immovable property located in Belgium. In accordance with sub-recommendation C(2), the relevant authorities are recommended to apply the same measure as the one that has been implemented in Belgium by the activating authority within the deadline specified in sub-recommendation C(3).  4.  If the same macroprudential policy measure is not available in their jurisdiction, the relevant authorities are recommended to apply, following consultation with the ESRB, a macroprudential policy measure available in their jurisdiction that has the most equivalent effect to the above measure recommended for reciprocation, including adopting supervisory measures and powers laid down in Title VII, Chapter 2, Section IV of Directive 2013/36/EU. Relevant authorities are recommended to adopt the equivalent measure by no later than four months following the publication of this Recommendation in the Official Journal of the European Union.  III. Materiality threshold  5.  The measure is complemented by an institution-specific materiality threshold of EUR 2 billion to steer the potential application of the de minimis principle by the relevant authorities reciprocating the measure.  6.  In line with Section 2.2.1 of Recommendation ESRB/2015/2, relevant authorities of the Member State concerned may exempt individual domestically authorised credit institutions using the IRB Approach having non-material retail exposures secured by residential immovable property in Belgium which are below the materiality threshold of EUR 2 billion. When applying the materiality threshold, the relevant authorities should monitor the materiality of exposures and are recommended to apply the Belgian measure to previously exempted individual domestically authorised credit institutions when the materiality threshold of EUR 2 billion is breached.  7.  Where there are no credit institutions authorised in the Member States concerned with branches located in Belgium or which have direct retail exposures secured by residential immovable property in Belgium, which use the IRB Approach and which have exposures of EUR 2 billion or above to the Belgian residential immovable property market, relevant authorities of the Member States concerned may, pursuant to Section 2.2.1 of Recommendation ESRB/2015/2, decide not to reciprocate the Belgian measure. In this case the relevant authorities should monitor the materiality of the exposures and are recommended to reciprocate the Belgian measure when a credit institution using the IRB Approach exceeds the threshold of EUR 2 billion.  8.  In line with Section 2.2.1 of Recommendation ESRB/2015/2, the materiality threshold of EUR 2 billion is a recommended maximum threshold level. Reciprocating relevant authorities may therefore instead of applying the recommended threshold set a lower threshold for their jurisdictions where appropriate, or reciprocate the measure without any materiality threshold.  France  A tightening of the large exposure limit provided for in Article 395(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, applicable to exposures to highly-indebted large non-financial corporations having their registered office in France to 5 per cent of Tier 1 capital, applied in accordance with Article 458(2)(d)(ii) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 to global systemically important institutions (G-SIIs) and other systemically important institutions (O-SIIs) at the highest level of consolidation of their banking prudential perimeter.  I. Description of the measure  1.  The French measure, applied in accordance with Article 458(2)(d)(ii) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and imposed on G-SIIs and O-SIIs at the highest level of consolidation of their banking prudential perimeter (not at a sub-consolidated level), consists of a tightening of the large exposure limit to 5 per cent of their Tier 1 capital, applicable to exposures to highly-indebted large non-financial corporations having their registered office in France.  2.  A non-financial corporation is defined as a natural or legal person under private law having its registered office in France, and which, at its level and at the highest level of consolidation, belongs to the non-financial corporations sector as defined in point 2.45 of Annex A to Regulation (EU) No 549/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (*1).  3.

Freedom of Information Act,Arkansas Inmates Say They Were Given Ivermectin For COVID-19 Without Their Consent,The Huffington Post | Good News Highlights,The Huffington Post,"Arkansas Inmates Say They Were Given Ivermectin For COVID-19 Without Their Consent  “I asked what are they, and they’d just tell me vitamins,” one inmate said.  People incarcerated in an Arkansas jail say the facility’s physician prescribed them ivermectin to treat COVID-19 and that they weren’t aware they were taking the drug.  The anti-parasite drug, typically used to deworm horses and cattle, has developed an unlikely ― and baseless ― reputation as a COVID treatment in humans, despite stern warnings from the Food and Drug Administration.  Washington County jail physician Dr. Rob Karas acknowledged in an interview with CBS affiliate KFSM that he prescribed ivermectin to incarcerated people with COVID symptoms, but said they were “not forced” to take the drug.  But accounts given by people in the facility call that claim into question.  “I asked what are they, and they’d just tell me vitamins,” one inmate, Edrick Floreal-Wooten, told the Associated Press. “With me being sick and all of us being sick, we thought that they were there to help us. I never thought they would do something shady.”  “They were pretty much testing us in here is all they were doing, seeing if it would work,” said William Evans, another inmate who said he was given the drug for two weeks after he tested positive for COVID.  Floreal-Wooten told CBS that medicine in the jail is distributed via a pill drawer that obscures the bottles so people receiving the drugs can’t see their labels. None of the inmates were aware of what they were taking until they read about it in the news, he added.  The practice only came to light after Dr. Karas prescribed ivermectin to a county employee after he tested negative for COVID. The employee sought a second opinion from his primary care physician, then alerted Eva Madison, a county official, who flagged it during a budget meeting.  Madison said she confronted Dr. Karas, who defended his actions by pointing to a website touting ivermectin despite the FDA’s claims to the contrary. Madison characterized the website as “a little bit suspect.”  “The employee had the good fortune to have a physician he could go to and ask for a second opinion. Our inmates do not have that choice,” Madison said. “It’s very disturbing to me that that’s the level of medical care that we’re providing to the folks down at the jail.”   Documents obtained under a Freedom of Information Act request by the AP show the state Medical Board was already looking into complaints about Karas before the ivermectin allegations surfaced. Earlier complaints allege Karas was using social media to cast doubt on the use of face masks to slow the spread of COVID.  The Arkansas Medical Board is investigating the reports of Karas prescribing ivermectin but declined to elaborate in a statement to the AP. Karas did not immediately respond to a HuffPost request for comment.  In a letter to Washington County Sheriff Tim Helder last week, Gary Sullivan, the legal director of the ACLU of Arkansas, said the organization is considering legal action over the “unconscionable” allegations.

Basel IV,India’s banking sector survives covid scare but needs to address these challenges now,Financial Express | Industry,Financial Express,"India’s banking sector survives covid scare but needs to address these challenges now  Over the last 7 years the NDA government has been infusing capital into the public sector banks using recapitalization bonds. However, following COVID and the expectations from the Union Budget 2021-22, liquidity has become a huge issue.  The Indian banking sector is resilient, sufficiently capitalized and well-regulated segment. Over the last 7 years the NDA government has been infusing capital into the public sector banks using recapitalization bonds. However, following COVID and the expectations from the Union Budget 2021-22, liquidity has become a huge issue. Since the last few years, several European banks have confirmed certain disposal operations of impaired loans. This has largely contributed to a significant reduction of the NPL ratio. However, the birth of a huge secondary market for bad debts and the unification of standardized large-ticket assets in order to construct a ‘single-name’ portfolio has given way to newer problems. In fact, the banking sector is silently reeling under the challenges thrown towards it, which are:  Maintaining Capital Adequacy: The capital a bank sets aside for its rainy day or to undertake lending activities acts more like the bank’s risk threshold. However, in the post-COVID world banks are facing fresh ambush of NPAs on unsecured loans. Earlier RBI has offered moratorium on loans and has also announced the two-year restructuring on loans to safeguard weak borrowers, but this situation hints at the NPAs increasing from 7.5 per cent in September last year to 13.5 per cent by September this year, putting a lot of stress on banks. Unless the government pumps in money externally, banks will be in severe loss creating massive capital adequacy problems. Bad loans and in failing with maintaining the minimum RBI prescribed Capital Adequacy Ratio, banks will have to face severe challenges in due course. Moreover, the Basel IV standards that limit the reduction in capital is due to be formalized in January 2023. Earlier, following the global financial crisis of 2007-08 the international implementation of Basel III was formalized and that has already raised the capital adequacy quotient for banks in order to mitigate risks. Now, Basel IV, according to global banks will raise the bar of capital further, which is definitely a sign of worry for India, given its present state.  Maintaining Asset Quality: Bad loans are a big problem for the Indian banking sector, especially the PSBs. As per an IMF report 36.9% of the total debt in India is at risk and banks have capacity to absorb only 7.9% loss. Add the COVID crisis to this and the banks are struggling to recover loans from small businesses, which have been severely affected by COVID. The pandemic has put a halt in business all across, so loan recovery is a big question mark, which definitely hurts the banking sector as they struggle to maintain the quality of their assets.  Maintaining Growth: The overall economic growth of the country is shunted at the moment and an outward push can only help every contributing sector of the economy –corporates, retail, and rural prominently. The growth impetus is financial at the moment and the sooner the sectors recover, the healthier it will be for the banking sector. As of now, the banking sector has no way of fulfilling its growth aspirations and is barely struggling to stay on ground.  Keeping these top 3 challenges in mind, here are a few suggestions for the banking sector in India, which will help them revive their status.  Things to work out in short term  Restructuring: RBI’s restructuring guidelines on loans for individuals and businesses not only work as a relief for the borrowers, but it also gives a scope to banks to maintain their status quo. Banks should use this relief period to improve their asset quality while continuing being a pillar of support to the MSMEs. This restructuring is RBI advised and the framework keeping in mind the benefit of the banks and customers have been specially devised and has come in to effect since April 1, 2021. Since the regulatory guidelines for the loan restructuring are RBI directed so the implications of customers delaying payments will not come harshly on the banks. This gives the financial institutions a chance to reorient themselves.  Lower interest rates on loans: The COVID crisis has pushed the economy to go off track and financial shortages is an evident problem all across. Constant cash flow is a problem with both the service sector and as well as individuals. Indian banking sector should use this premise to their credit and begin offering lower interest rate loans to individuals and MSMEs. This will encourage lending, which will stimulate overall economic growth and give banks a chance to improve on their CAR. Reform has already started in the home loan finance space, interest rates for home loans in India at present have fallen to historic lows. What was around 8.40% during September 2019 is now at 6.49-6.95% range.  Improved diligence: While it is necessary to pump in more money in to the system to help sustain businesses and to boost the economy, it is also equally a necessity to keep bad loans at bay. Bad loans lead to higher NPAs over time, so due diligence has to be observed when offering funds. This will help keep frauds and unscrupulous people at distance and the banks will then be able to extend money to rightful and needy businesses or individuals. Proper scrutiny and stringent application measures will help avoid wrongdoings. Moreover, banks should be cautious when giving loans to Indian companies who have heavily borrowed abroad. This is because according to RBI, this will put banks under unnecessary exposure to dollar and will further add to their existing pool of problems.  Things to work out in long term  Technology upgradation: Digitalization is the buzz word for businesses and banking, especially PSBs should adapt to the concept of digital to make banking operating seamless. Technology will make or break the way people look at services in the coming time, so banks should ride the bus before it leaves the stop. From adding top-notch technology to upgrade services to upgrading existing set-up, a lot of opportunities lies in technology and harnessing the same will help bringing in a big change in approaches.  Technology reach: Tech inclusion and tech literacy campaigns should be undertaken to ensure that paperless banking or basic tech services are so easy to use that it is available/accessible and usable to all. This is not undoable. If people can order products on Amazon, use Facebook, why not banking services. Of course, with appropriate security measures in place.  Focus on MSMEs: Banks, including PSUs are primarily keeping their attention on retail advances or corporates today. The banking sector mostly chooses to ignore the MSME advances. This trend is not healthy for the economy and will not help banks grow in the days to follow. MSMEs are the backbone of Indian economy and creates employment for 70 million people. This sector has a 16% contribution to the Indian GDP, which as per reports is to become 25% by 2022. Certainly, the prosperity and growth of this sector will help leverage the economy and give it a prosperous enrichment.  Customer-centric Innovation: Innovation is key to customer loyalty in today’s day and age and in order to win customer loyalty in long term, banks should focus more on innovation. Keeping pace with the changing environment and other industry practices the banking sector should invest in innovation that will help them serve their customers with ease. The more agile the services and banking practices, the easier it will be for the customer to bank with the partner.  The pandemic has been an eye opener for everyone in some way or other. However, counting in the positives of the pandemic there is a chance to relook at the economy. This is the right time to repair and reorient as we prepare for a better tomorrow.

I. Description of the measure  1. The  Belgian  measure,  applied  in  accordance  with  Article  458(2)(d)(vi)  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  575/2013  and   imposed  on  credit  institutions  authorised  in  Belgium  using  the  IRB  Approach,  consists  of  a  risk  weight  add-on   for  retail  exposures  secured  by  residential  immovable  property  located  in  Belgium,  which  is  composed  of  two   components:  (a) The first component consists of a 5 percentage point increase to the risk weight for retail exposures secured by   residential  immovable  property  located  in  Belgium  obtained  after  computing  the  second  part  of  the  risk-   weight add-on in accordance with point (b).  (b) The second component consists of a risk-weight increase of 33 per cent of the exposure-weighted average of   the  risk-weights  applied  to  the  portfolio  of  retail  exposures  secured  by  residential  immovable  property   located in Belgium.  The  exposure-weighted  average is the average of  the risk-weights  of  the individual loans   calculated  in  accordance  with  Article  154  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  575/2013,  weighted  by  the  relevant   exposure value.  II. Reciprocation  2. In  accordance  with  Article  458(5)  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  575/2013,  relevant  authorities  of  the  Member  States   concerned are recommended to reciprocate the Belgian measure by applying it to branches located in Belgium of   domestically  authorised  credit  institutions  using  the  IRB  Approach  within  the  deadline  specified  in  sub-   recommendation C(3).  3. Relevant  authorities  are  recommended  to  reciprocate  the  Belgian  measure  by  applying  it  to  domestically   authorised  credit  institutions  using  the  IRB  Approach  that  have  direct  retail  exposures  secured  by  residential   immovable  property  located  in  Belgium.  In  accordance  with  sub-recommendation  C(2),  the  relevant  authorities   are recommended to apply the same measure as the one that has been implemented in Belgium by the activating   authority within the deadline specified in sub-recommendation C(3).  4. If  the  same  macroprudential  policy  measure  is  not  available  in  their  jurisdiction,  the  relevant  authorities  are   recommended  to  apply,  following  consultation  with  the  ESRB,  a  macroprudential  policy  measure  available  in   their  jurisdiction  that  has  the  most  equivalent  effect  to  the  above  measure  recommended  for  reciprocation,   including  adopting  supervisory  measures  and  powers  laid  down  in  Title  VII,  Chapter  2,  Section  IV  of   Directive  2013/36/EU.  Relevant  authorities  are recommended  to adopt the  equivalent  measure  by no later  than   four months following the publication of this Recommendation in the   Official Journal of the European Union.  III. Materiality threshold  5. The  measure  is  complemented  by  an  institution-specific  materiality  threshold  of  EUR  2  billion  to  steer  the   potential application of the   de minimis   principle by the relevant authorities reciprocating the measure.  EN   Official  Journal  of  the  European  Union   C  358/4                                                                                                                                             7.9.2021    6. In line with Section 2.2.1 of Recommendation ESRB/2015/2, relevant authorities of the Member State concerned   may  exempt  individual  domestically  authorised  credit  institutions  using  the  IRB  Approach  having  non-material   retail exposures secured by residential immovable property in Belgium which are below the materiality threshold   of EUR 2 billion. When applying the materiality threshold, the relevant authorities should monitor the materiality   of exposures and are recommended to apply the Belgian measure to previously exempted individual domestically   authorised credit institutions when the materiality threshold of EUR 2 billion is breached.  7. Where  there  are  no  credit  institutions  authorised  in  the  Member  States  concerned  with  branches  located  in   Belgium or  which have direct retail exposures secured by residential immovable property in Belgium, which use   the  IRB  Approach  and  which  have  exposures  of  EUR  2  billion  or  above  to  the  Belgian  residential  immovable   property  market,  relevant  authorities  of  the  Member  States  concerned  may,  pursuant  to  Section  2.2.1  of   Recommendation  ESRB/2015/2,  decide  not  to  reciprocate  the  Belgian  measure.  In  this  case  the  relevant   authorities  should  monitor  the  materiality  of  the  exposures  and  are  recommended  to  reciprocate  the  Belgian   measure when a credit institution using the IRB Approach exceeds the threshold of EUR 2 billion.  8. In  line  with  Section  2.2.1  of  Recommendation  ESRB/2015/2,  the  materiality  threshold"

(3)  Following the request by the Haut Conseil de stabilité financière (HCSF, High Council for Financial Stability), acting as the French designated authority for the purpose of Article 458 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, pursuant to Article 458(8) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, the General Board of the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) issued Recommendation ESRB/2018/8 of the European Systemic Risk Board (5) to include stricter national measure concerning the requirements for large exposures laid down in Article 392 and Articles 395 to 403 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (as referred to in Article 458(2)(d)(ii) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013) in the list of macroprudential policy measures which are recommended to be reciprocated under Recommendation ESRB/2015/2.  (4)  The existing stricter national measure imposes tighter large exposure limits (5 % of the eligible capital), with regard to highly-indebted large non-financial corporations (NFCs) that have their registered office in France, on French globally systemically important institutions (G-SIIs) and other systemically important institutions (O-SIIs) at the highest level of consolidation of the banking prudential perimeter of the institution concerned.  (5)  Regulation (EU) 2019/876 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6) introduced amendments to the requirements for large exposures laid down in Article 392 and Articles 395 to 403 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. In particular, from 28 June 2021 institutions must calculate large exposures against Tier 1 capital, excluding Tier 2 capital. The existing stricter national measure has been modified accordingly.  (6)  Therefore, Recommendation ESRB/2015/2 should be amended to reflect the changes to the existing stricter national measure,  HAS ADOPTED THIS RECOMMENDATION  Amendments  Recommendation ESRB/2015/2 is amended as follows:  1.  in Section 1, sub-recommendation C(1) is replaced by the following:  ‘1.  The relevant authorities are recommended to reciprocate the macroprudential policy measures adopted by other relevant authorities and recommended for reciprocation by the ESRB. It is recommended that the following measures, as further described in the Annex, be reciprocated:  Belgium:  a risk-weight add-on for retail exposures secured by residential immovable property located in Belgium, applied in accordance with Article 458(2)(d)(vi) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 to credit institutions authorised in Belgium, using the IRB Approach for calculating regulatory capital requirements and composed of:  (a)  a flat risk-weight add-on of 5 percentage points; and  (b)  a proportionate risk-weight add-on consisting of 33 per cent of the exposure-weighted average of the risk-weights applied to the portfolio of retail exposures secured by residential immovable property located in Belgium;  France:  a tightening of the large exposure limit provided for in Article 395(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, applicable to exposures to highly-indebted large non-financial corporations having their registered office in France to 5 per cent of Tier 1 capital, applied in accordance with Article 458(2)(d)(ii) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 to global systemically important institutions (G-SIIs) and other systemically important institutions (O-SIIs) at the highest level of consolidation of their banking prudential perimeter;  Luxembourg:  legally binding loan-to-value (LTV) limits for new mortgage loans on residential real estate located in Luxembourg, with different LTV limits applicable to different categories of borrowers:  (a)  LTV limit of 100 % for first-time buyers acquiring their primary residence;  (b)  LTV limit of 90 % for other buyers i.e. non first-time buyers acquiring their primary residence. This limit is implemented in a proportional way via a portfolio allowance. Specifically, lenders may issue 15 % of the portfolio of new mortgages granted to these borrowers with an LTV above 90 % but below the maximum LTV of 100 %;  (c)  LTV limit of 80 % for other mortgage loans (including the buy-to-let segment).

ANNEX  The Annex to Recommendation ESRB/2015/2 is replaced by the following:  ‘ANNEX  Belgium  A risk weight add-on for retail exposures secured by residential immovable property located in Belgium, imposed on credit institutions authorised in Belgium using the IRB Approach and applied in accordance with Article 458(2)(d)(vi) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. The add-on is composed of two components:  (a)  a flat risk weight add-on of 5 percentage points; and  (b)  a proportionate risk weight add-on consisting of 33 per cent of the exposure-weighted average of the risk weights applied to the portfolio of retail exposures secured by residential immovable property located in Belgium.  I. Description of the measure  1.  The Belgian measure, applied in accordance with Article 458(2)(d)(vi) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and imposed on credit institutions authorised in Belgium using the IRB Approach, consists of a risk weight add-on for retail exposures secured by residential immovable property located in Belgium, which is composed of two components:  (a)  The first component consists of a 5 percentage point increase to the risk weight for retail exposures secured by residential immovable property located in Belgium obtained after computing the second part of the risk-weight add-on in accordance with point (b).  (b)  The second component consists of a risk-weight increase of 33 per cent of the exposure-weighted average of the risk-weights applied to the portfolio of retail exposures secured by residential immovable property located in Belgium. The exposure-weighted average is the average of the risk-weights of the individual loans calculated in accordance with Article 154 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, weighted by the relevant exposure value.  II. Reciprocation  2.  In accordance with Article 458(5) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, relevant authorities of the Member States concerned are recommended to reciprocate the Belgian measure by applying it to branches located in Belgium of domestically authorised credit institutions using the IRB Approach within the deadline specified in sub-recommendation C(3).  3.  Relevant authorities are recommended to reciprocate the Belgian measure by applying it to domestically authorised credit institutions using the IRB Approach that have direct retail exposures secured by residential immovable property located in Belgium. In accordance with sub-recommendation C(2), the relevant authorities are recommended to apply the same measure as the one that has been implemented in Belgium by the activating authority within the deadline specified in sub-recommendation C(3).  4.  If the same macroprudential policy measure is not available in their jurisdiction, the relevant authorities are recommended to apply, following consultation with the ESRB, a macroprudential policy measure available in their jurisdiction that has the most equivalent effect to the above measure recommended for reciprocation, including adopting supervisory measures and powers laid down in Title VII, Chapter 2, Section IV of Directive 2013/36/EU. Relevant authorities are recommended to adopt the equivalent measure by no later than four months following the publication of this Recommendation in the Official Journal of the European Union.  III. Materiality threshold  5.  The measure is complemented by an institution-specific materiality threshold of EUR 2 billion to steer the potential application of the de minimis principle by the relevant authorities reciprocating the measure.  6.  In line with Section 2.2.1 of Recommendation ESRB/2015/2, relevant authorities of the Member State concerned may exempt individual domestically authorised credit institutions using the IRB Approach having non-material retail exposures secured by residential immovable property in Belgium which are below the materiality threshold of EUR 2 billion. When applying the materiality threshold, the relevant authorities should monitor the materiality of exposures and are recommended to apply the Belgian measure to previously exempted individual domestically authorised credit institutions when the materiality threshold of EUR 2 billion is breached.  7.  Where there are no credit institutions authorised in the Member States concerned with branches located in Belgium or which have direct retail exposures secured by residential immovable property in Belgium, which use the IRB Approach and which have exposures of EUR 2 billion or above to the Belgian residential immovable property market, relevant authorities of the Member States concerned may, pursuant to Section 2.2.1 of Recommendation ESRB/2015/2, decide not to reciprocate the Belgian measure. In this case the relevant authorities should monitor the materiality of the exposures and are recommended to reciprocate the Belgian measure when a credit institution using the IRB Approach exceeds the threshold of EUR 2 billion.  8.  In line with Section 2.2.1 of Recommendation ESRB/2015/2, the materiality threshold of EUR 2 billion is a recommended maximum threshold level. Reciprocating relevant authorities may therefore instead of applying the recommended threshold set a lower threshold for their jurisdictions where appropriate, or reciprocate the measure without any materiality threshold.  France  A tightening of the large exposure limit provided for in Article 395(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, applicable to exposures to highly-indebted large non-financial corporations having their registered office in France to 5 per cent of Tier 1 capital, applied in accordance with Article 458(2)(d)(ii) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 to global systemically important institutions (G-SIIs) and other systemically important institutions (O-SIIs) at the highest level of consolidation of their banking prudential perimeter.  I. Description of the measure  1.  The French measure, applied in accordance with Article 458(2)(d)(ii) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and imposed on G-SIIs and O-SIIs at the highest level of consolidation of their banking prudential perimeter (not at a sub-consolidated level), consists of a tightening of the large exposure limit to 5 per cent of their Tier 1 capital, applicable to exposures to highly-indebted large non-financial corporations having their registered office in France.  2.  A non-financial corporation is defined as a natural or legal person under private law having its registered office in France, and which, at its level and at the highest level of consolidation, belongs to the non-financial corporations sector as defined in point 2.45 of Annex A to Regulation (EU) No 549/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (*1).  3.  The measure applies to exposures to non-financial corporations having their registered office in France and to exposures to groups of connected non-financial corporations as follows:  (a)  For non-financial corporations which are part of a group of connected non-financial corporations having its registered office at the highest level of cons"
Americans with Disabilities Act,Millions suffer from 'long COVID.' U.S. disability law may protect them from discrimination,Courier-Post | Latest Posts,Courier Post,"NorthJersey.com  Millions suffer from 'long COVID.' U.S. disability law may protect them from discrimination  As COVID ""long haulers"" go back to work after illness, they may be entitled to workplace accommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act.  President Joe Biden celebrated the 31st anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act Monday and announced new guidance suggesting long-term COVID-19 could be considered a disability in some cases under federal civil rights laws. (July 26)  When the Americans with Disabilities Act became law, none of its sponsors could have predicted that 31 years later it could be invoked to protect people with long-haul COVID from discrimination.  But as people with post-acute COVID syndrome, or “long COVID,” try to go back to work after their illness, the limitations they experience from COVID’s long-term effects may rise to the level of a disability and entitle them to special arrangements to do their jobs.  “We’re bringing agencies together to make sure Americans with long COVID who have a disability have access to the rights and resources that are due under the disability law,” President Joe Biden said in July, when he marked the anniversary of the federal law. He said the rights of people with long COVID could include accommodations in the workplace, schools and health care.  More than 11 million people nationwide are living with long COVID, based on estimates that symptoms persist — or new ones develop — more than six months after infection in 10% to 30% of those infected.  That would be more than 318,000 people in New Jersey, according to estimates by the American Academy for Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation — numbers that continue to grow as more people are infected.  Their symptoms can include shortness of breath and respiratory problems, muscle aches, brain fog, anxiety, depression, fatigue — especially after exertion, and a host of other conditions described by the federal Centers for Disease Control. Whether these symptoms are temporary or will develop into chronic conditions is the subject of research funded by the National Institutes of Health.  People who are hospitalized appear more likely to develop long COVID, but even some who had asymptomatic cases of the disease may later develop residual effects.  A recent study published in the Lancet of more than 1,000 patients from the pandemic’s early days at a hospital in Wuhan, China found that half of patients whose illness was severe enough to require hospitalization had one symptom that persisted a year later. The most common were breathing difficulties, fatigue and muscle weakness, anxiety, depression, sleep problems and loss of smell.  “We know these are symptoms that can persist for weeks or months and may range from mild to incapacitating,” Taryn Mackenzie Williams, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of Labor for disability employment policy, said of long-COVID. She heads the department's efforts to apply the protections of federal disability law to long COVID.  For employees or potential employees with long COVID, symptoms may affect their ability to do their jobs. In many cases, even if they don’t think of themselves as disabled, they are entitled to workplace arrangements that accommodate their limitations, said Tracie DeFreitas, a consultant and ADA specialist for the Job Accommodation Network, which is funded by the Department of Labor.  For example, an employee with a long-COVID disability can ask for a modified or part-time schedule, rest periods during their shift, reassignment to a vacant position or equipment that makes it easier to do their essential tasks.  For instance, a nurse returning to work after COVID had caused damage to her lungs could work fewer hours or be reassigned to a job that involves more time at a desk and less at the bedside.  Or a worker on a production line who experiences fatigue could be allowed rest periods and given a stool to sit on or lean against rather than standing the whole shift, said DeFreitas.  “Each situation is individual,” she said. “When it comes to long COVID or any chronic condition, the right accommodation will depend on an individual’s symptoms, limitations, job tasks and individual needs.”  The employer is not required to give the employee exactly what they ask for, as long as the accommodation offered is effective, under federal disabilities law. Nor are employers expected to eliminate the job’s essential functions, lower production standards, or do anything that causes them “undue hardship.”  The goal is to enable a person to do the essential tasks of their job, DeFreitas said. “There are many ways to do that.”  The Job Accommodation Network provides free, confidential advice to workers and their employers about various modifications that can be considered.  A lot has been learned about flexibility in the workplace from changes brought about by the pandemic, including telework.  “We have all learned how to adapt and be flexible,” said DeFreitas. Widespread innovations such as working from home, remote conferencing, and flexible schedules help everyone, but may be especially useful for those with long COVID, she said.  The Labor Department and other federal agencies have assembled materials to explain the criteria for determining if long COVID is a disability protected by federal law, how to ask an employer for for workplace accommodations, and considerations for employers, Williams said.  Under the civil rights law, if a person’s long COVID symptoms “substantially limit” a major life activity such as sleeping, breathing, thinking, concentrating, or working, it is considered a disability that entitles the person to protection against discrimination. There is no standard definition; each case must be assessed individually.  The employee must ask for a workplace accommodation. While there’s no set form to do so, they should say that they are asking because of a medical condition. In response, the employer can ask for information related to the disability, but not for general, or unrelated, medical information.  The law applies to employers with 15 or more employees. The accommodations can be temporary, and discontinued when the symptoms go away.  Lindy Washburn is a senior health care reporter for NorthJersey.com.

Basel III,Narodowy Bank Polski popiera pełne przyjęcie w UE zapisów pakietu Bazylea III,MarketScreener.com | All Latest News,MarketScreener,"Narodowy Bank Polski popiera pełne przyjęcie w UE zapisów pakietu Bazylea III  Mairead McGuinness Commissioner for Financial Services, Financial Stability and Capital Markets Union European Commission 200 Rue de la Loi B-1049 Brussels Belgium John Berrigan Director-General Directorate-General for Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union European Commission B-1049 Brussels Belgium The EU should stick to the Basel III agreement The European Commission is currently preparing a legislative proposal to implement the final parts of the globally agreed Basel III framework for banks. The global financial crisis of 2007-2010, clearly demonstrated the need to strengthen the prudential treatment of banks and it took about 8 years to agree on all the aspects of the Basel III agreement. We, as prudential supervisors and central banks in the EU, very much support a full, timely and consistent implementation of all aspects of this framework. In our view, this implementation should adhere to both the letter and the spirit of the Basel III agreement. Diluting the framework would not be in the best interests of Europe. The pandemic shows that more resilient banks are better able to support the real economy, even during times of crisis. Ensuring that banks are resilient is therefore good for economic growth, something Europe clearly needs. Adhering to the Basel framework would also facilitate market monitoring, as it simplifies comparisons of different banks. This, in turn, would assist in the much-needed restructuring of the European banking industry. Both the global financial crisis and the pandemic have demonstrated the interdependencies between economies globally. What happens in the US sub-prime market or in Wuhan affects us all. In such an environment, we are all better off implementing the minimum standards to ensure the resilience we all need. The EU is no exception to this. Furthermore, if the EU deviates from the agreement, implementation may also be derailed in other countries. It is therefore in the long term interests of the EU to implement globally agreed standards, including all aspects of the Basel III-agreement, in a full, timely and consistent way. This has three important implications. Firstly, the output floor should be implemented as agreed in Basel, with all risk-based capital measures and buffers calculated on the basis of one single set of risk-weighted assets. This has several benefits. It is simple and transparent. It reduces the variability of risk-weighted assets. It builds confidence in banks' capital structures. It improves the level playing field between banks using internal models and banks using standardised models, as well as between different banks using internal models worldwide. It also increases the usability of the capital buffers. A parallel stack approach to the output floor does not attain these benefits and therefore should not be pursued. Furthermore, it should be considered to apply the output floor to all levels of consolidation, consistent with other prudential requirements, such as the leverage ratio. Secondly, the new Basel standardised approach for credit risk should be implemented as agreed globally. This new approach is more risk sensitive than the old one. It entails a delicate balance between the risks in different exposure types and we should preserve that balance. Thirdly, EU specific deviations should be minimised. There are already some deviations from Basel and these should be re-assessed. In addition, the EU should refrain from making further exemptions from Basel III or from making the banking regulatory framework more complex. To conclude, we want to stress the need for the full, timely and consistent implementation of all Basel III standards. This has been agreed globally, both by the Governors and Heads of Supervision of the Basel Committee members1, and by the G20-leaders2. The EU should follow through on this commitment. It is in our common interest. 7 September 2021 and published on all authorities' websites.

Basel III,The EU should stick to the Basel III agreement,Banka Slovenije | Media,Banka Slovenije,"The EU should stick to the Basel III agreement  During the autumn, the European Commission will publish a proposal for updated capital adequacy rules for banks within the EU. Banka Slovenije as well as a large number of other national central banks and supervisory authorities in the EU, call on the European Commission to respect the letter and spirit of this global agreement.  In a joint letter, Banka Slovenije and 24 other national central banks and financial supervisory authorities from 20 member states within the EU are now calling for the European Commission to ensure that the proposal on updated capital adequacy rules for banks in the EU follows the global agreement known as Basel III. More precisely, we who are signing the joint letter wish to particularly emphasise that the output floor for risk-weighted assets and the standard method for credit risk should comply with the international agreement and that the EU should not introduce any EU-specific deviations from the rules. Deviating from the Basel agreement could have a negative impact on confidence in both the European banking sector and the EU regulatory framework. This in turn risks leading to negative consequences for the banks and the economies in general.

A bench headed by Justice A M Khanwilkar was hearing a batch of pleas, including the one which has said that May 18 notification of the Ministry of Home Affairs had extended the date for compliance of specific provisions of the law regarding opening of account in the designated branch of State of Bank of India here from March 31, 2021 to June 30 this year.  One of the petitions said the ministry has also validated the licences of these NGOs and individuals till September this year and these decisions were taken only on the grounds of COVID-19 exigency, as many NGOs are involved in COVID relief work.  “As prayed by counsel for the respondent-Union of India, three weeks’ time is granted to the respondent(s) to file counter affidavit, and thereafter one week's time is granted to the petitioners to file rejoinder affidavit,"" the bench, also comprising justices Hrishikesh Roy and C T Ravikumar, said in its order.  The apex court, while posting the matter for hearing on October 5, said it will be open to the respondents to file a common reply affidavit which can be used in all these cases.  One of the petitions has been filed Maharashtra-based Vinay Vinayak Joshi who has sought direction to the Centre not to grant any further extension for compliance with the provisions of the Act.  The plea, filed through advocate Gautam Jha, has also sought directions to the government to maintain a register of all NGOs who are involved in receiving funds under the FCRA, particularly during COVID times.  It said the petitioner does not dispute the fact that many genuine NGOs and individuals, holding FCRA licence, are doing significant work, particularly for COVID relief."
False Claims Act,FCA Board Minutes: 21 & 22 July 2021 [pdf],Financial Conduct Authority | Publications | Corporate Documents | Meeting minutes,Financial Conduct Authority (FCA),"FCA Board Minutes: 21 & 22 July 2021  Minutes of the FCA Board meeting held on 21 & 22 July 2021  Minutes   Meeting:  FCA Board   Date of Meeting:  21 & 22 July 2021   Venue:  Meeting held via Microsoft Teams   Present:  Charles Randell (Chair)  Alice Maynard   Bernadette Conroy  Nikhil Rathi   Liam Coleman  Tommaso Valletti   Jeannette Lichner  Sam Woods   Richard Lloyd   In attendance:  Set out in Annex A   1  Quorum and declarations of interest   1.1  The meeting noted there was a quorum present and proceeded to business.   1.2  The Board was reminded of the former role held by Mr Coleman at a firm impacted by the   independent review on the supervisory intervention on interest rate hedging products.  In   response Mr Coleman had agreed to absent himself for the related item.  Mr Randell and Ms   Lichner confirmed that client work they had undertaken in former roles for impacted firms   had not been related to interest rate hedging products.  On this basis, the Board did not   consider that this constituted a conflict of interest in relation to the accompanying item.   1.3  Mr Lloyd declared that he had been permanently appointed as Chair of the Independent   Parliamentary Standards Authority which sets, administers and regulates MPs’ staffing and   business costs, pay, and pensions.  The Board did not consider that this constituted a conflict   of interest in relation to the items to be discussed.   1.4  No further interests were declared.   2  Independent  Review  on  the  supervisory  intervention  on  Interest  Rate  Hedging   Products   2.1  The Board was briefed on the current status of the Independent Review into the FSA and   FCA's handling of the Interest Rate Hedging Products redress scheme (the Review). It was   noted the Review was continuing and that the draft executive summary had not yet been   received. Two sets of representations had been made on behalf of the FCA. The Board was   reminded that it was originally envisaged that the review report would be published in July,   although it now appeared publication would likely be delayed.   Page 1 of 7   FCA Board  21 & 22 July 2021   3  The FCA's approach to firms' operational resilience   3.1  Following an introduction from the Executive Director of Markets, the Board was briefed on   the FCA’s maturing regulatory approach to firms’ operational resilience, including its work   with other authorities.   3.2  The Board considered the challenges posed by the growing dependency on non-regulated   third party suppliers and how the FCA’s  powers could  be  applied  to  promote operational   resilience throughout the total supply chain of firms.  The metrics required to monitor firm   resilience and support proactive supervisory engagement were also discussed.   3.3  The Board supported the work underway but sought to better understand how the FCA’s   resources are prioritised between and across sectors and the development of accompanying   metrics.   4  Report from the Chief Executive   4.1  Mr Rathi briefed the Board on a number of topical issues, including:   i.  Staffing  &  resourcing:  The  challenges  of  the  labour  market  following  the  easing  of   government restrictions and the importance of the career and grading project and the   offer of a competitive employee value proposition.  A more agile approach to recruitment   was also being explored.   ii.  Financial & operational performance: The suite of documents published on 15 July 2021   including  the  Business  Plan  2021-22  and  Annual  Report  &  Accounts  2020-21.  In   monitoring delivery of the business plan the Board was keen to explore the early warning   signs  and  suitable  metrics  to  be  incorporated  into  ongoing  Board  reporting  on  key   consumer issues and enforcement activity.   iii.  Engagement with international policy makers:  The Board was keen to understand more   fully the FCA’s engagement with international policy makers on key strategic issues.   iv.  BetIndex Review: The Board requested sight of the FCA’s response to the Reviewer’s   request for documents and noted that the firm was never regulated by the FCA.   4.2  The Board welcomed the evolving format of the report, subject to the implementation of   some additional suggestions, and recognised the breadth of the work being undertaken.   5  Report from the PRA   5.1  Mr Woods briefed the Board on the business of the PRA that was of relevance to the FCA,   including the recent publication of the Review of Ethnic Diversity and Inclusion at the Bank   (the Review).   5.2  Board members expressed an interest in ensuring that the lessons learned from the Review   were applied to the FCA as applicable.   Page 2 of 7   FCA Board  21 & 22 July 2021   6  BTS Quarterly Update   6.1  The  Board  was  briefed  on  run  and  service  updates,  key  updates  to  the  major  projects   portfolio and progress in relation to cyber security.   6.2  The Board considered the remaining risks associated with the Data Centre Exit and  was   assured that progress was being closely supervised to ensure delivery.  The inherent risks   associated  with  data  held  by  the  organisation  were also  discussed  as were  the  multiple   workstreams in train to mitigate cyber threats.  The Board sought assurance that these were   sufficiently prioritised and resourced.   6.3  The Board  was briefed  on  proposals to increase the  spend  limits for  the  Salesforce and   Computacenter contracts to accommodate the future growth of the platform and changes to   the scope and volume of run activity respectively.  The Board sought assurance regarding   the internal governance of this additional funding and that any accompanying risks or legal   implications were being appropriately managed.   6.4  In follow up, the Board   approved   the following:   i.  an increase to the Board approved spend limit for the Salesforce contract.   ii.  to delegate authority to the Executive Operations Committee (EOC) to govern spend   against the Salesforce contract.   iii.  an increase to the Board approved spend limit for the Computacenter contract.   7  Transformation   7.1  The Board was briefed on the status of the Transformation Programme, progress regarding   the career and grading project and associated communications and engagement plans.   7.2  Transformation  Programme  (the  Programme):  Whilst  the  Programme  was  noted  to  be   progressing  well,  the  Board  discussed  the  challenge  of  integrating  internal  and  external   communications  and  ensuring  that  individual  issues  do  not  drown  out  the  wider   transformation  message.  The  importance  of  sharing  the  successes  as  the  Programme   progressed was recognised in this regard.   7.3  Career & grading project (the Project):  The Chair of the Remuneration Committee briefed   the Board on its discussions of the Project, highlighting the importance of a holistic employee   value proposition.   7.4  The Board was also updated on the activities undertaken as part of the culture workstream   and  how  the  insights  gathered  were  being  fed  back  into  the  wider  Programme.  The   importance  of  the  Senior  Leadership  Team  (SLT)  in  fostering  the  cultural  change  being   sought was considered.   7.5  The Board discussed the risks associated with the Project but was supportive of the current   direction of travel.  The Board encouraged the use of examples to illustrate how proposals   Page 3 of 7   FCA Board   7.6   7.7   8   8.1   8.2   8.3   9   9.1   9.2   21 & 22 July 2021   respond  to  existing  people issues.  The importance  of  simple  and  clear  communications   confirming what would and would not be in the scope of the planned staff consultation was   also considered.   Communications & engagement: The two-way nature of communication and engagement   was  discussed  to  ensure  the  organisation  is  listening  to  and  seeking  to  understand  the   concerns  of  staff.  The  Board  emphasised  the  critical  role  of  the  SLT  and  the  Staff   Consultative Committee (SCC) in these activities and the importance of ensuring they have   sufficient capacity, capability and support to deliver this role.  The Board encouraged the use   of examples to illustrate how transformation initiatives will create opportunities and benefits   for staff and make the FCA a better regulator.   The Board was keen to be kept regularly updated about the progress of and reactions to the   Transformation Programme and the staff consultation.   British Steel Pension Scheme (BSPS)   The Board was briefed on the specific circumstances surrounding the British Steel Pension   Scheme (BSPS) and the FCA’s activity to date to support members who received unsuitable   advice from authorised financial  advice firms.  The case for further intervention and the   available options for securing redress for Scheme members were also considered.   The Board discussed the benefits and risks of these options and considered the additional   information that would be required to enable decisions to be taken about whether any further   redress proposals should be pursued and the importance of any such proposals being rooted   in the organisation’s strategic objectives.  It was noted that the Board did not currently have   sufficient information to take any such decisions.   In  the  meantime,  the  Board    supported    enhanced  engagement  activities  with  BSPS   members whilst file reviews are conducted to establish a more detailed evidence base on   which to make future decisions.  The Board also   supported   initiating discussions with the   Government about the issues with associated government policy.   Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs)   The Board was briefed on the consultation responses and subsequent proposals to amend   the Listing Rules for special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs).  The responses were   noted to represent a good proportion of the market and were generally supportive of the   proposals which sought to enhance consumer protection and market integrity by offering an   alternative to the presumption of suspension.   Where  feedback  had  been  received  this  had  been  considered  resulting  in  the  following   modifications:   i.  Lowering the minimum amount a SPAC would need to raise at initial listing from £200M   to £100M; and   ii.  Introducing an option to extend the proposed two-year time-limited operating period   (or three-year period if extended with shareholder approval) by six months, without the   need to get shareholder approval.  The additional six months will only be available in   Page 4 of 7   FCA Board  21 & 22 July 2021   limited circumstances and is intended to provide more time for a SPAC to conclude a   reverse takeover where a transaction is well advanced.   9.3  The Board discussed the proposed plans to manage the listings gateway and supported a   robust approach.  The Board considered the risks arising from the misalignment of promoter   incentives and shareholder interests and the importance of clear and reliable disclosure and   acquisition  documentation.  The  Board  sought  assurance  that  the  FCA  will  proactively   monitor these risks and take appropriate action where necessary.   10  Rules and Guidance and Technical Standards to be determined   10.1  The Board    resolved    to approve in principle the making of the following instrument and   agreed that it be made at a future date:   i.

Good job, you've read 3 articles today!  Spin the wheel now  Let's go!  SAN SALVADOR (REUTERS) - El Salvador on Tuesday (Sept 7) became the first country to adopt bitcoin as legal tender, although it suffered teething problems when the government had to unplug a digital wallet to cope with demand.  President Nayib Bukele, who pushed for adoption of the cryptocurrency, called for help from users who had already downloaded the government-backed app, to test if it was now working properly.  ""Could you please try to register and post in the comments if there are any errors or if the whole process works fine?"" the president wrote on Twitter.  Bukele said using bitcoin will help Salvadorans save US$400 million (S$540 million) a year on commissions for remittances, while giving access to financial services to those with no bank account.  Carlos Garcia, who went to a booth giving out advice on the new currency at a shopping mall on Tuesday to learn about how transactions would work, was excited about the opportunities bitcoin could provide.  ""El Salvador is taking a great step forward today,"" he said.  However, the poorest may struggle to access the technology needed to make bitcoin work in El Salvador, where nearly half the population has no internet and many more only have sporadic access.  ""I'm going to continue suffering with or without bitcoin,"" said sweet-seller Jose Herrera, who said he had trouble accessing a mobile phone.  Others say the move may fuel money laundering and financial instability. It has already muddied the outlook for more than US$1 billion in financing that El Salvador is seeking from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).  Bukele, 40, is Latin America's most popular leader but has been accused of eroding democracy, not least by the administration of US President Joe Biden.  Last week, top judges appointed by his lawmakers ruled that he could serve a second term.  Earlier on Tuesday, Salvadorans trying to download the Chivo digital wallet, which the government has promoted, promising US$30 of bitcoin for each user, found it was unavailable on popular app stores.  Then Bukele tweeted that the government had temporarily unplugged it, in order to connect more servers to deal with demand.  Bukele blamed Apple, Google and Huawei's app download platforms for the delay.  ""Release him! @Apple @Google and @Huawei,"" Bukele wrote in one of his tweets, which was accompanied by a red-faced ""angry""emoji.  The wallet was later available from Huawei.  Google and Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Bitcoin beach  Polls indicate Salvadorans are wary of the volatility of the cryptocurrency, which can shed hundreds of dollars in value in a day.  Ahead of the launch, El Salvador bought 400 bitcoins worth around US$20 million, Bukele said, helping drive the price of the currency above US$52,000 for the first time since May.  Hours later, however, bitcoin had weakened and last traded down 8.84 per cent at US$47,327.32.  El Salvador beach town hopes to ride bitcoin wave  Ethereum, another crypto currency, fell 10.52 per cent to US$3,537.62, while crypto exchange Coinbase Global slid 3.96 per cent after reporting delays in some transactions on its platform.  The change means businesses should accept payment in bitcoin alongside the US dollar, which has been El Salvador's official currency since 2001 and will remain legal tender.  It remains unclear whether businesses will be penalised if they do not accept bitcoin.  In the run-up to the launch, the government installed ATMs that allow bitcoin to be converted into dollars and withdrawn without commission from the digital wallet, called Chivo.  ""Like all innovations, El Salvador's bitcoin process has a learning curve,"" Bukele tweeted. ""Not everything will be achieved in a day, or in a month.""  Levers of power  In barely two years in office, Bukele has taken control of almost all levers of power. But although he has promised to clean up graft, the Biden administration recently put some of his close allies on a corruption blacklist.  Analysts fear that the adoption of bitcoin, whose transaction records are distributed across the internet, beyond the reach of national jurisdictions, could fuel money laundering.  Families wary as El Salvador adopts bitcoin  After the bitcoin law was approved, the rating agency Moody's downgraded El Salvador's creditworthiness, while its dollar-denominated bonds have also come under pressure.  Bukele, who does not shy away from controversy, on Monday retweeted a video that showed his face superimposed on actor Jaime Foxx's body in a scene from Django Unchained, a Quentin Tarantino film about American slavery. The video portrayed Bukele whipping a slave trader who had the IMF emblem emblazoned on his face.  Bukele later deleted the retweet.  In his own tweet, Bukele said: ""We must break the paradigms of the past. El Salvador has the right to advance towards the first world."""
European Banking Authority,EBA draft guidelines on PSD2 limited network exclusion - for consultation,Lexology | European Union,Lexology,"EBA draft guidelines on PSD2 limited network exclusion - for consultation  Blog post by: Contributor: Bird & Bird LLP  Summary: On 15 July 2021, the EBA published Draft Guidelines on the PSD2 limited network exclusion (Article 3(k) PSD2 - LNE) - see here. The guidelines are  On 15 July 2021, the EBA published draft guidelines on the PSD2 limited network exclusion (Article 3(k) PSD2 – LNE) – see here. The guidelines are addressed at national competent authorities (NCAs) and are meant to help them in ensuring a consistent enforcement of the LNE exclusion throughout the EU.  The guidelines are open for comments until 15 October 2021 – we strongly recommend to companies that are relying, or intend to rely, on that exclusion to review the draft guidelines in detail and consider submitting comments. In our view, the draft guidelines contain several controversial comments, as well as a number of issues, that are not clarified by the EBA’s draft.  The EBA has also organised a (remote) public hearing on 8 September 2021 which you can register for here.  Whilst we cannot summarise the entire draft guidelines, we will address the purpose of them, highlight below some of the helpful clarifications that they contain, as well as some controversial statements, and (in our view) missing items.  Why is the EBA drafting guidelines?  Article 3(k) PSD2 is typically referred to as the “limited network exclusion” (or exemption), but in fact hosts three similar, but different, exclusions from the scope of PSD2:  “services based on specific payment instruments that can be used only in a limited way, that meet one of the following conditions:  (i)instruments allowing the holder to acquire goods or services only in the premises of the issuer or within a limited network of service providers under direct commercial agreement with a professional issuer; [limited network exclusion stricto sensu]  (ii)instruments which can be used only to acquire a very limited range of goods or services; [very limited range exclusion]  (iii)instruments valid only in a single Member State provided at the request of an undertaking or a public sector entity and regulated by a national or regional public authority for specific social or tax purposes to acquire specific goods or services from suppliers having a commercial agreement with the issuer; [social or tax exclusion]”  The EBA justifies the need for the guidelines by stating that “… the implementation and application of these requirements diverges significantly between Member States, thus impeding the single market for payment services in the EU and creating opportunities for regulatory arbitrage” (paragraph 5, page 7).  This reflects our own experience at Bird & Bird: the LNE exclusion is indeed being interpreted differently by different NCAs throughout the EU, as well as in the UK which still has the same exclusion in its national payments regulations. Therefore, any attempt at harmonising the enforcement of that exclusion is welcomed – although:  as mentioned below, we have identified some initial issues with the draft EBA guidelines  the same issue of inconsistent enforcement also holds true in relation to other PSD2 exclusions such as the commercial agent exemption (interpreted and enforced more strictly in some EU countries), the payment systems exclusion (that has been implemented differently in the laws of different EU Member States, but also seems to be enforced differently). This begs the question whether the EBA will also prepare draft guidelines on those other PSD2 exclusions that also suffer the same issue?  Specific payment instrument  As mentioned above, the brief LNE exclusions in PSD2 (together with recital 13 and 14 PSD2 that are meant to provide more colour to Article 3(k) PSD2), as well the notification requirement that applies when the transactions with the alleged excluded payment instruments exceeds a certain threshold, raise a number of issues of interpretation and therefore legal uncertainty. The EBA has provided the below clarifications:  “specific payment instruments” in the LNE are “payment instruments” within the meaning of Article 4(14) PSD2 (i.e. “a personalised device(s) and/or set of procedures agreed between the payment service user and the payment service provider and used in order to initiate a payment order”) (guideline 1.1).  The specific payment instrument can be used to purchase both physical and digital goods/services (guideline 1.2 – see also paragraph 9 on page 8).  How funds are transferred to the payment instrument is irrelevant to the assessment on whether the instrument falls, or not, within the LNE (guideline 1.3 – see also paragraph 10 on page 8).  Specific provisions in the T&Cs regarding the use of the excluded payment instrument are not enough to benefit from the LNE. Instead, both technical and contractual restrictions are required for a payment instrument to potentially benefit from the LNE (guideline 1.4 – see also paragraph 12 on page 8), with a minimum set of technical restrictions listed in guideline 1.5.  More than one payment instrument benefitting from the LNE can be accommodated on the same (card-based) means of payment (guideline 1.6 – see also paragraph 13 on page 9[1]). However the EBA would not allow a regulated instrument and a payment service exempted under the LNE to be combined on the same (card-based) means of payment as users may be confused as to whether or not they are protected under PSD2 when using this or that instrument (guideline 1.7 – see also paragraphs 13-14 on page 9). In other words, if a specific (perhaps card-based) means of payment contains two separate payment instruments, it is not possible for only one of them to benefit from the LNE: either both of them should benefit, or none of them will benefit.  Redeemability of the monetary value stored on the payment instrument is not a factor in the assessment of whether the conditions for LNE are met (guideline 1.9 – see also paragraph 17 on page 9).  Both reloadable and non-reloadable instruments can benefit from the LNE (guideline 1.10 – see also paragraph 18 on page 9).  The exclusions stated in Article 3(k) are mutually exclusive, so cannot be applied together. Therefore, the service provider should decide which exclusion under Article 3(k) PSD2 is the leading one. Also, the LNE cannot be combined with another PSD2 exclusion (guideline 1.11 – see also paragraphs 20-21 on page 10, and paragraph 68 on pages 19-20).  The issuer of the payment instrument can be established in a Member State different from that of the jurisdiction where the services are being provided, and therefore where a notification is made (guideline 1.12 – see also paragraph 19 on page 10).  While not addressed in the actual guidelines, the EBA clarified in the consultation document that:  Credit may be provided in relation to transactions carried out with instruments excluded under the LNE (subject to relevant national legal requirements related to the provision of credit of course) – paragraph 11 on page 8.  The LNE applies to the services provided, not to the service provider, pursuant to the wording of Article 3(k) PSD2 (see paragraph 15 on page 9).  A single service provider can offer more than one instrument falling within the scope of the LNE (guideline 8 – see also paragraph 16 on page 9).  Limited network stricto sensu (Article 3(k)(i) PSD2)  Limited network of services providers  In order to determine if a network of service providers is sufficiently limited to benefit from the exclusion, the EBA has retained four defining criteria, applicable to all business models (including physical stores, online stores, or a combination of both – see guideline 2.1):  Whether a contractual agreement exists between the issuer and the merchants for the acceptance of the excluded instrument. The EBA considers that for the criterion to be met, the direct contractual agreement will have to be concluded between the professional issuer and each individual merchant within the limited network. This is without prejudice to the possibility of delegating the conclusion of the contract to a third party acting on behalf of either the professional issuer or the individual merchants (see guideline 2.6 – see also paragraph 28 on page 12, and paragraph 38 on pages 13-14).  Specific restrictions on the use of the instruments within a LNE to limit the growth of the networks, such as caps on the number of providers or goods and services offered. In case the limited network expands over time beyond the envisaged number, a new notification with updated information would need to be submitted to the relevant NCA(s) (paragraph 26 on page 12).  Geographical area: the EBA considers this a flexible approach as it leaves it to the provider of an excluded service to decide on the specific geographical area for provision of goods and services, and then to indicate and justify it in the description of the activity provided with the notification under Article 37(2) of PSD2 (paragraphs 24-25 on pages 11-12).  If a common brand is used that characterises the limited network: to ensure customer (consumer) protection, it should be clear to the customer that the service providers operates under a certain brand, preferably by having some visual manifestation (paragraph 29 on page 12).  Some additional optional indicators can be taken into account by CAs in their assessment of a specific business model (but are not defining criteria applicable to all business models) – see guideline 2.2., as well as paragraph 22 on page 11 and paragraph 34 on page 13.  Payment instruments under the LNE can only be used within a single limited network (see guideline 2.5 – see also paragraph 37 on page 12, as well as recital 13 PSD2).  While acknowledging that by default all exclusions under PSD2 should be applied in a restrictive manner, the EBA still specified in guideline 2.7 that CAs should apply the criteria and indicators under guidelines 2.1 and 2.2 in a restrictive way, i.e. that does not allow for the possibility of a specific-purpose instrument to develop into a general-purpose instrument (see paragraph 39 on page 14).  Instruments used within the premises of the issuer  In relation to “instruments allowing the holder to acquire goods or services only in the premises of the issuer”, the EBA is taking the view that the reference to “premises” sets out a geographical restriction to physical location(s). This means that payment instruments benefitting from this exclusion can only be used for purchases within physical locations and cannot be used for purchases in online stores (see guideline 3 – as well as paragraph 40 on page 14).  This is arguably taking a restrictive interpretation of the word “premises”. Granted the EBA cannot amend the wording of PSD2 nor the national legislations implementing it (it is merely issuing non-binding interpretative guidance to NCAs), but this interpretation has the potential to create a discrimination between brick-and-mortar stores and online stores.  Very limited range of goods and services (Article 3(k)(ii) PSD2)  Recital 13 PSD2 refers to “functionality connected goods and services”. The EBA therefore focuses in its draft guidelines on the identification of a relationship between a leading product/service and connected goods and/or services (see guidelines 4.1 to 4.3 included – see also paragraph 46 on page 15).  It also provides additional indicators in guideline 4.4, which are identical to the additional indicators in guideline 2.2 (see above) except for the “size of the geographical area for provision of goods and services” indicator which has been removed.  The EBA indicates again that the requirements of guideline 4 should be applied by CAs in a restrictive way that does not allow for the possibility a specific-purpose instrument to develop into a general-purpose instrument and thus falling outside the scope of the LNE (paragraph 49 on page 16).  Provision of services under LNE by regulated entities  Not only unregulated players can benefit from the LNE, but also regulated players (e.g. banks, payment institutions, e-money institutions) can benefit from the LNE exclusion in relation to some of their services (see guideline 5.1). However those regulated players should ensure a proper delineation between their regulated and non-regulated services so that PSUs, in particular consumers, are aware that they do not benefit from the protections PSD2 provides to regulated services (e.g. different brands, perhaps separate legal entities – guidelines 5.2 and 5.3, as well as paragraphs 50-53 on pages 16-17).  Notification requirements  Regarding the notification requirements:  The thresholds should be calculated at the level of each Member State (guideline 6.1 – see also paragraph 56 on page 17). Therefore, the respective payment instrument should be notified to, and assessed by, the respective CA(s) where the services are provided individually and where the thresholds set out in Article 37(2) of PSD2 have been exceeded (guideline 6.1 – see also paragraph 57 on page 18).  There are no regulatory obstacles to the provision of cross-border services based on an instrument excluded under Article 3(k)(i) or (ii) of PSD2. However, since these are services excluded from the application of PSD2, the service providers cannot benefit from passporting rights and subsequently cannot be passported in another Member States based on an assessment carried out by the CA of the ‘home’ Member State where the provider is carrying out its activity (guideline 6.1 – see also paragraph 55 on page 17). Although as a practical matter, it would be obviously problematic to the concept of single market if we saw two or more NCAs reach contradicting conclusions in relation to the same services. Therefore, while not required by the EBA (see paragraph 59 on page 18), one can only hope that CAs will coordinate in order to reach a consistent view.  For the information to be included in the notification, see guidelines 6.2 and 6.3 (see also paragraph 58 page 18).  The notification should be submitted only once (i.e. no need for annual resubmission which is a practice that had developed in some EU Member States such as Italy and France) (guideline 6.4 – see also paragraph 63 on page 19). A new notification is only required if the information provided in the original notification changed substantially or if another specific payment instrument is envisaged – see guideline 6.5 for factors that may constitute a significant change.  “the calculation of the thresholds … is to be carried out at the level of each service provider” (guideline 6.7), meaning that while a single provider can benefit from the LNE exclusion in relation to several services (see guideline 1.8, as well as paragraph 16 on page 9 and paragraph 61 on page 18), the value of the transactions made across those separate specific payment instrument should be added in order to determine if the notification threshold is reached or not (i.e. each specific payment instrument does not benefit from a separate “counter”) – see guideline 6.7. This is potentially controversial and no doubt will give rise to comments. Also, this approach seems to somewhat contradict the statement made by the EBA in point 15 on page 9 that, pursuant to the wording of Article 3(k) PSD2, the LNE applies to the services provided, not to the service provider?  Article 3(k)(iii)  The EBA did not find merit in providing more clarity on the exclusion under Article 3(k)(iii) of PSD2 since the specific aspects on the use of the instrument, including its funding, are specified in the respective national social or tax law (paragraph 69 on page 20). The EBA merely stated that “Competent authorities should not require the instruments falling in the scope of Article 3(k)(iii) of PSD2 to fulfil the requireme"

Basel III,EU bank watchdogs warn on industry plans to soften regulations,American Banker | Regulation,American Banker,"EU bank watchdogs warn on industry plans to soften regulations  European bank regulators issued a joint warning against watering down tough new capital requirements, after the industry seized on the pandemic to lobby for less onerous rules.  European bank regulators issued a joint warning against watering down tough new capital requirements, after the industry seized on the pandemic to lobby for less onerous rules.  Twenty-five central banks and watchdogs from across the region sent a letter to the European Commission on Tuesday calling for a “full, timely and consistent implementation” of global standards known as Basel III.  The package is about to enter a decisive phase in Europe with the commission’s proposal for how to translate it into law due before the end of the year.  Regulators across the globe vowed after the financial crisis of 2008 to force banks to hold much bigger capital buffers, so the industry would never again need to rely on taxpayer-funded bailouts. Since the pandemic, however, banks have argued that softer capital demands would help them provide more credit to businesses pummeled by lockdowns.  But regulators say the COVID-19 crisis has underscored the need for a well-capitalized bank sector. “The pandemic shows that more resilient banks are better able to support the real economy, even during times of crisis. Diluting the framework would not be in the best interests of Europe.”  Mairead McGuinness, the European commissioner for financial services, said the region has to implement Basel III “in a faithful way” because it is part of the global banking system.  “I think our banks understand why implementing is important but equally we are very clear, and we have been given political direction, that we have to be conscious of where we are today post-COVID,” she told reporters. The economy is “still in a phase of transition perhaps” which highlights “the importance of not pushing an increase in capital requirements immediately on the banking system.”"

Basel IV,CHRISTIAN SEWING : Three theses for answering Europe's banking and capital markets challenges,MarketScreener.com | Companies,MarketScreener,"CHRISTIAN SEWING : Three theses for answering Europe's banking and capital markets challenges  Christian Sewing speech at Handelsblatt Banking Summit 2021  Ladies and gentlemen,  it is a pleasure for me to speak at this banking summit again. This year, for the first time, I am speaking to you from London, where many of our largest institutional clients have gathered together again at last. This means we're returning to a little bit of normality. And it's an indication that we are gradually emerging from the pandemic.  You can interpret the fact that I no longer want to talk about how we can get out of this crisis as quickly as possible as another indication of that. Instead, I want to look far into the distance. What are the big trends and factors that will shape the banking industry in the next decade? And what do we need to do to emerge from this upheaval as winners?  There is a consensus, ladies and gentlemen, that our economy must become more digital and more sustainable. This transformation, driven by technology, will be just as fundamental in nature as the first industrial revolution more than two centuries ago. Back then, humanity began burning carbon on a large scale. In this century, it will have to largely stop doing that if we want to avoid a catastrophe. Leading scientists agree on that.  At the same time, the stakes for Europe are high. This decade will decide who will dominate the global economy in the 21st century. And Europe will have to pull out all the stops to avoid being one of the losers.  Yet we have already fallen behind in the past 20 years. In 2000, 41 of the 100 most valuable listed companies in the world still came from Europe. Now only 15 of them do. What applies to the economy as a whole is also reflected in the financial sector. At the turn of the millennium, the 25 largest European banks had a similar stock market value to that of the 25 largest US banks. Today, JP Morgan and the Bank of America alone are worth as much as the 18 largest European banks together.  And I will put forward the proposition that there is probably more than just one correlation between this relative decline in the value of our financial sector and our companies as a whole. Because I am convinced that an efficient banking and capital market was and is one of the great location advantages of the United States. That means that, in order to catch up again, Europe also needs a stronger banking and capital market. Otherwise, we will not be able to hold our own in a global economy polarised between the US and China.  Why not? Because without a strong financial sector we (a) cannot mobilise enough capital and (b) even more seriously, we cannot channel it efficiently.  What do we have to do?  First and foremost, it is up to the banks themselves - and the industry is on the right track. Overall, financial institutions in Germany have not only become much more stable and robust since the financial crisis, but the industry is also making progress on profitability at last.  Our progress in transforming Deutsche Bank is a case in point. In the first six months of the year, we achieved a pre-tax profit of 2.8 billion euros and a return on tangible equity of 6.5 per cent, our best half-year since 2015. And in our core bank, i.e. the business areas we want to continue, we doubled our pre-tax result to 3.4 billion euros and achieved a return of 9.3 per cent. That was already in line with our target for the coming year. I remain optimistic that we will sustainably achieve our goals for 2022.  But that alone will not be enough if we want to be up there with the top players. The big banks in Europe also need to set a fundamental course, which I would like to link to three propositions.  Firstly: there will only be a few major global banks left.  And that means: we must finally make use of Europe's economies of scale. It was and remains right to regulate big banks particularly carefully. In Europe, however, we have also done a great deal to ensure that banks no longer get big. But this is a questionable course. After all, the importance of size in the financial world is increasing exponentially.  Because in future only large banks will be able to...  - ...combine a global network with deep local roots.  - ...raise the necessary investments to become more digital and offer holistic advice at the same time.  - Only they will still be able to leverage efficiency gains in the face of continuing cost pressure...  - ...and only they will eliminate the capital market deficit in Europe.  It cannot be in our interests if all those global banks have their headquarters outside Europe. In an increasingly fragmented world dominated by national interests, we would make ourselves even more dependent on US banks. After the experience of recent years, we would be making a strategic mistake, that would not be in Germany's and Europe's interest.  What is to be done given the discrepancies in stock market value? By doing what the European economy as a whole urgently needs. We need to further strengthen the single market in Europe as quickly as possible, especially in services. This also includes a banking and capital markets union. We can no longer afford to follow an evolutionary path; we need a big leap forward. This will also accelerate the overdue consolidation across national borders.  Secondly: regulation must be fair  The banking and capital markets union is a necessary but not sufficient condition for a strong financial sector in Europe. To achieve this, we must also finally create a level playing field.  This applies to capital regulations that do not sufficiently take European economic structures into account - keyword Basel IV. This applies to the securitisation market, which in Europe is only one tenth the size of the US market, also because of regulatory barriers. This would be an important lever for creating room for manoeuvre in bank balance sheets and thus helping the financing of the economy.  But this also applies to unequal conditions for banks and non-banks, even when looking at similar services. The regulatory imbalance in the competition with fintechs or big techs is just one example. Another is the unequal struggle between banks and other financial groups. In the face of persistently negative interest rates, institutional investors are chasing higher returns and are pushing into credit markets that were traditionally the preserve of banks. Even insurers have suddenly become very active in leveraged loans, although they are not subject to the same regulation as banks. This shows that if European banks are subjected to increasingly restrictive regulation, the business will not disappear; it will simply migrate to other financial sectors.  We may also see completely new constellations in the consolidation of the financial sector in the future. However, these would be primarily driven by regulation. This would further undermine the highly controlled banking system while business is done elsewhere. No one can seriously want that. This promotes neither financial stability nor fair competition. Same business, same regulation: that must be the principle.  Thirdly: sustainability will pick the winners and losers  The fight against climate change is probably the greatest challenge facing humanity, and we banks will have to fundamentally align ourselves with it. Right now. But this is not only a duty, it is also an opportunity. Or let me put it this way. I believe that ESG, i.e. banking according to strict environmental, social and governance criteria, is the biggest growth topic for decades.  Why? Because huge investments will be needed to transform our economy. According to current estimates, over two trillion euros will be needed worldwide every year until 2050. According to calculations by Autonomous, this would mean that the banking sector's total annual financing volume would be 15 per cent higher than today.  The prospects that we Europeans will be able to account for a large share of this are good. Europe's economy is a leader in many areas of green technology. And the European market share in green bonds is twice as high as in the bond market as a whole.  But there is more to it than that. Sustainability is already changing banks fundamentally - and this change will accelerate even more. It starts with risk management and continues with the validation of loans, investments and transactions according to environmental, social and governance standards. And it's about our business. Sustainability has vastly increased the demand for advice from both companies and private investors. We are adapting our dialogue with our customers accordingly. We are currently spending a lot of time working out how we can best support our customers in their transformation.  The importance of this topic can be seen in the fact that I am directly responsible for it. But the increase in importance will go even further. Not only does sustainability affect each of our divisions, but it will also develop into a business field itself. This will have to be reflected in our structure if we are to realise our potential.  Ladies and gentlemen, the twenties will decide who will dominate the global economy and which path we take in the fight against climate change.  We need better conditions for this, and the course must now be set for a consolidation of our industry, for competition-neutral regulation and for more sustainability in the financial sector.  But this also means that we have to work on ourselves. Because we will only be able to take advantage of the best conditions if we also continue to change ourselves - and here I am of course talking first and foremost about our own bank. It's about culture, it's about leadership culture. It's about the purpose of what we do and about being able to explain it to society. That is also important for us to remain competitive. Because banking is shaped by people. Because dialogue with and advice for our customers must always be at the focus of our work.  That means we don't just need the best people and diverse teams. We also need to look after our colleagues and our customers much more, invest in them and see them for what they are: the most valuable asset we have. This must be the benchmark for the management of a bank.  Ladies and gentlemen, in view of the current challenges, we need a strong, globally active banking sector. Our industry is one of the key industries of a globally exporting economy like those of Germany and Europe.  So we should act accordingly now, with a clear strategy and attitude.  Thank you very much."

Self-Regulatory Organization’s Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change FINRA is proposing to (i) extend the expiration date of FINRA Rule 0180 (Application of Rules to Security-Based Swaps) to February 6, 2022 and (ii) extend to April 6, 2022 the implementation of FINRA Rule 4240 (Margin Requirements for Credit Default Swaps) and clarify that the rule does not apply if a member is registered with the SEC as a security-based swap (‘‘SBS’’) dealer (‘‘SBSD’’). The text of the proposed rule change is available on FINRA’s website at http://www.finra.org, at the principal office of FINRA and at the Commission’s Public Reference Room. II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, FINRA included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. FINRA has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change 1. Purpose On July 8, 2011, FINRA filed for immediate effectiveness FINRA Rule 0180, which, with certain exceptions, temporarily limits the application of FINRA rules with respect to SBS, thereby avoiding undue market disruptions resulting from the change to the definition of ‘‘security’’ under the 1 15 VerDate Sep<11>2014 17:21 Sep 07, 2021 3 17 Jkt 253001 PO 00000 CFR 240.19b–4(f)(6). Frm 00069 Fmt 4703 Sfmt 4703 50391 Act to expressly encompass SBS.4 Pending the SEC’s final implementation of its rulemakings under Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act,5 FINRA extended the expiration date of FINRA Rule 0180 a number of times, most recently in January 2020, when FINRA extended the expiration date to September 1, 2021.6 In addition, on May 22, 2009, the Commission approved FINRA Rule 4240,7 which implements an interim pilot program (the ‘‘Interim Pilot Program’’) with respect to margin requirements for certain transactions in credit default swaps (‘‘CDS’’).8 On June 2, 2020, FINRA filed a proposed rule change for immediate effectiveness extending the implementation of FINRA Rule 4240 to September 1, 2021.9 Therefore, both FINRA Rule 0180 and the Interim Pilot Program under FINRA Rule 4240 are currently scheduled to expire on September 1, 2021. On April 26, 2021, FINRA filed a proposed rule change to amend FINRA Rules 0180, 4120, 4210, 4220, 4240 and 9610 to clarify the application of its rules to SBS following the SEC’s completion of its rulemaking under Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act regarding SBSDs and major SBS participants (collectively, ‘‘SBS Entities’’).10 Among other things, the Proposal would adopt a new FINRA Rule 0180, to replace expiring current FINRA Rule 0180, that would generally apply FINRA rules to members’ activities and positions with respect to SBS, while providing limited exceptions for SBS in circumstances where FINRA believes such exceptions are appropriate. The Proposal would also adopt a new margin rule specifically applicable to SBS, which would replace the expiring Interim Pilot Program 4 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 64884 (July 14, 2011), 76 FR 42755 (July 19, 2011) (Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of File No. SR–FINRA–2011–033). 5 See Public Law 111–203, 124 Stat. 1376 (2010), Section 701. 6 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 88023 (January 23, 2020), 85 FR 5261 (January 29, 2020) (Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of File No. SR–FINRA–2020–001). 7 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 59955 (May 22, 2009), 74 FR 25586 (May 28, 2009) (Order Approving File No. SR–FINRA–2009–012). 8 In March 2012, the SEC approved amendments to FINRA Rule 4240 that, among other things, limit the rule’s application to CDS that are SBS. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 66527 (March 7, 2012), 77 FR 14850 (March 13, 2012) (Order Approving File No. SR–FINRA–2012–015). 9 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 89036 (June 10, 2020), 85 FR 36458 (June 16, 2020) (Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of File No. SR–FINRA–2020–016). 10 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 91789 (May 7, 2021), 86 FR 26084 (May 12, 2021) (Notice of Filing of File No. SR–FINRA–2021–008) (‘‘Proposal’’). E:\FR\FM\08SEN1.SGM 08SEN1 50392 Federal Register / Vol. 86, No. 171 / Wednesday, September 8, 2021 / Notices establishing margin requirements for CDS. FINRA originally proposed that the effective date of the Proposal would be October 6, 2021, to align with the SEC’s compliance date for registration of SBS Entities (the ‘‘Registration Compliance Date’’). FINRA noted in the Proposal that it intended to extend the expiration dates of existing FINRA Rules 0180 and 4240 to October 6, 2021 to align with the Registration Compliance Date and implementation of the Proposal.11 After consideration of comments on the Proposal, as well as further feedback from member firms, on August 9, 2021 FINRA filed Partial [sic] Amendment No. 1 to the Proposal.12 The Amendment (1) extends the effective date of the proposed amendments to FINRA Rules 0180, 4120 and 9610 from October 6, 2021 to February 6, 2022; (2) extends the effective date of the proposed amendments to FINRA Rules 4210, 4220 and 4240 from October 6, 2021 to April 6, 2022; and (3) conforms the proposed definition of ‘‘Legacy Swap’’ in proposed FINRA Rule 4240(d)(12) to reflect the new effective date of April 6, 2022. FINRA noted in the Amendment that it intended to extend the expiration date of existing FINRA Rule 0180 until February 6, 2022, and the expiration date of existing FINRA Rule 4240 until April 6, 2022, so as to align with the new effective dates of the Proposal described above.13 Accordingly, the proposed rule change (i) amends existing FINRA Rule 0180 to extend the expiration date of the rule from September 1, 2021 to February 6, 2022 and (ii) amends existing FINRA Rule 4240 to extend the expiration date of the Interim Pilot Program from September 1, 2021 to April 6, 2022. FINRA believes it is appropriate to extend the expiring rules so as to align with the effective dates of the new rules that will replace them, thereby avoiding undue burdens on market participants and undue market disruption. FINRA also noted in the Amendment that, beginning on the Registration Compliance Date, members may register with the SEC as SBSDs, and thereby become subject to the margin requirements applicable to SBSDs under Exchange Act Rule 18a–3.14 Therefore, if a member were to register as an SBSD 11 See Proposal, supra note 10, at 26086 n.18. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 92617 (August 9, 2021), 86 FR 44761 (August 13, 2021) (Notice of Filing of Amendment No. 1 and Order Instituting Proceedings To Determine Whether To Approve or Disapprove the Proposed Rule Change, as Modified by Amendment No. 1, Relating to Security-Based Swaps) (‘‘Amendment’’). 13 See supra note 12. 14 See supra note 12. jbell on DSKJLSW7X2PROD with NOTICES 12 See VerDate Sep<11>2014 17:21 Sep 07, 2021 Jkt 253001 on the Registration Compliance Date or during the period between the Registration Compliance Date and April 6, 2022, the member would be subject to both the new margin requirements for SBS under Exchange Act Rule 18a–3 and the expiring Interim Pilot Program for CDS. In order to avoid unnecessary regulatory duplication or any potential conflicting obligations as between Exchange Act Rule 18a–3 and the Interim Pilot Program, FINRA is also amending existing, expiring FINRA Rule 4240 to add Supplementary Material .02 to clarify that the rule does not apply to a member that is registered with the SEC as an SBSD.15 FINRA has filed the proposed rule change for immediate effectiveness and has requested that the SEC waive the requirement that the proposed rule change not become operative for 30 days after the date of the filing, so FINRA can implement the proposed rule change on September 1, 2021. 2. Statutory Basis FINRA believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the provisions of Section 15A(b)(6) of the Act,16 which requires, among other things, that FINRA rules must be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. FINRA believes that the proposed rule change would further the purposes of the Act because the proposed rule change will help to avoid undue burdens on market participants and undue market disruption that could result if existing FINRA Rule 0180 expires before the effective date of new FINRA Rule 0180. Similarly, FINRA believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the Act because extending the implementation of FINRA Rule 4240 will ensure that the Interim Pilot Program establishing margin requirements for CDS will continue to apply until the new SBS margin rule under new FINRA Rule 4240 becomes effective, thereby helping to promote stability in the financial markets and regulatory certainty for members. FINRA further believes that clarifying that the Interim Pilot Program does not apply to a registered SBSD will promote 15 FINRA notes that this provision is consistent with the new SBS margin rule under the Proposal, which provides that a member that is registered as an SBSD shall instead comply with Exchange Act Rule 18a–3. As discussed in the Proposal, FINRA believes it should defer to the SEC’s margin framework for registered SBSDs rather than impose additional or different requirements on such entities. See Proposal, supra note 10, at 26098. 16 15 U.S.C. 78o–3(b)(6). PO 00000 Frm 00070 Fmt 4703 Sfmt 4703 legal certainty and avoid unnecessary regulatory duplication. B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s Statement on Burden on Competition FINRA does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. FINRA believes that the proposed rule change would prevent undue burdens on market participants and undue market disruption that would otherwise result if FINRA Rule 0180 expires before the effective date of new FINRA Rule 0180. FINRA believes that, by extending the expiration of FINRA Rule 0180, the proposed rule change will serve to promote regulatory clarity and consistency, thereby reducing burdens on the marketplace and facilitating investor protection. Similarly, FINRA believes that extending the implementation of the Interim Pilot Program under FINRA Rule 4240 will ensure that the Interim Pilot Program establishing margin requirements for CDS will continue to apply until the new SBS margin rule under new FINRA Rule 4240 becomes effective, thereby helping to promote stability in the financial markets and regulatory certainty for members. FINRA further believes that clarifying that the Interim Pilot Program does not apply to a registered SBSD will promote legal certainty and avoid unnecessary regulatory duplication. C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others Written comments were neither solicited nor received. III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action Because the foregoing proposed rule change does not: (i) Significantly affect the protection of investors or the public interest; (ii) impose any significant burden on competition; and (iii) become operative for 30 days from the date on which it was filed, or such shorter time as the Commission may designate, it has become effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act 17 and Rule 19b– 4(f)(6) thereunder.18 A proposed rule change filed under Rule 19b–4(f)(6) normally does not become operative prior to 30 days after the date of the filing. However, pursuant 17 15 18 17 E:\FR\FM\08SEN1.SGM U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A).

FINRA has requested that the Commission waive the 30-day operative delay requirement so that the proposed rule change may become operative on September 1, 2021. The Commission hereby grants the request. The proposed rule change is consistent "

Wu, 2021 NY Slip Op 4902 – NY: Appellate Div., 2nd Dept. 2021:  “….The defendants contend that the foreclosing plaintiff in this case meets the foregoing definition of “debt collection agency.” We disagree, for the reasons that follow.  Initially, Real Property Actions and Proceedings Law article 13, which governs mortgage foreclosure actions, distinguishes between an action to recover any part of the mortgage debt and an action to foreclose the mortgage (see RPAPL 1301). “An action to foreclose a mortgage is not an action to recover the mortgage debt from the mortgagor personally, but to collect it out of the land by enforcing the lien of the mortgage” (Jamaica Sav. Bank v M.S. Inv. Co., 274 NY 215, 219 [internal quotation marks omitted]; see 1 Bergman on New York Mortgage Foreclosures § 2.02 [2021]). Thus, the foreclosure action is properly characterized as an action to enforce a security interest in property, rather than to collect money directly from a debtor (see 1 Bergman on New York Mortgage Foreclosures § 2.02; see also Vien-Phuong Thi Ho v ReconTrust Co., NA, 858 F3d 568, 571-573 [9th Cir]).  In any case, to the extent a mortgage foreclosure action constitutes debt collection (cf. Obduskey v McCarthy & Holthus LLP, ___ US ___, ___, 139 S Ct 1029, 1033-1034), the plaintiff was not a “debt collection agency” (Administrative Code § 20-489[a]). As reflected above, the Administrative Code first defines “debt collection agency” as: “a person engaged in business the principal purpose of which is to regularly collect or attempt to collect debts owed or due or asserted to be owed or due to another” (id. ). Since the plaintiff is the owner of the subject note, its foreclosure action does not constitute an “attempt to collect debts owed or due or asserted to be owed or due to another” (id. [emphasis added]; see Henson v Santander Consumer USA Inc., ___ US ___, ___, 137 S Ct 1718, 1721-1722 [likewise interpreting the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (15 USC § 1692a[6]), a similar provision of federal law]; Pirrelli v OCWEN Loan Servicing, LLC, 129 AD3d 689, 693; Citibank [S.D.] N.A. v Sablic, 55 AD3d 651, 653; Doherty v Citibank [South Dakota] N.A., 375 F Supp 2d 158, 161-162 [ED NY]).  The definition of “debt collection agency” also includes “a buyer of delinquent debt who seeks to collect such debt” (Administrative Code § 20-489[a]). Although the plaintiff here obtained the note after the defendants were allegedly in default, the plaintiff also does not qualify as a “debt collection agency” under this expanded definition. First, the language of Administrative Code § 20-489(a) is ambiguous in the sense that it is unclear whether the requirement that the “principal purpose” of the business be the collection of debt is intended to apply to the entire, expanded definition of “debt collection agency,” or only to the first part of the definition pertaining to the collection of debts owed to another. To the extent the “principal purpose” requirement also applies to the expanded definition of “a buyer of delinquent debt who seeks to collect such debt,” the defendants did not show, or even attempt to argue, that it is the “principal purpose” of the plaintiff, Citibank, N.A., to buy and collect delinquent debt. Thus, to the extent that the “principal purpose” requirement modifies the entire definition of “debt collection agency,” the plaintiff would not fit within that definition.  In any event, even if the “principal purpose” requirement is not applicable and the literal language of the expanded definition of “debt collection agency” covered an owner of a note acquired after default, who is pursuing judicial mortgage foreclosure, we conclude that such a literal interpretation does not reflect the legislative intent of the relevant Administrative Code provisions. “[W]e are not bound to accord a literal interpretation to a statutory definition if to do so would lead to an unreasonable result or defeat the general purpose and manifest policy intended to be promoted” (Matter of Capital Newspapers, Div. of Hearst Corp. v Whalen, 69 NY2d 246, 252).  The legislative declaration accompanying the relevant Administrative Code provisions explains that the New York City Council was concerned with “unscrupulous collection agencies in operation that practice[d] abusive tactics”—”tactics which would shock the conscience of ordinary people”—such as “threatening delinquent debtors, or calling such people at outrageous times of the night” (Administrative Code § 20-488). Due to “the vulnerable position consumers [found] themselves in when dealing with these agencies” (id.), the Council resolved to institute a licensing requirement, among others, to protect consumers against “those agencies who would abuse their privilege of operation” (id.).  At the time the subject provision was first enacted, it contained only the definition of “debt collection agency” pertaining to the collection of debts owed to another (see id. § 20-489[a] [former § B32-97.1(c)]; Eric M. Berman, P.C. v City of New York, 25 NY3d 684, 688). However, as explained by the Court of Appeals, the “debt collection industry . . . continued to grow,” with consumer debt “being purchased at a steep discount by third parties” (Eric M. Berman, P.C. v City of New York, 25 NY3d at 688). These circumstances prompted the City Council to enact an amendment in 2009, expanding the definition of “`debt collection agency’ to `include a buyer of delinquent debt who seeks to collect such debt'” (id., quoting Administrative Code § 20-489[a]). The Council’s immediate concern, as reflected in the legislative history pertaining to that amendment, was the proliferation of credit card debt and the sale of such debt to debt buyers (Rep of Comm on Consumer Affairs, Consumer Debt Buyers [hereinafter Committee Report], 2009 NY City Legis Ann at 71-72). The Committee Report explained that while debt collection practices historically included outreach to the debtor, the new tactic being utilized by debt buyers was to proceed directly to New York City Civil Court, where most actions resulted in default judgments, many of which were not supported by valid evidence (see id. at 72; Eric M. Berman, P.C. v City of New York, 25 NY3d at 688). Debt buyers, who accounted for 90% of such consumer credit collection actions filed in Civil Court, had taken the position that they were “immune to licensing requirements” because they “outsource[d] the actual collection duties to other parties, such as debt collection law firms” (Committee Report at 72). The expanded definition of “debt collection agency” was intended to clarify that such debt buyers came under the umbrella of the Administrative Code’s protections for consumers.  The Administrative Code seeks to protect consumers from abusive tactics by instituting, in addition to the licensing requirement, certain required collection practices, including, requiring communications with consumers to provide “a call-back number to a phone that is answered by a natural person” (Administrative Code § 20-493.1[a][i]), “the name of the person to call back” (id. § 20-493.1[a][iv]), and “the amount of the debt” (id. § 20-493.1[a][v]). A debt collection agency is further required, upon the consumer’s request for verification of the debt, to furnish written documentation identifying the original creditor, and itemizing the principal balance of the debt and other charges allegedly due (see id. § 20-493.2[a]). A debt collection agency may not attempt to collect or contact a consumer until such verification is provided (see id.).  A judicial foreclosure action such as the one at bar does not constitute the sort of tactics “shocking to the conscience of ordinary people”—like phone calls at unreasonable hours and other threatening behavior—that the subject Administrative Code provisions were enacted to address. Furthermore, the particular requirements and prohibitions placed upon debt collectors under the Administrative Code are concerned with ensuring that consumers can verify that payment on a debt is actually due, learn the correct amount of the debt, and meaningfully communicate with the debt collection agency about the debt (see id. §§ 20-493.1, 20-493.2). In the context of judicial foreclosure, the state statutory scheme operates to protect homeowners and ensure fairness in the process, in a far more comprehensive manner and in ways that might not be entirely consistent with the Administrative Code provisions.  For example, RPAPL 1304 requires that at least 90 days before a foreclosure action is commenced, a notice be sent to the borrower or borrowers, the content of which is specified in the statute. Among other things, the statute dictates what contact information should be included. Specifically, it requires that the notice include contact information for at least five government approved housing counseling agencies, as well as for the Office of the Attorney General’s Homeowner Protection Program and the New York State Department of Financial Services’ helpline (see id. § 1304[1], [2]). Thus, RPAPL 1304 mandates the provision of contact information for independent entities that can assist mortgagors in dealing with the parties to which they are allegedly indebted. RPAPL 1304 also requires the notice to set forth certain facts about the default, including the amount due (see id.). The detailed notice mandated by this statute renders much of the verification requirement of Administrative Code § 20-493.2(a) superfluous.  The foreclosing plaintiff is also required to include a notice with the summons and complaint, containing further advisements to the borrower about foreclosure and its consequences, including ways that the borrower can protect himself or herself (see RPAPL 1303). While the Administrative Code focuses on facilitating a debtor’s communication with the debt collection agency, the RPAPL 1303(3) notice advises defendants to “immediately contact an attorney or [a] local legal aid office.”  Moreover, while the City Council was concerned with Civil Court actions founded on invalid proof, in “any residential foreclosure action involving a home loan” (CPLR 3012-b[a]), the complaint must include a certification by the plaintiff’s attorney that “the attorney has reviewed the facts of the case and that, based on consultation with representatives of the plaintiff identified in the certificate and the attorney’s review of pertinent documents, . . . there is a reasonable basis for the commencement of such action and that the plaintiff is currently the creditor entitled to enforce rights under such documents” (id.).  Further protecting the rights of mortgagors, in any “residential foreclosure action involving a home loan” (id. § 3408[a][1]), the court is required to hold a settlement conference to discuss “the relative rights and obligations of the parties” (id.) and to determine whether “the parties can reach a mutually agreeable resolution to help the defendant avoid losing his or her home,” including a loan modification or other loss mitigation options (id.).  In light of these and other specific state statutory requirements enacted to protect homeowners in residential foreclosure, we conclude that the City Council did not intend to include a plaintiff pursuing a judicial foreclosure action such as this one within the definition of “debt collection agency” set forth in the Administrative Code.  Moreover, this conclusion is supported by the interpretation of the United States Supreme Court of provisions of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (15 USC § 1692 et seq.; hereinafter FDCPA), which are similar to the subject Administrative Code provisions (see Obduskey v McCarthy & Holthus LLP, ___ US ___, 139 S Ct 1029; see also Eric M. Berman, P.C. v City of New York, 25 NY3d at 691 [looking to federal case law under the FDCPA for guidance in interpreting the subject provisions of the Administrative Code]). In Obduskey, the Supreme Court determined that the general definition of “debt collector” provided in the FDCPA did not include “those whose `principal purpose . . . is the enforcement of security interests'” (Obduskey v McCarthy & Holthus LLP, ___ US at ___, 139 S Ct at 1033, quoting 18 USC § 1692a[6]), at least where the business was engaged in nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings[1]. The FDCPA includes a provision prohibiting a “debt collector” from “[t]aking or threatening to take any nonjudicial action to effect dispossession or disablement of property” under certain enumerated circumstances (15 USC § 1692f[6]). The definition of “debt collector” contained in the FDCPA provides: “For the purpose of section 1692f(6) of this title, such term also includes any person who uses any instrumentality of interstate commerce or the mails in any business the principal purpose of which is the enforcement of security interests” (id. § 1692a[6]).  The United States Supreme Court reasoned in Obduskey that, if the general definition of “debt collector” was intended to include entities enforcing security interests, this quoted language in the definition of “debt collector” would not have been necessary (see Obduskey v McCarthy & Holthus LLP, ___ US at ___, 139 S Ct at 1037). The fact that the general definition of “debt collector” in the FDCPA was interpreted to exclude parties enforcing security interests provides guidance on the proper interpretation of the definition of “debt collection agency” set forth in the Administrative Code, even though the Code does not contain a provision similar to 15 USC § 1692f(6), such that explicit reference to enforcement of security interests in the Code was not necessary (see generally Eric M. Berman, P.C. v City of New York, 25 NY3d at 691). Indeed, the United States Supreme Court posited that “Congress may well have chosen to treat security-interest enforcement differently from ordinary debt collection in order to avoid conflicts with state nonjudicial foreclosure schemes” (Obduskey v McCarthy & Holthus LLP, ___ US at ___, 139 S Ct at 1037). Here, as we have explained, the state statutory scheme enacted to protect homeowners in foreclosure is far more comprehensive, and at the least, renders partially redundant, the provisions of the Administrative Code pertaining to debt collection agencies.  For all of the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the plaintiff in the instant action was not required to be licensed as a “debt collection agency” with respect to its prosecution of this foreclosure action. Thus, the complaint was not subject to dismissal under CPLR 3211(a)(7) for the failure of the plaintiff to plead that it had obtained such a license (see CPLR 3015[e]).  …..”"
Freedom of Information Act,"CDC tightened masking guidelines after threats from teachers union, emails show",Free Republic | Government News,Free Republic,"CDC tightened masking guidelines after threats from teachers union, emails show  Fox News ^ | Fox News | By Joe Schoffstall  Posted on 09/08/2021 10:41:32 AM PDT by Hojczyk  The Biden administration tightened its masking guidance after a prominent teachers union threatened White House officials with publicly releasing harsh criticism, internal emails show.  The National Education Association sent a draft statement to White House officials that included harsh criticism of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's masking guidance, the emails show. But the teachers union ultimately published a version with a much softer tone, and the CDC clarified its guidance to indicate that everyone should be masked in schools, regardless of vaccination status.  The new emails show further coordination between the White House and teachers unions just months after reports highlighted the extent the unions had influenced the administration's messaging on school reopenings. The watchdog group Americans for Public Trust obtained the emails through a Freedom of Information Act request and provided them to Fox News.  The CDC announced on May 13 that fully vaccinated Americans could stop wearing masks indoors and outside, which sparked confusion about how this policy would apply to schools.  ""This batch of emails came just weeks after we already exposed the teachers unions influenced the CDC on school openings,"" Americans for Public Trust Executive Director Caitlin Sutherland told Fox News. ""Lo and behold, less than two weeks later, they're at it again, but this time in relation to mask guidance.""  The New York Post reported on emails the watchdog group obtained earlier this year showing coordination between the Biden White House and influential teachers unions on school reopenings.  In at least two instances, suggestions offered by the American Federation of Teachers were ""adopted nearly verbatim"" in the final text of a CDC document on reopening guidance released in February, according to the Post.

Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II,Millicom Announces Bond Exchange Offer,Stockhouse | US Press Releases,Stockhouse,"Millicom Announces Bond Exchange Offer  Millicom Announces Bond Exchange OfferLuxembourg, September 8, 2021 @ Millicom International Cellular S.A. (the @Company&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;) (NASDAQ U.S.: TIGO, Nasdaq Stockholm: TIGO_SDB) announced today that it has offered to exchange up to ...  (1) As of September 7, 2021, holders of Old Notes held $500,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of Old Notes, prior to the application of the Pool Factor. In February 2021, the Company redeemed 10%, or $50 million, of the then-outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Old Notes, which amount was recorded by Euroclear, Clearstream and DTC as a prepayment of principal. In accordance with the procedures of Euroclear, Clearstream and DTC, book-entry positions of the Old Notes reflect the aggregate original issued principal amount and a pool factor of 90% (the “Pool Factor&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;).  (2) The outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Old Notes is stated after giving effect to the application of the Pool Factor.  (3) Our obligation to accept Old Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn is subject to a maximum aggregate original principal amount of Old Notes being sought in the Exchange Offer equal to the Maximum Acceptance Amount. If the aggregate original principal amount of all of the validly tendered and not validly withdrawn Old Notes exceeds the Maximum Acceptance Amount, then the Exchange Offer will be oversubscribed, and tenders of Old Notes will be subject to the proration and priority provisions described in the Offering Memorandum. We reserve the right to increase the Maximum Acceptance Amount at our discretion.  (4) Eligible holders will also receive accrued and unpaid interest on their Old Notes accepted for exchange from the last interest payment date up to but excluding the Early Exchange Date or the Final Exchange Date, as applicable (which dates are expected to be September 24, 2021 and October 8, 2021, respectively), less the accrued and unpaid interest on the New Notes from April 27, 2021 to the applicable Exchange Date.  (5) The Total Exchange Price for each $1,000 original principal amount of Old Notes (without giving effect to the Pool Factor) tendered and not validly withdrawn prior to the Early Participation Date.  (6) The Exchange Price for each $1,000 original principal amount of Old Notes (without giving effect to the Pool Factor) tendered and not validly withdrawn after the Early Participation Date and prior to the Expiration Date will be the Total Exchange Price less the Early Participation Payment.  (7) The Total Exchange Ratio is equal to the Total Exchange Price, divided by $1,035 (the “Price of New Notes&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;). Such amount, multiplied by $1,000, and further multiplied by the Pool Factor, represents the principal amount of New Notes a holder will be eligible to receive for each $1,000 original principal amount of Old Notes validly tendered and accepted prior to the Early Participation Date.  (8) The amount of New Notes to be issued to any holder will be issued in minimum denominations of $200,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 above such amount will be rounded down to the nearest U.S. $1,000. No tender of Old Notes will be accepted if it would result in the issuance of less than $200,000 principal amount of New Notes. Cash will be paid in lieu of any fractional entitlement of less than $1,000.00 in principal amount of New Notes that are not issued due to rounding.  (9) The Exchange Ratio is equal to the Exchange Price divided by the Price of New Notes. Such amount, multiplied by $1,000, and further multiplied by the Pool Factor, represents the principal amount of New Notes a holder will be eligible to receive for each $1,000 original principal amount of Old Notes validly tendered and accepted after the Early Participation Date.  The Exchange Price is an amount equal to the Total Exchange Price less the Early Participation Payment. The “Early Participation Payment&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; is equal to $31.05 and is payable in New Notes. Cash will be paid in lieu of any fractional entitlement of less than $1,000.00 in principal amount of New Notes that are not issued due to rounding (based on the application of the Total Exchange Ratio or Exchange Ratio, as applicable). The amount of cash paid in lieu will be equal to the principal amount of any fractional entitlement of New Notes multiplied by the Price of New Notes expressed as a percentage (103.5%).  Eligible Holders of 2026 Existing Notes properly tendered in the Exchange Offer (and not validly withdrawn) will be entitled to receive a cash payment equal to the accrued and unpaid interest on their 2026 Existing Notes accepted for exchange from the last applicable interest payment date up to but excluding the applicable settlement date, less the accrued and unpaid interest on the New Notes from April 27, 2021 (the last date on which interest on the existing 4.500% Senior Notes due 2031 has been paid) to the applicable Exchange Date (as defined below).  Exchange Dates  We reserve the right, but are under no obligation, at any point following the Early Participation Date and before the Expiration Date to accept for exchange any 2026 Existing Notes validly tendered at or prior to the Early Participation Date (the date of such exchange, the “Early Exchange Date&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;). The Early Exchange Date will be determined at our option and, if it occurs, is expected to occur promptly following the Early Participation Date. If, after the Early Participation Date, we choose to exercise our option to have an Early Exchange Date and all conditions to the Exchange Offer have been or are concurrently satisfied or waived by us, we will, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offering Memorandum, including the proration terms described in the Offering Memorandum, accept for exchange 2026 Existing Notes validly tendered in the Exchange Offer prior to the Early Participation Date up to the Maximum Acceptance Amount, and the exchange for such 2026 Existing Notes will be made on the Early Exchange Date. Regardless of whether we choose to exercise our option to have an Early Exchange Date, if, at or prior to the Expiration Date, all conditions to the Exchange Offer have been or concurrently are satisfied or waived by us, we will, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offering Memorandum, including the proration terms described in the Offering Memorandum, accept for exchange 2026 Existing Notes validly tendered in the Exchange Offer at or prior to the Expiration Date and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Withdrawal Date (the date of such exchange, the “Final Exchange Date&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;) up to (i) the Maximum Acceptance Amount less (ii) the 2026 Existing Notes exchanged on Early Exchange Date. The Final Exchange Date will be promptly after the Expiration Date. Each of the Early Exchange Date and the Final Exchange Date is referred to as an “Exchange Date.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;  Proration  Our obligation to accept 2026 Existing Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn is capped to the Maximum Acceptance Amount. If the aggregate principal amount of all of the validly tendered and not validly withdrawn 2026 Existing Notes exceeds the Maximum Acceptance Amount, then the Exchange Offer will be oversubscribed, and tenders of 2026 Existing Notes will be subject to the proration and priority provisions described in the Offering Memorandum.

Fair Housing Act,Christian college sues over Biden Fair Housing Act directive,Inside Higher Ed | News,Inside Higher Ed,"Christian college sues over Biden Fair Housing Act directive  College of the Ozarks argues that the Biden administration’s interpretation of the federal fair housing law forces the college to “open female showers, restrooms, and dorm rooms to biological males who assert a female gender identity.”  Ketchmark also wrote that any potential liability the college would face for violating the Fair Housing Act “would flow directly from the act itself” and from any relevant case law, not from the HUD memorandum.  The college appealed the ruling to the Eighth Circuit, which agreed to expedite arguments in the case and schedule a hearing date in November. Fourteen Republican state attorneys general submitted a friend of the court brief last month supporting the college’s case. Three Baptist universities in Missouri also filed an amicus brief arguing that private colleges “face an existential threat” under the HUD directive.  The College of the Ozarks argues that the directive is unlawful “for at least five reasons.” Among its arguments, the colleges says the directive violates the First Amendment and was promulgated in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. It also argues the Fair Housing Act does not encompass discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.  The college said in a brief submitted to the appellate court that according to its “religiously informed code of conduct … sex is determined at birth and based on biology, not gender identity, and students agree not to engage in sex outside marriage between a man and a woman. This code governs the College’s single-sex residence halls, including communal showers, restrooms, dorm rooms, and roommate selection, as well as its pronoun usage and visitation policies.”  The College of the Ozarks argued in the brief that it “would suffer immeasurable harm to its religious exercise, its free speech, and its students’ privacy interests. Abandoning its code of conduct and opening female private spaces to biological men jeopardizes the College’s ability to function, harms students, and dissuades them from attending the College.”  “Conversely, if the College disregards the government’s rewritten FHA, the Directive threatens ‘full enforcement,’” the brief states. This includes “investigations, enforcement actions, and litigation that could impose costly discovery and legal fees, millions in penalties and punitive damages, and criminal penalties against the College and its employees,” the College of the Ozarks said in its brief. “The College’s liability under the Directive grows exponentially each day as the College continues to speak about and apply its housing policies.”  “The thing to remember is College of the Ozarks is a religious school that tries to provide a religious education,” said Julie Marie Blake, senior counsel for regulatory litigation for Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative legal organization that is representing the college. “It is a school that does not charge tuition, instead welcoming students who agree to follow its code of conduct. It’s targeted at students with some of the most financial need, and the government should not be threatening the College of the Ozarks with ruinous fines that could be in the six figures or even unlimited that could require it to close its doors or close the doors to student housing just because it has a religious code of conduct that governs its housing.”  HUD’s media office did not respond to several requests for comment.  In court documents, the Biden administration says the memorandum was intended to bring HUD’s policies in line with the Supreme Court’s reasoning in the Bostock v. Clayton County ruling. The June 2020 ruling held that the prohibition on sex discrimination in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.  A legal analysis by HUD concluded that the Supreme Court’s reasoning equally applies to the Fair Housing Act, as the relevant section of Title VII prohibiting sex-based discrimination is ""nearly identical"" to that of the Fair Housing Act.  In a recent brief, the government argued that the district court's decision to dismiss the suit for lack of standing was correct and noted that the memorandum at issue does not address how the FHA interacts with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which prohibits sex-based discrimination but includes an exemption for religious institutions, or other statutory or constitutional protections of religious liberties.  ""For many of the same reasons that plaintiff lacks standing, its claims also are not ripe,"" the government said in its brief. ""Because the Memorandum has not caused plaintiff any actual or imminent injury, there is no sufficiently ripe case or controversy … As the district court recognized, facts and context matter in analyzing whether plaintiff’s housing policies might violate the FHA, and in determining how the FHA would interact with Title IX (under which plaintiff has a religious exemption for its housing policies), and with other statutory or constitutional protections of religious rights.""  The government also said, “There is no history of HUD seeking to enforce the FHA’s prohibition of sex discrimination against an educational institution subject to Title IX’s religious exemption, and certainly not any institution like plaintiff, which the Department of Education has recognized is entitled to such an exemption.”  The Council for Christian Colleges and Universities, which is not a party to the lawsuit, declined to comment.  Paul Southwick, a lawyer and director of the Religious Exemption Accountability Project, is representing a group of LGBTQ+ current and former students from more than 30 Christian colleges, including the College of the Ozarks, in a separate lawsuit against the Department of Education challenging Title IX’s exemption for religious colleges. Southwick said he disagreed with the government’s position that the case is not ripe for adjudication and added that one of the plaintiffs in that lawsuit, a former student at College of the Ozarks, filed a Title IX complaint with the Education Department about the college’s policies and practices regarding LGBTQ+ students, including its housing policies.  “Beyond that, we know there are transgender students right now who need the housing protection that the government has promised to provide through the Fair Housing Act,” Southwick said. “So it is ripe, and it is timely.”"

Sarbanes Oxley Act,Second U.S. judge questions constitutionality of lead felony charge against Oath Keepers in Capitol riot,The Washington Post | Politics,The Washington Post,"Second U.S. judge questions constitutionality of lead felony charge against Oath Keepers in Capitol riot  Courts ask whether the obstruction of Congress charge employed by the Justice Department is unconstitutionally vague. Defendants in at least eight cases have asked that the count be dismissed.  A second federal judge in Washington questioned whether the lead felony charge leveled by the government against Capitol riot defendants is unconstitutionally vague, as 18 Oath Keepers accused in a conspiracy case urged the court on Wednesday to toss out a count carrying one of the heaviest penalties against them.  U.S. District Judge Amit P. Mehta asked how federal prosecutors distinguish felony conduct qualifying as “obstructing an official proceeding” of Congress — punishable by up to 20 years in prison — from misdemeanor offenses the government has charged others with, such as shouting to interrupt a congressional hearing.  “Essentially, what you said is, ‘Trust us’. … And that is a real problem when it comes to criminal statutes, to suggest, ‘We know it when we see it, and we’ll pick and choose when it is an appropriate exercise of prosecutorial discretion,” Mehta said.  Prosecutors have brought the obstruction charge in many of the most notorious cases, including against members of the Oath Keepers, Proud Boys and Three Percenters groups who allegedly conspired and prepared in advance for violence. The government has also leveled the charge against scores of individuals not accused of attacking police or destroying property but with some of the most egregious allegations — such as occupying the Senate chamber, sitting in the vice president’s chair and targeting government officials.  Prosecutors have sought to distinguish such acts from protest-related civil disobedience that rarely results in prison time or more politically charged offenses such as sedition.  However, defendants in at least eight cases have moved to dismiss the count. They assert that the joint House and Senate session that met Jan. 6 does not qualify as an official proceeding of Congress; that the law is unconstitutionally vague on its face or as applied; or that it does not cover individual’s alleged illegal actions, among other things.  The challenges rejoin a long-standing debate over what Congress meant when it overhauled an obstruction-of-justice statute in 2002, when as part of the ­Sarbanes-Oxley corporate responsibility act it broadly expanded a provision to cover “whoever corruptly … obstructs, in­fluences, or impedes any official proceeding.”  The Justice Department has argued that Congress intended a broad “catchall” provision for obstructive acts, passing Sarbanes-Oxley after a corporate fraud crisis wiped out hundreds of billions of dollars of shareholder value, including the early 2000s collapse of Enron Corp. and accounting giant Arthur Andersen.  Congress’s whole point in enacting such general clauses is to cover “matters not specifically contemplated” because lawmakers do “not know what inventive criminal minds” might come up with in the future, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeffrey S. Nestler said during the hearing Wednesday.  But some legal scholars question whether the expansion applies only to financial fraud or to traditional ­obstruction-of-justice crimes such as destroying documents.  As fellow U.S. District Judge Randolph D. Moss did last month, Mehta noted that the Supreme Court in 2015 rejected an expansive reading of a related law, tossing the conviction of a Florida fisherman who destroyed smaller-than-20-inch red grouper to impede U.S. wildlife inspectors. The court ruled that when Congress barred the destruction of any “tangible object,” it meant documentary evidence, not fish.  “It seems to me — and I say this after having thought about this a fair amount — this statute potentially suffers from the same problems,” Mehta said.  Mehta, who was appointed to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in 2014, said he could easily follow the high court’s plurality opinion and toss out the charge. Like Moss, Mehta said the government must be able to put individuals clearly on notice how “corruptly” obstructing or influencing Congress differs from ordinary trespassing, parading or disorderly conduct in the Capitol — lesser charges that are punishable by no more than six months in prison.  “The million-dollar question is, what’s the limiting principle?” Mehta said, suggesting the statute “clearly brings in innocent conduct,” encompassing anyone seeking to influence Congress.  Nestler cited two — that the statute targets only those who act “corruptly,” which he argued is an established question for juries to decide, and actions with a “nexus” or tie to a defined proceeding.  Nestler agreed that it is not a crime punishable by up to 20 years to stand and shout at a congressional confirmation hearing, “Stop this proceeding!” — but argued it is if one adds, “There’s a bomb under your chairs!”  “The objective here was not just to halt proceedings. The objective here was to scare Congress into halting proceedings,” Nestler said, likening the act to obstructing justice by raiding a courthouse or courtroom and forcing judges and jurors to flee a trial.  Still, Mehta protested, “Scaring the daylights out of everyone in the House or Senate … to me is very different than destroying evidence or intimidating witness.”  “That’s what the government intends to prove at trial,” Nestler replied, that these defendants acted corruptly “because they intended to intimidate Congress.”  Defense attorney David Fischer, arguing for Navy veteran Thomas Caldwell, of Berryville, Va., objected that interrupting an electoral vote certification was different from obstructing justice.  “It would be like someone interrupting a congressional declaration of war. That’s a very serious event, but it’s not obstruction of justice,” Fischer said.  Attorney Carmen D. Hernandez, defending Ohio militia member Donovan Crowl, argued if the government’s “catchall” interpretation of the law were correct, “That’s the only statute you would need for obstruction.”  Moss and Mehta are the only judges who have heard argument on the question, promising to rule quickly after receiving additional briefing over the next month. Near the end of Wednesday’s two-hour argument, Mehta concluded, “I don’t want this to sit very long.”  At the outset of Wednesday’s hearing, defense attorney Bradford Geyer of New Jersey said he had been retained by the family of one of the co-defendants, Army veteran Kenneth Harrelson, of Brevard County, Fla., to replace John M. Pierce, an attorney who represents 17 riot defendants but who had not been appearing in court. His associates at one point said he had contracted the novel coronavirus.  Pierce reemerged an hour before the Oath Keepers hearing in another case, however, filing a notice in Harrelson’s case explaining he had been incommunicado since Aug. 23 because he has spent 12 days in the hospital before being released Sunday. Pierce did not elaborate on why he was hospitalized, and said he expects to be “fully operational next week.”  “I was not ‘missing’ or anything of the sort,” Pierce wrote.  Geyer said he did not know and has not spoken with Pierce nor anyone he worked with, but that the Harrelson’s told him to go forward as best he could."

Place of Meetings.  Meetings of stockholders may be held at any place,  within or without the State of Delaware, as may be designated by the Board of Directors (the “Board  of Directors”) of The Container Store Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Corporation”).  The  Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion, determine that a meeting of stockholders shall not be  held at any place, but may instead be held solely by means of remote communication authorized by  and in accordance with Section 211(a)(2) of the General Corporation of the State of Delaware (the  “General Corporation Law”).  In the absence of any such designation, meetings of stockholders shall  be held at the principal executive office of the Corporation.  Section 1.2.  Annual Meetings.  If required by applicable law, an annual meeting of  stockholders  shall  be  held  for  the  election  of  directors  at  such  date,  time  and  place,  if  any,  either  within or without the State of Delaware, as may be designated by resolution of the Board of Directors  from  time  to  time.    Any  other  proper  business  may  be  transacted  at  the  annual  meeting.    The  Corporation  may  postpone,  reschedule  or  cancel  any  annual  meeting  of  stockholders  previously  scheduled by the Board of Directors.  Section 1.3.  Special Meetings.  Special meetings of stockholders for any purpose or  purposes  may  be  called  only  in  the  manner  provided  in  the  certificate  of  incorporation  of  the  Corporation  (the  “Certificate  of  Incorporation”).    Business  transacted  at  any  special  meeting  of  stockholders shall be limited to the purposes stated in the notice of such meeting.  The Corporation  may postpone, reschedule or cancel any special meeting of stockholders previously scheduled by the  Board of Directors.  Section 1.4.  Notice of Meetings.    (a) Whenever  stockholders  are  required  or  permitted  to  take  any  action  at  a  meeting, a notice of the meeting shall be given that shall state the place, if any, date and hour of the  meeting, the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may  be  deemed  to  be  present  in  person  and  vote  at  such  meeting,  the  record  date  for  determining  the  stockholders  entitled  to  vote  at  the  meeting  (if  such  date  is  different  from  the  record  date  for  stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting) and, in the case of a special  -2-  meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called.  Unless otherwise provided by law,  the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws (these “Bylaws”), the notice of any meeting shall be  given  not  less  than  ten  (10)  nor  more  than  sixty  (60)  days  before  the  date  of  the  meeting  to  each  stockholder  entitled  to  vote  at  the  meeting  as  of  the  record  date  for  determining  the  stockholders  entitled to notice of the meeting.    (b) Notice of any meeting of stockholders shall be deemed given:  (i) if  mailed,  when  deposited  in  the  United  States  mail,  postage  prepaid,  directed to the stockholder at such stockholder’s address as it appears on the Corporation’s records;  (ii) if delivered by courier service, the earlier of when the notice is received  or left at the stockholder’s address as it appears on the Corporation’s records; or  (iii) if electronically transmitted, as provided in Section 8.1 of these bylaws.  An  affidavit  of  the  Secretary  or  an  Assistant  Secretary  of  the  Corporation  or  of  the  transfer agent or any other agent of the Corporation that the notice has been given by mail or by a  form of electronic transmission, as applicable, shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence  of the facts stated therein.  Except as otherwise prohibited under the General Corporation Law, without limiting  the  manner  by  which  notice  otherwise  may  be  given  effectively  to  stockholders,  any  notice  to  stockholders  given  by  the  Corporation  under  the  provisions  of  the  General  Corporation  Law,  the  Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws shall be effective if given by a single written notice to  stockholders who share an address if consented to by the stockholders at that address to whom such  notice  is  given.  Any  such  consent  shall  be  revocable  by  the  stockholder  by  written  notice  to  the  Corporation.  Any  stockholder  who  fails  to  object  in  writing  to  the  Corporation,  within  60  days  of  having been given written notice by the Corporation of its intention to send the single notice, shall be  deemed to have consented to receiving such single written notice.  Section  1.5.    Adjournments.    Any  meeting  of  stockholders,  annual  or  special,  may  adjourn from time to time to reconvene at the same or some other place, if any, and notice need not  be  given  of  any  such  adjourned  meeting  if  the  time  and  place,  if  any,  thereof,  and  the  means  of  remote  communications,  if  any,  by  which  stockholders  and  proxy  holders  may  be  deemed  to  be  present  in  person  and  vote  at  such  adjourned  meeting  are  announced  at  the  meeting  at  which  the  adjournment is taken.  At the adjourned meeting the Corporation may transact any business which  might have been transacted at the original meeting.  If the adjournment is for more than thirty (30)  days, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at  the meeting.  If after the adjournment a new record date for determination of stockholders entitled to  vote  is  fixed  for  the  adjourned  meeting,  the  Board  of  Directors  shall  fix  as  the  record  date  for  determining stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as  that fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the  -3-  adjourned meeting, and shall give notice of the adjourned meeting to each stockholder of record as of  the record date so fixed for notice of such adjourned meeting.  Section  1.6.    Quorum.    Except  as  otherwise  provided  by  law,  the  Certificate  of  Incorporation or these Bylaws, at each meeting of stockholders the presence in person, or by remote  communication, if applicable, or represented by proxy, of the holders of a majority in voting power of  the  outstanding  shares  of  stock  entitled  to  vote  at  the  meeting  shall  be  necessary  and  sufficient  to  constitute  a  quorum  for  the  transaction  of  business  at  all  meetings  of  the  stockholders.    Where  a  separate vote by class or series is required on a matter, the holders of a majority in voting power of  such  class  or  series  issued  and  outstanding  and  entitled  to  vote,  present  in  person,  or  by  remote  communication, if applicable, or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for such matter.  A  quorum,  once  established  at  a  meeting,  shall  not  be  broken  by  the  withdrawal  of  enough  votes  to  leave less than a quorum.  If, however, a quorum is not present or represented at any meeting of the  stockholders, then either (a) the person presiding over the meeting or (b) a majority in voting power  of the stockholders, present in person, or by remote communication, if applicable, or represented by  proxy, and entitled to vote thereon shall have the power to adjourn the meeting from time to time in  the manner provided in Section 1.5 of these Bylaws until a quorum is present or represented.  Shares  of its own stock belonging to the Corporation or to another corporation, if a majority of the shares  entitled to vote in the election of directors of such other corporation is held, directly or indirectly, by  the  Corporation,  shall  neither  be  entitled  to  vote  nor  be  counted  for  quorum  purposes;  provided,  however,  that  the  foregoing  shall  not  limit  the  right  of  the  Corporation  or  any  subsidiary  of  the  Corporation  to  vote  stock,  including  but  not  limited  to  its  own  stock,  held  by  it  in  a  fiduciary  capacity.  Section  1.7.    Organization.    Meetings  of  stockholders  shall  be  presided  over  by  a  chairperson designated by the Board of Directors.  In the absence of such a designation, meetings of  stockholders shall be presided over by the Chairperson of the Board, if any, or in his or her absence  by the Vice Chairperson of the Board, if any, or in his or her absence by the Chief Executive Officer,  or in the absence of the foregoing persons by the President, or in the absence of the foregoing persons  by  a  Vice  President,  or  in  the  absence  of  the  foregoi"

""Ich bin sehr entschieden dafür gewesen, dass wir die Erleichterungen zustande bringen, die wir jetzt im Rahmen der Corona-Krise möglich gemacht haben"", sagte Scholz beim Handelsblatt-Bankengipfel mit Blick auf die Regulierungsvorschriften von Basel IV. Die Bestimmungen seien aber ""ein wichtiger Beitrag zur Stabilität des Finanzsystems"", betonte der Bundesfinanzminister. ""Deshalb kann es keinen Rollback in dieser Frage geben.""  Scholz betonte, es dürfe nicht wieder zu einer Krise wie nach dem Zusammenbruch der US-Investmentbank Lehman Brothers kommen. Es gehe darum, ""dass wir jetzt nicht auf die Idee verfallen, dass Wachstum nur möglich ist, wenn möglichst wenige Regeln existieren"", sagte der Finanzminister. Er wolle den Weg weiter gehen, sich im Einzelfall konkrete Regelungen anzusehen. ""Es bleibt dabei, dass ich mich sehr wohl dazu bekenne, dass wir auch eine klare Regulierung brauchen"", betonte der SPD-Kanzlerkandidat aber.  Nötig seien wettbewerbsfähige Banken, und das Wichtigste sei, dass sie ""ihre Hausaufgaben machen"", etwa zur Digitalisierung und der Entwicklung eines wirtschaftlich erfolgreichen Modells. Voraussetzung für die Wettbewerbsfähigkeit sei, ""Europa als Ganzes"" in den Blick zu nehmen. Scholz warb für weitere Verhandlungen zur europäischen Bankenunion, trotz vieler Vorbehalte in einzelnen Ländern. ""Das ist auch eine Führungsaufgabe, und da werden am Ende auch die Staats- und Regierungschefs gefragt sein"", betonte der SPD-Kanzlerkandidat. Als Kanzler würde er ""mit den Kolleginnen und Kollegen in Europa darüber diskutieren, dass sie das auch gleichermassen politisch wichtig finden und das nicht immer vertagt wird"", kündigte Scholz an.

Bostic, der die meiste Zeit dieses Jahres dafür plädiert hat, dass die Fed ihre monatlichen Anleihekäufe in Höhe von 120 Milliarden Dollar einschränkt, sagte in einem Interview mit dem Wall Street Journal, dass die jüngsten Daten und das Wiederaufflammen der Pandemie mehr Zeit erfordern, bevor eine Entscheidung über die Reduzierung der Konjunkturhilfen getroffen wird.

""Wir müssen das sehr genau beobachten, wie sich die Inflation weiter entwickelt"", sagte Scholz beim Handelsblatt-Bankengipfel.

Truth in Lending Compliance,Fed extends TILA disclosure requirements,Buckley Sandler | Resource Center Search,BuckleySandler,"Fed extends TILA disclosure requirements  Agency Rule-Making & Guidance Federal Reserve TILA Regulation Z Disclosures  On September 1, the Federal Reserve Board adopted a proposal to extend the recordkeeping and disclosure requirements associated with the TILA, implemented by Regulation Z for three years, with revision. While Dodd-Frank transferred rule-writing authority for Fed-supervision institutions under Regulation Z to the CFPB, the Fed is taking action to “minimize burden on small entities through tailored supervision, including through a risk-focused consumer compliance supervision program and an examination frequency policy that provides for lengthened time between examinations for institutions with a lower risk profile.” As previously covered by InfoBytes, the Board proposed in April to revise FR Z (OMB No. 7100-0199) to: (i) include burden connected to disclosure requirements in “rules issued by the Bureau since the Board’s last Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) submission, as well as for one information collection for which the Bureau estimates burden” but the Board formerly did not; (ii) break out and clarify “burden estimates” that were formerly consolidated; and (iii) eliminate burden associated with some requirements due to the Bureau accounting for burden for the entire industry, or because the burden is now deemed a part of an institution’s usual and customary business practices. The revisions will be implemented as proposed and are effective immediately."
Truth in Lending Compliance,CFPB settles with ISA provider on unfair practices,Buckley Sandler | Resource Center Search,BuckleySandler,"CFPB settles with ISA provider on unfair practices  Federal Issues CFPB TILA Regulation Z CFPA Enforcement  On September 7, the CFPB announced a settlement with a Virginia-based non-profit income share agreement (ISA) provider, and its affiliated companies, to resolve allegations that the company engaged in deceptive acts with respect to its ISAs product to finance postsecondary education, in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act, among other things. The CFPB alleged that the company engaged in unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices by misrepresenting that its ISAs are not loans and do not create debt, failing to provide certain required disclosures, and imposing unlawful prepayment penalties on private education loans.  Under the terms of the consent order, the company is required to: (i) cease stating that its ISAs are not loans or do not create debt for consumers; (ii) provide the disclosures required by the Truth in Lending Act and its implementing Regulation Z for closed-end credit; (iii) “continue their practice of not objecting to any discharge of a student’s ISA in bankruptcy”; and (iv) reform its ISA contracts to remove prepayment penalties on private education loans and, for some ISAs, recalculate the payment caps to eliminate the prepayment penalty. The order does not impose a civil money penalty."
Privacy Regulations,FireMon Founder Jody Brazil Returns As CEO After Acquisition,Computer Reseller News | Security Headlines,Computer Reseller News,"FireMon Founder Jody Brazil Returns As CEO After Acquisition  ‘This is more than just acquiring the [DisruptOps] technology. This is about fundamentally shifting FireMon from the historic on-prem technology management platform that we’ve been into the age of the cloud,’ says Jody Brazil.  Longtime FireMon CEO Jody Brazil has returned as the company’s top executive following the firm’s acquisition of cloud security operations startup DisruptOps.  Brazil is replacing Satin Mirchandani, who had served as president and CEO of Overland Park, Kansas-based network security policy management vendor FireMon since 2016. Brazil co-founded FireMon, was its CEO from 2004 to 2015, and continued in other executive roles at the company until leaving at the start of 2018 to launch and lead DisruptOps. FireMon’s acquisition of DisruptOps closed Aug. 30.  “We have the same missions,” Brazil told CRN. “The underlying technologies we help manage are a little different, but it’s the exact same mission for the exact same people.”  [Related: Sources: Firemon Executive Exodus Sees CEO, CTO And CISO Departures]  The rest of FireMon’s existing leadership team outside of Mirchandani will remain with the company, with DisruptOps Chief Operating Officer Matt Eberhart taking over go-to-market for the combined company. FireMon Founder and Chairman Gary Fish brought up the idea of combining the two companies during a round of golf with Brazil in early July, and terms of the deal weren’t disclosed.  Both FireMon and DisruptOps are focused on security management, Brazil said, with the former specializing in putting firewalls on networks and managing them. DisruptOps, meanwhile, provides an operations platform to manage cloud technologies that can identify where mistakes were made, understand what the mistakes are and fix those problems, according to Brazil.  FireMon has an immediate opportunity to cross-sell the DisruptOps technology to its more than 1,000 marquee enterprise customers, Brazil said. The company plans to quickly educate its sales teams and sales engineers about DisruptOps and roll out channel enablement around DisruptOps in roughly a month. Both FireMon and DisruptOps are typically purchased by the CISO or director of security, he said.  The acquisition of DisruptOps will allow FireMon to expand its support of security policies in the public cloud beyond firewalls to include network load balancers and other technologies, Brazil said. FireMon had some demo and testing capabilities around network security policy management for Azure and AWS, but the DisruptOps deal will really help manage identities and access at the control plane level.  “This is more than just acquiring the technology,” Brazil said. “This is about fundamentally shifting FireMon from the historic on-prem technology management platform that we’ve been into the age of the cloud.”  DisruptOps helps enforce security policies and define what good looks like in the cloud and is vital to organizations who are looking to migrate from the data center to the cloud, according to Brazil. The company’s technology historically hadn’t been sold much through the channel but going forward will be delivered exclusively through solution providers just like FireMon as a whole, Brazil said.  Brazil expects to see solution providers offering cost management services around DisruptOps as well as including it as part of their managed security bundle. From a metrics perspective, Brazil is tracking in the near-term how many existing FireMon customers also sign up to be customers of DisruptOps. Over time, Brazil said the DisruptOps deal should help with incorporating cloud into FireMon’s long-term strategy.  “We sit in a very good spot to go deliver the security operations platform of the future,” Brazil said.  Bringing the security and DevOps teams together to find and fix issues before they are a problem is typically challenging, according to Mark Miller, Kudelski Security’s general manager for the Southern United States. Security in the public cloud is a huge concern for clients of Kudelski, and the DisruptOps technology could help alleviate those concerns, Miller told CRN in an email.  “This is an opportunity for us to align better with clients’ cloud projects and gives us something unique to sell,” Miller said. “This looks like it will help streamline the process of identifying security risks in public cloud environments, which can be very difficult.”"

The  SBA would  be an   important part of our governmental practice and our Firm.   Our audit will be performed in accordance   with U.S. generally accepted auditing standards, the standards applicable to financial audits contained   in    Government Auditing Standards  , issued by the Comptroller General of the United States;  and  if   applicable,    Part 200—Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements   For Federal Awards, commonly referred to as the “Uniform Guidance”.   Brown, Edwards & Company,   L.L.P. (“Brown Edwards”) has a large state and municipal governmental practice and is a leader in   providing services to those clients in West Virginia and throughout the region. As described in Appendix   A, we have committed an engagement team with extensive experience serving state of West Virginia   governmental entities. We have a track record of providing quality and timely service, reliable advice,   and clear communication. In addition to quality service, you need a firm that can be responsive to your   needs, serve you as a priority client, and provide a high degree of personalized service. We believe our   previous  experience with the SBA  as Gibbons & Kawash and other similar State of West Virginia   governmental entities allow us to present the highest qualifications and value for the services requested.   Our overall experience with state agencies is unmatched by other local or regional firms. Providing audit   services to state government entities is an important part of our practice and one in which we have   extensive expertise. We have a wealth of historical experience auditing 28 State of West Virginia   component units and funds over the last twenty-five years, which individually range in size up to $4   billion in assets and $2 billion in revenues.    Should we be appointed to serve as auditors of the SBA,  the  SBA  will receive the highest quality   professional audit services from auditors that will plan, conduct, and report on the audit with   competence, integrity, objectivity, and that are independent of the SBA and the State of West Virginia   in all respects. Our track record of providing quality and timely service, reliable advice, and clear   communication is well known. In addition to quality service, you need a firm that can be responsive to   your needs, serve you as a priority client, and provide a high degree of personalized service.   Our understanding of the SBA simply cannot be matched, and will ensure that your audit is conducted   with uncompromising quality. Our audit teams have included and will continue to include members with   a strong institutional knowledge of the SBA, with new members assigned to the audit team every year   or two to provide a “fresh look” and perspective to the SBA’s audit. Our team is equipped with much   more than a surface level understanding of GASB statements – they have a deep understanding of the   accounting principles and concepts which underlie those standards. This helps our team tackle unusual   or complex matters efficiently and effectively, and gives our clients confidence that we are addressing   such matters appropriately.     2   In addition, we have access to the resources of one of the nation’s largest accounting and advisory firms,   BDO USA, and hundreds of other CPA and specialty consulting firms, through our membership in the   BDO Alliance USA. Other firms would be hard pressed to demonstrate our depth and breadth of   experience.   The global pandemic known as COVID-19 has been challenging for everyone. At Brown Edwards our top   priority in any engagement is to protect the safety and security of your staff and ours. We pledge to   observe any and all protocols you have established during the conduct of our audit and know that we   have established internal protocols that comply with CDC and local health guidelines. Our technical and   remote capabilities allow for flexibility in responding to your needs during this pandemic.     We have structured this proposal to communicate our experience and qualifications to effectively and   efficiently respond to the requirements and expectations of the SBA, and have made every effort to   completely respond to all matters identified in your request for proposal. We would be pleased to meet   with you and formally present our proposal upon your request. If you have any questions, please do not   hesitate to contact me at (304) 343-4188.

Paycheck Protection Program,"As pandemic jobless benefits and eviction protections end, here's what federal help is still available",WYFF-TV Channel 4 | National News,WYFF-TV Channel 4,"As pandemic jobless benefits and eviction protections end, here's what federal help is still available  Americans are no longer protected from evictions or receiving beefed-up unemployment payments, but they are still benefiting from many other federal coronavirus rescue measures.More support may be on the way, as Democrats on Capitol Hill hammer out a 10-year, $3.5 trillion budget reconciliation bill that would greatly expand the nation's safety net programs.Yet passage of that legislation isn't guaranteed, and while the economy is in better shape than it was earlier in the pandemic, many families are still struggling to get back on their feet.These relief measures remain in effect.Enhanced child tax creditsTens of millions of American families will receive four more monthly child tax credit payments as part of Congress' enhancement to the program for 2021.The next installment — up to $300 for each child up to age 6 and $250 for each one age 6 through 17 — will be sent next week.Eligible families will receive a total of up to $3,600 for each child under 6 and up to $3,000 for each one age 6 to 17 for 2021. That's an increase from the regular child tax credit of up to $2,000 for each kid up to age 17.Parents will receive half their credit this year and can claim the other half when they file their 2021 taxes next year. The full enhanced credit is available for heads of households earning $112,500 and joint filers making up to $150,000 a year, after which it begins to phase out. For many families, the credit then plateaus at $2,000 per child and starts to phase out for single parents earning more than $200,000 or for married couples with incomes above $400,000.More low-income parents are eligible for the child tax credit this year because the Democrats' March relief package made it fully refundable. It had been only partially refundable — leaving more than 26 million children unable to get the full credit because their families' incomes were too low, according to Treasury Department estimates.The Internal Revenue Service sent more than $15 billion to the parents of roughly 61 million children in August. The first payments went out in July.The enhanced credit, which is expected to cut child poverty nearly in half this year, is only available for 2021, however. Lawmakers are hoping to extend the boost for several more years as part of the reconciliation bill.Rental assistanceAlthough the federal eviction moratorium expired in August, roughly 90% of the $46 billion in federal emergency rent relief money was still available as of last month.The funds, which started flowing in January, have been slow to reach those in need. Typically, renters must apply for the money — but the process varies by state, many of which had to build new administrative systems to distribute the money. Sometimes landlords need to submit applications first.Eligibility is based on a household's financial situation and housing needs. The money can be used to cover rent, utilities, late fees and moving expenses.Student loan deferralPayments on federal student loans have not been required since March 2020. Repayment is set to resume in February, after an unprecedented 23-month freeze.During this time, borrowers' balances have effectively been frozen because interest has also stopped adding up — saving the average borrower about $2,000 over the first year — and collections on defaulted debt have been on hold. The relief is even more significant for those who work in the public sector and may be eligible for loan forgiveness after 10 years. They are still receiving credit toward those 10 years of required payments as if they had continued to make them during the pandemic, as long as they are still working full time for qualifying employers.The freeze on payments has been extended several times by both the Trump and Biden administrations, but the Department of Education said that the latest extension — which pushed the repayment start date from October to February — would be the last.Additional nutrition assistanceFood stamp recipients will continue to receive a 15% increase in monthly benefits through the end of the month, as part of the Democrats' March relief bill.Starting in October, monthly food stamp benefits will jump 27% above pre-pandemic levels, on average — the largest increase in the program's history. Under the revision, which is permanent, beneficiaries will see a $36 hike in average monthly benefits.The boost stems from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's update to the Thrifty Food Plan, which determines the benefit amounts of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, the formal name for food stamps. The update is part of a USDA review of the food stamp program required under the 2018 Farm Bill. Most food stamp enrollees are also receiving an emergency allotment that lawmakers approved at the start of the outbreak last year, though a handful of states have dropped out of the program.States can also apply for the Pandemic-EBT program for the 2021-22 school year to replace meals lost by children because their schools and child care facilities are closed or have restricted their in-person schedules due to the coronavirus. Congress created the program in the spring of 2020 to help alleviate hunger among children.Beefed-up Affordable Care Act subsidiesLawmakers enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies for 2021 and 2022, seeking to address the main complaint about the law — that policies are not affordable, especially for the middle class.Enrollees now pay no more than 8.5% of their income toward coverage, down from nearly 10%. And lower-income policyholders can receive subsidies that eliminate their premiums completely, as can out-of-work Americans who received unemployment benefits this year, depending on the plan they pick.Also, those earning more than 400% of the federal poverty level — about $51,000 for an individual and $104,800 for a family of four in 2021 — are eligible for help for the first time.While the special enrollment period for the uninsured has closed, those who have lost work-based coverage or had major life changes, such as marriage or divorce, can sign up for policies. And the open enrollment period for 2022 coverage starts on Nov. 1.Money for schoolsTogether, the three major pandemic relief packages passed by Congress authorized more than $190 billion to help America's schools reopen and stay open during the pandemic. A lot of the funds were used to buy PPE, upgrade ventilation and boost summer school programs, but there are still billions of dollars left to be spent. It's up to local school boards to decide how to use a majority of the money, though 20% must be used to address learning loss. It's a huge federal investment, equal to roughly six times the amount of fiscal year 2021 base funding, and Congress gave schools more than three years to spend the latest and biggest round. It's unlikely to be spent all at once, especially if it's used for teachers' salaries or capital improvements that are paid for over time.These programs have endedPandemic unemployment benefits. Congress' historic expansion of the unemployment benefits system expired nationwide last weekend.Laid-off Americans are no longer receiving the $300 boost to their weekly benefits. Also finished are the two programs that provided payments to freelancers, independent contractors, the self-employed, certain people affected by the coronavirus and those who exhausted their state benefits.More than 8 million people are now left with no unemployment compensation at all, while another 2.7 million lost the $300 federal supplement but will continue receiving state payments, according to estimates by The Century Foundation.Two dozen states opted to terminate one or more of the programs in June and July, affecting 2.7 million jobless residents. The governors — all but one of them Republicans — wanted to push their residents to look for jobs.But experts warned that employment is not expected to suddenly surge.Eviction protections. A federal eviction moratorium expired in August after the Supreme Court blocked the latest attempt by the Biden administration to extend it.Eviction filings are expected to ramp up, but it is yet to be seen how backlogged courts are and how effective the remaining patchwork of state and local protections will be in keeping renters in place until they secure rent relief. Some state and local jurisdictions have been enacting their own eviction bans to protect renters while the process of distributing rental assistance continues.The federal moratorium — which frustrated landlords — was first put in place last September by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent the spread of the coronavirus and expired at the end of July.But pressure from housing advocates, who argued against ending the ban before the bulk of the federal rental assistance money was distributed, pushed the Biden administration to issue a new ban covering areas where COVID-19 infection rates are elevated, protecting about 90% of renters. That was blocked by the Supreme Court within weeks.Small business aid. Three major federal aid programs for small businesses are no longer accepting new applications.The Paycheck Protection Program, which provided more than $798 billion in forgivable loans to 8.5 million small businesses and nonprofits, ran out of money in May.A program that awarded grants specifically to restaurants used up its entire $28.6 billion pot in July, just two months after it opened. It sent money to more than 100,000 restaurants but fell well short of meeting the demand. The program had received at last 278,000 applications totaling more than $72 billion in requested funds.The Shuttered Venue Operating Grant program has also stopped taking new applications. As of this week, it had provided 11,774 grants worth $9.5 billion to theaters, music venues and museums. Those that received grants may still be eligible to apply for supplemental funding.Struggling small businesses can also still apply for loans from the Small Business Administration's Economic Injury Disaster Loan program.   Yet passage of that legislation isn't guaranteed, and while the economy is in better shape than it was earlier in the pandemic, many families are still struggling to get back on their feet.  These relief measures remain in effect.  Enhanced child tax credits  Tens of millions of American families will receive four more monthly child tax credit payments as part of Congress' enhancement to the program for 2021.  The next installment — up to $300 for each child up to age 6 and $250 for each one age 6 through 17 — will be sent next week.  Eligible families will receive a total of up to $3,600 for each child under 6 and up to $3,000 for each one age 6 to 17 for 2021. That's an increase from the regular child tax credit of up to $2,000 for each kid up to age 17.  Parents will receive half their credit this year and can claim the other half when they file their 2021 taxes next year.  The full enhanced credit is available for heads of households earning $112,500 and joint filers making up to $150,000 a year, after which it begins to phase out. For many families, the credit then plateaus at $2,000 per child and starts to phase out for single parents earning more than $200,000 or for married couples with incomes above $400,000.  More low-income parents are eligible for the child tax credit this year because the Democrats' March relief package made it fully refundable.

Paycheck Protection Program,"Participating in PPP increased banks' risk appetite, study finds",PaymentsSource | The Latest,PaymentsSource,"Participating in PPP increased banks' risk appetite, study finds  Banks that embraced their role as a conduit for Paycheck Protection Program loans were likelier to take more risk elsewhere, according to new research by three accounting professors. “Anytime you have that amount of money flowing through the bank, it’s going to affect behavior,” one of the authors said.  Banks that funneled more government-backed loans to struggling small businesses during the pandemic may have been emboldened to take greater risks in other lending decisions, according to a new academic study.  The Paycheck Protection Program, which launched in April 2020 and wrapped up in May 2021, is widely seen as a successful use of the financial system to relay government assistance to the needy in the middle of a crisis.  But there is evidence that this stockpile of essentially risk-free, low-yielding loans led bank executives to take bigger chances in search of higher profits that they sacrificed as a result of their participation in the PPP, according to the study by three accounting professors, which will be published in the journal Management Science.  The findings go beyond past research that found banks take on more risk when they receive direct government support, such as during the 2008 financial crisis, one of the co-authors, Sarah Stuber of Texas A&M University, said in an interview.  The new paper could give regulators more insight into how banks behave when they are tasked with providing a conduit for government benefits that are targeted for others, she said.  “Anytime you have that amount of money flowing through the bank, it’s going to affect behavior,” Stuber said. “It’s hard for an entity to act purely as a pass-through.”  Stuber and her colleagues — Hailey Ballew at Rice University and Allison Nicoletti at the University of Pennsylvania — looked at banks’ risk appetite in the second and third quarters of last year. Hundreds of billions of dollars in PPP loan proceeds, which are guaranteed by the Small Business Administration, passed through banks both in 2020 and this year.  In 2021 alone, more than $219 billion in PPP loans passed through banks, which equaled about 79% of the total amount approved this year, according to SBA data.  The study’s authors found that a bank with an average PPP participation rate had a relative quarterly increase in risk-weighted assets of 0.32% during the second and third quarters of 2020. That increase compared with an average 0.7% decline in risk-weighted assets across the industry, including those banks that did not participate as fully in the program, they found.  “What we think was probably going on is, when you take on risk-free loans, it increases the risk they perceive they could take on,” Stuber said.  Industry experts who reviewed the study were quick to say that safe PPP loans yielding little profit required bringing on some riskier, higher-earning assets to balance a bank’s portfolio.  Chris Nichols, director of capital markets at $40.3 billion-asset SouthState in Winter Haven, Florida, said that as the pandemic unfolded, banks feared the worst. But when the economy creaked open later in the year, banks suddenly found themselves with more deposits than they needed and had to put the additional capital to work.  While Nichols called the study’s thesis interesting and said the analysis was well run, he argued that it does not fully explain the behavior of banks last year.  “Except for maybe a small handful of bankers, few in our industry ever considered that because of PPP we had additional risk-bearing capacity that we could ‘use’ in other areas,” Nichols said.  Nichols did say that the study helps explain one ripple effect from the Paycheck Protection Program. Because the PPP funneled nearly $800 billion in liquidity to small businesses, it made them safer borrowers on other loans. Small companies may have turned to traditional bank loans in order to meet their supply chain needs, for instance.  The study comes with one major caveat. The authors found that risk-taking appears to have been held in check at some of the larger banks that adopted new Current Expected Credit Losses accounting standards, known as CECL, last year.  Regulators drafted the new requirements to force banks to deepen their analysis of possible losses over the entire life of a loan, rather than set aside allowances for any problems over a much shorter period.  All banks with more than $50 billion of assets had to adopt the new CECL standards at the start of 2020. About 116 smaller financial institutions opted to follow suit at the same time, according to the advisory firm BKD.  The study is among the first to show how the new accounting standards can shape behavior. The authors found no significant relationship between PPP participation and risk-taking for banks that have adopted CECL.  An increase in risk-taking, Stuber explained, would require additional loan-loss reserves under the tougher accounting standards.  The authors state in the paper that further study is needed to draw clearer conclusions about the impact of PPP participation on risk-taking outside of the program. But Stuber said it is clear that lending patterns shifted as a result of the big sums of money that went through the banks.  “It’s important for policymakers to understand how they administer these programs and the effects on banks as we see more stimulus programs coming out,” she said."

Employee Retirement Income Security Act,Lawsuit Accuses Sponsor of DuPont Pension Plan of ‘Sleight of Hand’,PLANADVISER | Latest News,PLANADVISER,"Rebecca Moore  Lawsuit Accuses Sponsor of DuPont Pension Plan of ‘Sleight of Hand’  Plan fiduciaries are accused of misleading participants in benefits communications and interfering with benefits by arbitrarily assigning them the status of 'terminated' due to a spinoff.  In yet another lawsuit resulting from a series of mergers and spinoffs involving the Dow Chemical Co., E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Co., and Corteva Inc., pension plan participants say plan fiduciaries’ arbitrary interpretation of plan terms and the classification of employees as “terminated” resulted in them receiving lower pension benefits than they were promised.  For background, on December 11, 2015, E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Co. (Historical DuPont) and Dow Chemical Co. (Historical Dow) announced a plan to merge and restructure their businesses. Under the terms of the restructuring, the two entities were to merge temporarily under a single entity, DowDuPont Inc., and then separate out their product lines into three independent companies. This resulted in three agriculture, materials science and specialty products companies: Corteva Inc., Dow Inc. and DuPont de Nemours Inc., respectively. Historical DuPont emerged from the spinoffs as a subsidiary of Corteva.  Background for First Named Plaintiff  According to the complaint, as of June 1, 2019, the Pension and Retirement Plan, formerly titled the U.S. DuPont Pension and Retirement Plan, including all pension liabilities, was moved to Corteva. The plaintiffs allege that this move was specifically designed for the new Dow and the new DuPont to divest themselves of any future funding obligations and liabilities of the plan. Corteva is now responsible for funding and administration of the pension benefits for more than 100,000 participants even though the majority of active participants have never worked in the businesses now operating as Corteva.  A spinoff created a new parent company that took on the historical DuPont name and logo and most of the historical DuPont businesses. The spinoff also created a nominal subsidiary of the newly formed Corteva that was dubbed the continuation of the historical DuPont, although it retained none of that venerable DuPont’s business operations. Nonetheless, Corteva was deemed the sponsor of the pension plan, even as the employees of DuPont nearly all remained in the same location and engaged in the same activities.  One of the named plaintiffs intended to take early retirement at the age of 58 under the rule of 85 (age 58 plus 27 years of service) feature of the plan that has been available to all DuPont employees for more than 30 years. The complaint points out that he made numerous relocations, causing his wife to sacrifice pension benefits over her career, and he turned down other job offers all toward the goal of achieving early retirement at age 58.  However, the plaintiff learned that according to Corteva’s interpretation of the spinoff as it relates to the plan, the spinoff terminated his employment from the plan sponsor (i.e., historical DuPont/Corteva) even though he continued in the same job at the same location and was not “terminated” in the typical way that termination is understood by an employee.  When the plan was frozen in 2018—stopping accruals for additional years of service—the plaintiff’s earliest opportunity to apply for unreduced early retirement under the Rule of 85 was age 58.5. As long as he was not fired and did not leave his employment before he reached the age of 58.5, he had been promised and he believed that he would be eligible for an unreduced early retirement benefit.  The complaint also notes that DuPont has maintained an employee information/data portal called “DuPont Connection” for many years where employees can review their benefits information. However, in early 2020, the plaintiff received a notification that employees were now directed to the “Corteva Connection” portal, as the pension information would no longer be visible in DuPont Connection.  Navigating through the information, the complaint says the plaintiff was shocked to see his earliest unreduced retirement date was changed to 2034, versus his planned date in 2027. Per the current company position, any retirement prior to the 2034 date would result in a 5% reduction for each year. So retiring in 2027, as he planned, would result in a 35% lifetime reduction. The complaint says he was never told that this would be the case before or after the spinoff.  Around November 2018, when the announcement was made that Corteva would be taking over the plan, the plaintiff reviewed the 2018 Q&A document that was shared with all DowDuPont employees. He alleges that the language in this Q&A did not make clear the underlying impact of the changes intended by DowDuPont management.  “DuPont and Corteva’s plan to cut off early retirement benefits for workers such as himself was not in any way apparent from the Q&A document, which instead obscured this critical fact,” the complaint says, adding that the plaintiff “believes that the majority of employees would not and still do not understand the intent of the companies to take away promised early retirement benefits through a corporate sleight of hand that ostensibly transformed current employees into terminated employees.”  When the plaintiff first learned that he was “terminated” as a result of the spinoff of Corteva, he requested approval to qualify for benefits under the Optional Retirement at Involuntary Termination provision of the plan. He says this request was denied, and he was told he was not terminated but, rather, “divested” and therefore the optional retirement provision did not apply.  Background for Second Named Plaintiff  The second named plaintiff was informed—just eight days before the close of the spinoff, and just shy of one year from reaching age 50—that his position was declared “excess” and he was terminated for lack of work. During a meeting with a human resources (HR) manager, he was presented with a career transition program (CTP) package and was told that he was entitled to an enhanced pension under the plan due to being involuntarily terminated for lack of work.  According to the complaint, the HR manager handed the plaintiff a matrix showing the percentages of retirement based on age at payment start date and years of service. He then circled 55%, which correlated to 49 years of age and 19 years of service, the plaintiff’s age and service as of July 31, 2019, the date of his termination. The complaint notes that although the plaintiff was informed of his termination on May 23, 2019, his termination date was set at July 31. He was also told that his percentage benefits would increase the longer he waited after termination to commence benefits.  Based on this, the plaintiff waited about a year, until he was close to 50, to apply for his benefits to commence effective July 1, 2020. However, Corteva sent him a pension estimate calculation statement listing him as “deferred vested” and only entitled to 25% of his normal retirement benefit rather than the 60% he had expected to receive upon turning 50.  The plaintiff submitted an appeal explaining that he had been terminated for lack of work under the CTP, but Corteva responded that effective on the date of the spinoff, June 1, 2019, Corteva began sponsoring the heritage DuPont CTP and that the plaintiff’s CTP was under the new DuPont CTP. The plaintiff says he had never been informed of a new CTP.  The plaintiff filed a benefits appeal, and it was denied. The retirement plan committee found that as a result of the spinoff, the plaintiff “voluntarily terminated” his employment because his employment continued under the new DuPont after the date of the spinoff, even though he never worked after May 23, 2019. It further found that because the spinoff occurred before the official termination date, the plaintiff was not terminated for “lack of work.”  The Claims  In the lawsuit, the plaintiffs, on behalf of a class of current and former participants in the plans, seek clarification that the plan’s administrative committee acted arbitrarily and capriciously in interpreting the plan to extinguish their right to age into an early retirement or Rule of 85 unreduced early retirement under the plan. The complaint says nothing in the plan document, the summary plan description (SPD) or any communications provides for any other interpretation of the Rule of 85 benefit and, in fact, that the documents and communications state the contrary.  The lawsuit also says the defendants breached their fiduciary duties under Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) Section 404 by actively and repeatedly misinforming and omitting material information about the plaintiffs’ ability to age into an early retirement or Rule of 85 unreduced early retirement benefit under the plan in the years and months leading up to the spinoff.  The defendants are also accused of breaching their fiduciary duties by actively and repeatedly misinforming participants and omitting material information about the employees’ ability to obtain optional retirement benefits at certain percentages tied to their age at the time of commencement of benefits if they were terminated for lack of work.  “The defendants, acting separately and in concert, have discharged, expelled and otherwise discriminated against the plaintiffs and the class for purpose of interfering with their attainment of early retirement pension benefits under the plan” in violation of ERISA Section 510, the complaint alleges.  The complaint also includes a Pennsylvania state law claim to enforce the promises made to participants.  Other Related Actions  Last year, a federal district court judge dismissed a lawsuit that challenged the legality of the spinoff of the DuPont plan. The judge gave the plaintiffs a chance to amend their claim, but their second attempt was also dismissed.  However, earlier this year, a judge moved forward a case against DuPont that claimed confusing benefit statements caused a participant to miss out on years of payments.  Morningstar has announced a set of new initiatives aimed at bringing additional transparency and performance analysis to the model portfolio investment market.  The firm says it is pursuing this goal as model portfolios continue to gain popularity among investors. Citing its existing reporting on the model portfolio landscape, Morningstar says the number of options for investors is rapidly growing, with demand being driven by the potentially greater flexibility and customization that models offer, particularly when it comes to tax management.  One particular initiative Morningstar is undertaking in this area is the anticipated fourth quarter launch of its popular Morningstar Star Ratings within the model portfolio space. The firm is also aiming to double the qualitative and forward-looking Morningstar Analyst Rating coverage of model portfolios by the end of 2021.  Morningstar says it is assigning the star rating to model portfolios to help investors better sift through the large and growing universe of model portfolios. The star rating for model portfolios will follow the same core methodology that is used to assign ratings to managed investments in other universes such as mutual funds and separate accounts. Under this methodology, Morningstar will assign ratings to model portfolios based on their past risk-adjusted returns versus their category peers. Given that model portfolios are hypothetical in nature, Morningstar is adapting the core star rating methodology to ensure the star rating for model portfolios upholds a high standard for reliability.  Another new goal is to “surface new data points that provide foundational information on model portfolios, such as assets under advisement [AUA], asset allocation targets and ranges, and rebalancing frequency,” according to the firm’s announcement.  To this end, Morningstar has also published a new in-depth analysis of the model portfolio landscape. The analysis suggests a “conservative estimate” of $315 billion in assets currently follow model portfolios, based on data submitted to Morningstar by 28 model providers. In reality, the analysis suggests, the figure is potentially substantially higher, as many model providers cannot accurately track assets following their paper models or those invested through model marketplaces. As of the end of June, BlackRock is the largest provider, with almost $70 billion of assets, while the 10 largest providers have around 75% of the overall market share.  The analysis shows the number of models available continues to surge, as Morningstar collected data on more than 1,000 new models in less than a year, with only a modest increase in outreach, which the firm says suggests that they’re growing fast.  Beyond the research effort, Morningstar is also launching a new “Model Exchange” functionality for Morningstar Advisor Workstation subscribers, enabling them to research, compare, apply and subscribe to approximately 2,100 models.  Michael Herbst, director of models and institutional investments for Morningstar, says the firm intends to bring similar levels of transparency to model portfolios as is available for mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs).  “Models is a space our own Morningstar Investment Management group knows well from their years of making them available to advisers, and as investors demand more personalization, Morningstar is answering the call by putting independent research and data in investors’ hands and equipping financial professionals with the means to advise and empower their clients,” Herbst says."

"Capital Adequacy of Bank Holding Companies, Savings and Loan Holding Companies, and State Member Banks",Milton Friedman’s Long-Run Impact,Hoover Institution | Defining Ideas,Hoover Institution,"Milton Friedman’s Long-Run Impact  There has been a lot of discussion in the past few years about how much impact Milton Friedman’s ideas and work have had on economic thinking and economic policy. Some critics of Friedman have exaggerated it. For example, in 2018, Larry Kramer of the Hewlett Foundation, in a scathing attack on Friedman, wrote:  Government regulation may persist in many arenas, but in the years since [Friedrich] Hayek’s and Friedman’s economic philosophy—now called “neoliberalism”—became ascendant, it has reshaped everything. Fiscal policy, monetary policy, labor policy, trade policy, welfare policy, and industrial policy, to name only a few, have been fundamentally altered in line with the ideas of Hayek and Friedman and their followers.  Kramer went on to say why he thought this influence was negative.  Other critics have claimed the opposite: that Friedman’s long-run impact is virtually zero. In “The End of Friedmanomics,” a particularly nasty recent article in the New Republic, Zachary D. Carter, a writer in residence with the Omidyar Network and the above-mentioned Hewlett Foundation, quotes Columbia University economist Jeffrey Sachs as follows: “Almost nothing remains of his intellectual legacy. It has proven to be a disastrous misdirection for the world’s economies.” Unfortunately, Carter doesn’t elaborate on Sachs’s point. But clearly we have two extremes here. The Hewlett Foundation, it appears, is open to a range of viewpoints on Milton Friedman as long as they’re negative.  The truth is somewhere between the two extremes. While Milton Friedman has not had as much effect on economic thinking and policy as many of us free market advocates would like, he has nevertheless had a huge impact.  On economic thinking, the following of Friedman’s ideas have held up well: that monetary policy is potent; that a contraction in the money supply between 1929 and 1933 helped put the “Great” in “the Great Depression”; that inflation “is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon”; and that there is no long-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment. On economic policy, his attribution of inflation to monetary policy rather than to unions or corporate monopolies has strengthened the hand of the Federal Reserve in fighting inflation. In the early 1970s, he opposed President Nixon’s economy-wide price controls as a way to end inflation. Although he was arguably in the minority in the economics profession at the time, most economists today would oppose such controls and their opposition has so far helped dissuade the federal government from imposing them. His activism in the late 1960s and early 1970s to end military conscription bore fruit: the draft was ended on January 27, 1973.  Friedman’s Effect on Monetary Policy  One of Friedman’s first big victories was on the importance of monetary policy. In a 1969 Newsweek column, when the majority of economists held the Keynesian view that monetary policy was impotent and fiscal policy was potent, MIT economist Paul Samuelson wrote:  [T]here is no sight in the world more awful than that of an old-time economist, foam-flecked at the mouth and hell-bent to cure inflation by monetary discipline. God willing, we shan’t soon see his like again.  God wasn’t willing. By the mid-to-late 1970s, Friedman’s view about the importance of monetary policy in affecting the inflation rate had become dominant. In fact, even Samuelson came to believe that monetary policy was potent. He never admitted that his view had changed or that Milton Friedman’s work had had any influence on him, but in his famous textbook, Economics, you can track his change in viewpoint edition by edition. Indeed, in my Wall Street Journalobituary of Samuelson, I did track it. By the 1985 edition, Samuelson and co-author William D. Nordhaus wrote that money “is the most powerful tool and useful tool that macroeconomic policy makers have.”  This change in economists’ views has been long-term. It’s fair to say that the majority of economists today believe that monetary policy is the main contributor to inflation.  Perhaps Friedman’s earliest break with the mainstream economics profession was his book, co-authored with Anna J. Schwartz, A Monetary History of the United States, 1867–1960. In this work, which took years of careful digging, Friedman and Schwartz meticulously measured and reported changes in various measures of the money supply. Their longest chapter is on the Great Depression. In that chapter, they showed that between 1929 and 1933, the money supply had fallen by 30 percent and that that fall had contributed mightily to the Great Depression. While a majority of economists today may not accept their view that the drop in the money supply was the most important cause of the Great Depression, economists who study that era certainly give the money supply factor a lot of weight.  In his speech as outgoing president of the American Economic Association, given in December 1967, Friedman argued, contrary to the Keynesian consensus, that there is no long-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment. The reason for the short-run tradeoff, he argued, is that when there is unexpected inflation, unemployed workers are temporarily fooled into accepting a wage that is high in dollar terms but is not high when adjusted for inflation. When many workers do this, the unemployment rate falls temporarily. But when workers learn that their higher wage in dollar terms buys fewer goods and services than they had thought, some quit or, if laid off, take longer to find a job because they now understand that their higher dollar wage does not buy more goods. So the unemployment rate creeps back up. The only way to keep the unemployment rate down with inflation, argued Friedman, was for the Federal Reserve to keep increasing inflation by increasing the rate of growth of the money supply. In that way lay out-of-control inflation. That’s one reason Friedman advocated not an activist monetary policy but a stable one.  Friedman’s preferred monetary policy was for the Federal Reserve to increase the money supply by 3 to 5 percent annually. One of the major regulations that Friedman had for years advocated ending was Regulation Q, which made it illegal for banks to pay interest on checking accounts. When this regulation was repealed in 1986, checking accounts became a closer substitute for savings accounts. That meant that money moved more easily between the two and that meant, in turn, that it became harder for the Fed to target a particular measure of the money supply. Ironically, therefore, Friedman’s victory on Regulation Q led to problems with the monetary policy he advocated. Nevertheless, the Federal Reserve and other central banks seem to understand the importance of stable growth in the money supply.  Friedman’s Effect on Non-Monetary Economic Policy  In his 1962 book Capitalism and Freedom, written with the assistance of his wife, Rose D. Friedman, Friedman has a chapter titled “The Role of Government in a Free Society.” At the chapter’s end, he lists fourteen activities that the government was involved in at the time and says that all should be abolished. The activities include government price supports in agriculture, minimum wage laws, rent controls, Social Security, and government licensing requirements for people to engage in various occupations. Notice that none of these five has been abolished. Indeed, Presidents Johnson, Nixon, and Carter, who were in power after 1962, increased Social Security payments by much more than the inflation rate. So much for Larry Kramer’s claim that Friedman has had a huge influence on overall economic policy. More’s the pity, as the British say.  That’s the bad news. But the good news is that on four of the fourteen, there has been a major shift to economic freedom. Friedman called for ending the Texas government’s control of the Texas oil industry’s output; that’s gone. Friedman called for ending government setting of maximum interest rates on checking and savings accounts; that’s gone. He wanted to end “regulation of transportation by the Interstate Commerce Commission.” President Carter ended it and the ICC itself was abolished in 1995. As a bonus, Carter ended the Civil Aeronautics Board’s restrictions on airline travel and, ultimately, the CAB itself. Was Milton Friedman a major player on these three issues? Only on the setting of maximum interest rates on checking and savings accounts. He had long advocated repealing Measure Q and he was one of the few people doing so. Nevertheless, on these issues, he got his way.  What’s the fourth policy issue in 1962 on which Friedman succeeded? Friedman called for ending conscription in peacetime. It ended in January 1973. Moreover, in the 1960s Friedman became more radical; in a Newsweek column in December 1966, at the height of the Vietnam War, he advocated ending conscription immediately. And the draft ended two years before the war ended. Friedman deserves a lot of credit for this. He once wrote that conscription was the only issue on which he had lobbied congressmen. He was also a very effective member of President Nixon’s Commission on an All-Volunteer Armed Force, which was formed in March 1969, less than three months after Nixon took office, and which delivered its report in early 1970. As Friedman wrote in Two Lucky People, the commission had fifteen members, five of whom started out against the draft, five of whom favored the draft, and five of whom were on the fence. When the commission delivered its report, fourteen of the fifteen favored abolishing the draft. Given Friedman’s notable ability to persuade, there’s a high probability that Friedman influenced at least some of those nine commissioners who switched to being anti-draft. The fifteenth, Roy Wilkins, executive director of the NAACP, explained in a letter to Nixon that he had been ill and had missed five meetings. Notably, though, Wilkins wrote, “I would like to endorse the basic idea of moving towards an all-volunteer armed force, and to express my hope that you will be able to take steps in the near future to reduce reliance on conscription.”  Whether you think Milton Friedman’s effect on economic thinking and economic policy was good or bad—I’m in the former camp—the fact is that he had much less effect than some of his harshest critics have claimed and much more effect than other of his harshest critics have claimed. He left a major mark on economists’ thinking about monetary policy, the Federal Reserve’s contribution to the Great Depression, the large role of money supply increases in causing inflation, and the long-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment.  Arguably, his most important policy victory, and one to which he was a major contributor, was ending military conscription. We have now had almost half a century without the draft. For that, many millions of young, middle-aged, and even old Americans, some of whom might be his critics, owe him gratitude."
Regulation Best Interest,"Brokers' Bells and Whistles Can Harm Investors, SEC Panel Finds",Barron's | Daily Analysis,Barron's,"Brokers' Bells and Whistles Can Harm Investors, SEC Panel Finds  Digital cues from online brokers or financial advisors have the potential to harm investors, by coaxing them to make decisions that end up costing them money.  That was a major takeaway from a Securities and Exchange Commission panel on Thursday meant to address the rise of new ways to buy stocks and options. The other major takeaway was that policing those digital cues is a complicated—if not impossible — task.  Members of the SEC Investor Advisory Committee met virtually to discuss the agency’s plans to address the “behavioral design of online platforms.” The SEC is entering into a public comment period before proposing new rules to set up guardrails for online trading and advisory apps.  Robinhood Markets (ticker: HOOD), the brokerage app drawing millions of new investors, was mentioned several times at the meeting. But it’s not the only one that could be affected by new rules. Robo-advisors like Wealthfront and Betterment, and even more traditional financial advisors, will need to take heed as the SEC considers rules.  “Are we going to try and take this very complex area that is multidimensional and try and fit it into a regulatory framework we have today?” asked Heidi Stam, a member of the Investor Advisory Committee and a former Vanguard executive. “Or do we need to really think differently about it, and develop something that has a different approach. And the reason I ask this is that, historically, efforts to regulate or require specific designs — particularly in digital settings — have been impossible or disastrous, or both. Better education of investors is very difficult. We put a lot of information out there, but it’s rarely absorbed, and not often effective.”  The digital bells and whistles that new stock-traders encounter today are not easy to put into a box. Stephen Hall, the legal director and securities specialist of nonprofit Better Markets, told the committee that he thinks that current regulations already are applicable. In particular, he cited Regulation Best Interest (Reg BI), which makes brokers act in the best interest of their customers when they make recommendations.  “At least some of these platforms are either directly or indirectly making recommendations to their users within the meaning of regulation best interest,” Hall said. He mentioned Robinhood during his statement, arguing that the company uses behavioral prompts to increase trading, which increases its revenue.  “These features are designed alone, and in combination to bombard investors with manipulative signals that entice or even pressure them into trading as much as possible, regardless of how it might affect their financial health,” he said. Robinhood allows users to “scratch-off” a free stock on their app, among other design features that critics have pointed to.  In a statement, a Robinhood spokesperson said “we disagree with any characterization of our current products and features as ‘gamified’ or as amounting to a call to action to trade.”  “Applying Regulation Best Interest to self-directed trading platforms like Robinhood would be inconsistent with a fundamental premise of Reg BI, namely that it does not apply to ‘self-directed or otherwise unsolicited transactions by a retail customer,’” the spokesperson added.  Not everyone on the panel was convinced that regulators could draw a line between a recommendation and a simple design enhancement meant to make investing more engaging. Steven Shu, a behavioral finance expert and a principal at a firm called Digital Nudgng Tech, said that digital notifications reminding them of smart investing advice could convince investors to make better decisions. He called them “just-in-time prompts”.  Dan Egan, the director of behavioral finance and investing at robo-advisor Betterment, said that design choices could influence investor behavior in both good and bad ways.  “We as designers of these apps probably underestimate the relative influence that we have over how people think about and understand and make decisions inside them,” he said. Even deciding whether to show green and red colors for gains or losses, or to highlight one-day moves instead of longer-term stock changes, can impact an investor’s mind-set. Betterment uses prompts to remind investors about the tax consequences of trades, for instance. The company tested prompts about taxes and found it had a substantial impact on behavior — “it reduced the number of allocations changes made by about 90%,” he said.  He’s concerned that regulators could get too specific about how investment apps should be designed.  “One of the things that I’m wary of is the idea of regulating specific design elements,” he said. “There will always be design, you’d have to pick a font, you’d have to pick a color. I think it’s very important that we encourage both consumer innovation and design and experimentation. We don’t want to get too specific about what people have to do.”  Write to Avi Salzman at avi.salzman@barrons.com  Brokers’ Bells and Whistles Can Harm Investors, SEC Panel Finds  Digital cues from online brokers or financial advisors have the potential to harm investors, by coaxing them to make decisions that end up costing them money."

HIPAA - Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act,Something Borrowed: This Psychologist's Command Performance,MedPage Today | Latest Headlines,MedPage Today,"Greg Holmes  Something Borrowed: This Psychologist's Command Performance  (MedPage Today) -- The reasons not to go to Mary's wedding seemed overwhelming.

The reasons not to go to Mary's wedding seemed overwhelming.  She was neither a family member nor even a close friend. She had, in fact, been my psychotherapy patient several years back. The very notion of attending her wedding raised the issue of professional boundaries: wasn't it inappropriate for me to see a patient outside of the office setting?  My professors had made a big deal of this during my clinical training, admonishing my class to maintain strict divisions between our personal and our professional lives. Even then, I'd wondered, whom are you protecting? The client or yourselves?  Then there was the question that other wedding guests were sure to ask: ""How do you know Mary?"" I've blurred a boundary or two in my time, but how could I answer that without violating the HIPAA regulations about patient confidentiality?  On the other hand, I knew it meant a lot to Mary to have me at her wedding. As her therapist, I'd sat with her for many hours, trying to help her undo the damage of a traumatic childhood and her difficult relationships with the men in her prior marriages.  I'd witnessed her emotional journey -- an internal trial by jury in which, at first, she'd accepted the prosecution's charge: ""there's something wrong with you.""  With my encouragement, she'd engaged in a retrial, this time with a defense attorney (myself) at her side, and we'd carefully examined the evidence. Over time she'd reached her own verdict -- not guilty -- and had gradually freed herself from her psychological prison.  My own inner dialogue about attending the wedding went like this:  My inner child (a whine, rising to a scream): ""I don't want to go! It's my day off! I want to go to the beach!""  My Catholicized superego: ""You should go. It's only one day! Stop complaining! Think about what it would mean to her!""  This went on and on -- until suddenly, out of the blue, came a thought I didn't expect: I need to be there.  When the wedding day arrived, it was the best summer day ever -- one you dream about, the one you grieve for after the sun disappears into Lake Michigan. I'd lost the wedding invitation, but I felt confident of the time and place: Mary's farmette on a short thoroughfare just outside of town.  I turned my aging Subaru down that road, and sure enough, there it was -- a modest older home set before a red barn, with a bouquet of gaily colored balloons by the dirt driveway. I parked my car with others in a roped-off area and ambled toward the barn, where people sat around tables, eating and talking loudly.  Darn it! Did I miss the ceremony?  I squelched that thought. You're here. Sit down and grab yourself some lunch. All you need to do is say hi to Mary, meet her new husband, and skedaddle!  The banquet table groaned under classic Midwestern fare: high-carb, high-fat offerings, punctuated at the end by an enormous cake. I scooped up a hot dog and baked beans, added a side of heavy potato salad, grabbed a beer, and asked some people if I could join their table.  They gave me a hearty welcome and introduced themselves. There was Amy and her husband from Detroit, Sam and Ginny from town, and Paul and his wife all the way from Cincinnati. Then came the moment I'd been dreading.  It was Paul's wife from Cincy who spoke: ""And how do you know Grandpa?""  ""Grandpa?"" I murmured, then plunged into a flurry of apologies: ""I'm so sorry! I thought this was a wedding that I'm supposed to be at!""  To their credit, no one laughed -- at least, not out loud. I even heard someone say, ""Everyone makes mistakes."" (As I tell my patients all the time.)  Still apologizing, I got up, dumped my remaining food in a trash can and fled. Instead of a big piece of cake for dessert, I ate a huge slice of humble pie.  I knew it, I fumed, sitting in my car. Why did I ever decide to come?  After awhile, though, that strange feeling came over me again: I need to be at Mary's wedding.  I felt certain that her house was nearby; how many more celebrations could there be on this small road today? My self-instructions resumed: just show up, say hi, and skedaddle.  I started the car and drove on. Sure enough, Mary's farmette was less than a half mile away. The scene looked like a wedding should, with a makeshift stage and a big tent over a sea of folding chairs that were beginning to fill with people. I let out a huge sigh of relief.  Approaching the crowd of people, though, I could tell something was wrong. It hung so heavily in the air, I could almost smell it. I heard snippets of muttered comments: ""Mary's in her house!"" and ""Mary's crying!""  I rushed into the house -- professional boundaries be damned -- and made my way through a maze of relatives to Mary and her husband-to-be, Bob.  ""What's wrong?"" I asked.  Mary burst into tears. ""The minister was supposed to be here an hour ago,"" she sobbed, distraught and shaking. ""We can't reach her. How can I tell my family and friends?""  Suddenly I realized why I needed to be here. To comfort Mary, of course -- and something else.  ""Mary, everyone is here but the minister,"" I said calmly. ""I'll be happy to get onstage with you and Bob and officiate at your wedding ceremony. It won't be street-legal, but you can easily take care of that another day with a justice of the peace.""  Mary wiped away her tears. To her credit, she summoned up the courage to walk out to the assembled family and friends and tell them the new plan.  In 10 minutes everyone was seated, and the three of us were arranged onstage. As I looked out on the crowd of radiant, expectant faces, HIPAA was the last thing on my mind.  The show did go on -- made all the more glorious by Mary's and Bob's mutual declarations of love. In addition to the usual marriage stuff, I made note of the couple's courage in committing to something greater than themselves. I threw in a favorite Rumi poem: ""Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing and rightdoing, there is a field. I'll meet you there."" If they could meet there, I told them, they would experience the happiness they were seeking in their marriage.  Finally, I proclaimed, ""And now, under the authority bestowed upon me by absolutely no one, I pronounce you husband and wife!""  The audience laughed, cried, and applauded. No one asked the inevitable question about how I knew Mary.  In my own mind, though, another question took its place: how did I know that I needed to be here?

HIPAA - Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act,Biden announces new measures to fight COVID-19. Here's what we know.,MSN | Other News,MSN,"Biden announces new measures to fight COVID-19. Here's what we know.  Start the day smarter. Get all the news you need in your inbox each morning.  What did the administration order and what's the authority to do so?  Biden said the Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration would issue an “emergency temporary standard” that mandates employers with 100 or more workers require the vaccine or conduct weekly testing of unvaccinated employees.  The administration is also requiring employers with more than 100 employees to provide paid time off to allow workers to get vaccinated or recover if they are ill after the shot.  OSHA has the power to issue those standards until a permanent standard is developed when “workers are in grave danger” from exposure to toxic substances or agents or to new hazards, according to its website.  For example, in June, it issued an emergency temporary standard requiring health care employers to provide N95 masks and other personal protective equipment to some employees and ensure social distancing. The orders are subject to challenge in the U.S. Court of Appeals.  More: 'Patience is wearing thin': Biden rolls out vaccine requirements that will affect 100 million workers  Who does the vaccine mandate cover?  The vaccine mandate covers all private employers with more than 100 employees, meaning it will generally apply to corporations and other large businesses. In all, more than 80 million workers are affected.  If workers choose not to be vaccinated, they would have to pass a weekly COVID-19 test to come to work.  Biden singled out some companies that already have vaccination requirements: United Airlines, Disney, Tyson Foods and “even Fox News.”  More: Won't get a COVID-19 vaccine? Some bosses may charge you $20 to $50 more for health insurance on every paycheck  Who does it not cover?  Smaller private businesses with fewer than 100 people are not included in the mandate. However, Biden issued vaccination mandates for other workers as well. They include most federal government workers, all 17 million workers at nursing home facilities and hospitals that receive Medicare and Medicaid funds and staff of federal Head Start and Early Head Start programs.  In all, Biden said the mandates cover about 100 million Americans, or two-thirds of the U.S. workforce.  Biden also called for COVID-19- vaccines to be required to attend sports arenas, large concert halls and other venues where large groups of people gather. Yet he did not single out outdoor football games.  Who counts as a federal worker?  The vaccine order for the federal government requires all federal executive branch workers to be vaccinated as well as all employees of federal contractors.  It covers about 90% of approximately 4 million federal workers but does not apply to non-executive branch employees such as members of Congress or judicial employees.  In addition, the order covers federal departments and agencies that have already started to implement vaccination mandates: the military and other service members under the Department of Defense, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Indian Health Service, and the National Institutes of Health.  Previously, Biden in July required federal employees show they have been vaccinated or undergo regular testing.  When will this start?  It was unclear on Thursday when exactly the requirements would take effect. OSHA is expected to issue the rule ""in the coming weeks,"" according to the White House, and implementation could follow a timeline similar to those in the public and private sectors. In some cases, those have ranged from weeks to months.  The exact timeframe will be dependent on the rulemaking process.  What about HIPAA? How can employers ask for this?  The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, know as HIPAA, prevents health care professionals from sharing private health information without the patient's permission. It does not apply to those outside of a health care setting, such as businesses and individuals, asking questions about a person’s vaccine status, experts say.  The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission previously issued guidelines in May that allow employers to require on-site employees be vaccinated, provided they don't violate civil rights and disability laws. In July, the Department of Justice also announced that federal law does not prohibit federal agencies or private businesses from mandating vaccines.  What are the punishments for businesses that don’t comply?  Businesses that do not comply with Biden’s directive will face “substantial fines” up to $14,000, according to a senior administration official. The Labor Department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration will enforce the fine.  This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Who's covered by Biden's new vaccine mandates?

Volcker Rule,"Mr. B. Prasanna – PDAI Chairman’s speech delivered at the 17th Annual Conference of FIMMDA-PDAI on April 15, 2016 at London",FIMMDA | Reports and Speeches,Fixed Income and Money Market and Derivatives Association of India (FIMMDA),"X  Mr. B. Prasanna – PDAI Chairman’s speech delivered at the 17th Annual Conference of FIMMDA-PDAI on April 15, 2016 at London  Speech of Shri. B. Prasanna, PDAI  Chairman at the    17TH FIMMDA –PDAI  ANNUAL  CONFERNCE     April 15, 2016, Hotel Hilton Metropole, London.      Respected    Shri  H  R  Khan  ,  Deputy  Governor,  Reserve   Bank  of  India,  Other    respected  dignitaries    from  the   Reserve  Bank  of  India,  my    fellow board    members  from   FIMMDA  and  PDAI,  My  dear    friends  and  colleagues   from the industry,   Ladies and Gentlemen.   Let  me  first  wish  you  a  very    warm  welcome    to  yet   another  edition  of  the  FIMMDA  –  PDAI  annual   conference, very aptly titled “  Indian Markets – towards   globalization”.   This is that time of the year – When we   all  take  a  step  back  to  take  a  look  at  the    unfinished   agenda   of the year gone by – When we all deliberate to   identify and remove bottlenecks   in the development of   our  market.  It  is  of  course  a great   sweetener    for  us  to   have these discussions in the lovely city of London…    The PDAI chairman speech is always one of the   toughest   things  to  deliver  .  Coming  sandwiched  between  a   brilliant  recollection  of  the  last  years  activities  of   FIMMDA by our Chairman Shri Venkatesh’s and a power   packed  speech  packed  with  forward  looking  guidance   and  announcements  for  the  markets  from  our  beloved   Shri  HR  Khan,  who  all  of  you  are  no  doubt  waiting  to   hear…I  clearly  don’t  want  to  stand  in  your  way.  But   attempt I shall…    Primary  dealers  are  supposedly  the    torch  bearers    for   improving bond market liquidity and hence I will choose   bond  market  liquidity  both  from  a  domestic  and  global   perspective as my theme.    Liquidity in bond markets in FY17 was characterised by   a    peculiar  lack  of  a  clear  direction  .  It  suffered  from   spurts  of  global  volatility,  lack  of  FPI  flows  and  smaller   range  of  yields  resulting  in  the  market-wide  metrics   related  to  volumes  and  turnover  looking  worse  than  in   FY15.  Let me elaborate.   The   total  trading volumes    in  dated  government  bonds   had  increased  from  59  Lac  Cr  in  FY13  to  91  lac  Cr  in   FY15, (a CAGR of nearly 24% in YoY terms) only to fall   back to Rs 75 Lac Cr in FY16. The average daily trading   volume  increased  from Rs.  24,460  Cr in  FY13  to   Rs 38,645 Cr in FY15 but decreased to Rs 35,522 Cr in   FY16.  The    share  of  Primary  dealers    though  has   remained intact at very healthy 19% like last year. This   number had substantially increased from 16% in FY13.   In terms of the overall turnover ratio   the status of the   Indian  bond  market  amongst  its  Asian  peers    has   remained  stagnant  this  year.  The  ratio  had  improved   dramatically from 1.3 to 2.47 in last 8 years only to fall   back to 2.03 in FY16. We are currently still better than   countries  like Malaysia  (ratio  of  1.37)  but  slipped  lower   than  countries  like  Indonesia  (2.5)  and  Thailand  (2.6)   while we continue to be lower than South Korea (2.7).    In  terms  of    dispersion  of  trading  volumes  ,  while  the   less than 15 year buckets had a very healthy incremental   turnover  ratio  of  around  21 times,  the  longer  buckets   trade  approximately  at  a  mere  1.5  times  thus  skewing   the overall turnover ratio down. So while PDs have been   doing  their  bit,  the    market  requires  long  term   investors  to  access  secondary  market    for  their   investment  needs  so  that  intermediaries  like  us  can   perform  our  roles  better.  I  restate  the  need  for  a   regulatory  nudge    for  the  same  that  might  help  bring   about improvement in market liquidity.     We  seem  to  have  fared  marginally  better  on   Concentration  risk    though.  The  volume  share  of  the   single most traded security has now decreased to 34% in   FY16 from 45% in FY15 while the share of top five traded   securities has marginally decreased from 79% in FY15 to   77%  in  FY16.  There  is  an  urgent  need  to    consolidate   issuances   and have a   higher threshold of outstanding   for each bond   so that more bonds become liquid. Out of   the 86 securities  that  are  outstanding  currently,   only 50 securities have an outstanding of more than Rs   50,000  Cr.  Buyback  and  switches  within  the  same   maturity  bucket  could  also  be  planned  actively  by  the   RBI  and  the  government  to  help  remove  kinks  in  the   curve  and  help  kick-start  liquidity  across  the  entire   curve.      As far as global development is concerned, there are a   few  main  drivers  of  change  that  have  been  shaping   liquidity  in  global  financial  markets.    Amidst  global   uncertainty following the 2008 crisis, central banks, and   regulatory  bodies  and  in  large  parts  financial  investors   have adopted a policy of risk avoidance.    First was the Volcker Rule (a part of the Dodd-Frank   Wall  Street  Reform  and  Consumer  Protection  Act).   This  rule  was  designed  to  prohibit  activity  that  may   expose  banks  to  high-risk  strategies  that  could  lead  to   substantial  financial  losses,  the  primary  idea  being  to   prevent banks from engaging in speculative trades while   using  customer  deposits  and  federal  deposit  insurance.   The rule also seeks to prevent proprietary trading under   the guise of hedging. Here, banks are required to provide   detailed information for supervisory review to classify the   trade as a hedge.   In tandem with the Volcker Rule, was the European   equivalent popularly known as MiFID II  . Traders have   likened  these  fixed  income  market  rules  to  effectively   forcing them to play poker with their cards showing, with   the  end  result  that  markets  may  become  more  illiquid   and investors pay more for their trades.    Secondly,    regulatory  guidelines  towards  the   implementation  of  Basel  III  norms  by  itself    have   resulted  in  an  increase  in  the  capital  requirements  of   banks.   Thirdly,    the  Basel  Committee  on  Banking  Supervision   (BCBS)    has  released  its  new  guidelines  under   “Fundamental  Review  of  the  Trading  Book”    in   January  2016  which  amongst  others  includes  a    Shift   from VaR to Expected Shortfall (ES) framework  . ES is   the  expected  loss  once  VaR  has  been  breached.  It  is   expected that ES risk is on average 1.4x of VaR leading   to an increase of 40% in Capital requirement of 40%.   These developments are recreating the landscape of our   financial markets, mainly resulting in the way that banks   and other intermediaries transact with each other. While   the    Volcker  rule  focusses  on  a  concerted  effort  to   improve  the  culture  and  governance  of  trading    the   rule also takes a hard line on the   role of the supervisor   accepting nothing short of substantial proof that the rule   is being adhered to.    As a result of these measures, the trading volumes of   bonds  as  a  percentage  of  outstanding  Bonds    have   declined from a peak of 3.5% in 2005 to 1.8% currently   while  the  total  traded  volume  has  fallen  by  25%  in  the   last 8 years.   Inter-dealer trades   have declined from over   USD  80tn  in  2012  to  just  above  USD  50tn  in  2016.   Trading  revenues  and  ROEs    at  some  of  the  large   financial  institutions  have  declined.  Increasingly    many   of the proprietary trading activities are moving away   from banks to hedge funds.   With  this  backdrop;  I  see  the  following  risks  to  our   domestic markets in the near term:   a)   Lower Foreign bank participation -   With the impact   of capital charges, and legislation; treasuries of foreign   banks  may  not  be  inclined  to  continue  with  their   current limits on trading positions   b) As    domestic  Banks’    NPA  recognition  norms  fructify,   focus  could  be  on  balance  sheet  repair    as  they   eschew  market  risk.  Further,  the    reduction  in   HTM/SLR  and  introduction  of  LCR    might  create   demand  for  low  duration  assets  while  high  duration   still forms almost 100% of the incremental supply.      c) Greater emphasis may be laid on   “Agency” business   opportunities over principal trades.   These factors are likely to further lead to a   fall in market   liquidity  and  increase  in  bid-ask  spreads    chiefly  as   banks  who  have  been  active  risk  takers  in  the  past   withdraw liquidity from the capital markets.   Long term   funds,  primary  dealers  and  asset  managers  are  well   suited to fill that funding gap.   However, it is not only a   matter of ability and willingness. We need to create the   right incentives   and at the same time   remove barriers   that  constrain  the  participation  of  these  players.  While   regulation  can  be  an  effective tool  for  creating  financial   stability and restoring and maintaining confidence in the   financial  markets  they  could  also  have  the  unintended   effect  of  sometimes  discouraging  or  even  prohibiting   long-term market development.   To paraphrase the words used by our very own governor   in one of his earlier speeches…   “The policy of being too   cautious is the greatest risk of all”  . Now people in the   bond  market  can  now  appreciate  this  more  than  ever   before.   There  is  one  another  issue  that  needs  regulatory   attention at the highest levels. This is the enormous   impact  SDL  yields  have  been  having  on  the  overall   micro structure of yields in the economy.   The Gross   supply of SDL at 2.95 Lac cr was a YOY growth of 23%   while the net supply of SDL of Rs 2.6 lac cr was nearly   40% of total net SLR supply. Not only had the   average   SDL  spreads    shot  up  from  around  25  bips  at  the   beginning of the year to around 80 bips at the end, but   the   variances of cut-off in SDL issuances on the same   date   have been as high as 20 bips.   The high correlation   between SDL spread and gsec yield curve spread   was   evidenced by the long bond spread moving from 30 bips   at  the  beginning  to  50  bips,    running  counter    to  the   accommodative  stance  of  the  RBI.  Given  all  this,  the   pricing of SDLs in cutoff, size of the auctions the timing   of these auctions  require more active management.  The   sanctity  and  transparency  of  the  SDL  borrowing   calendar    on  the  lines  of  G-Sec  borrowing  should  be   aimed for.       As far as the   overview of PDAI activities   is concerned I   am not going to elaborate here but suffice to say that it   has been a somewhat   joyous   year for all of us with a very   proactive RBI engaged with us for increasing the product   suite available in the market as well as to respond to the   concerns of the PD industry. With Currency futures and   a higher SBL/GBL limits the RBI has surely made the PD   business model a lot stronger than what it was without   them.    We    thank  the  Reserve  Bank  for  all  the  above   measures   as well as for seeking constant feedback from   market for implementing financial market reforms.   A few   more of our demands   are being pursued and I hope that   the  Reserve  Bank  will  make  some  favorable   announcements very soon. We hope that the pace of new   market reforms will only accelerate as we go forward.        Thank you.   "
Fair Housing Act,"I’m a tenant in a new apartment complex. We need a handicap-accessible ramp, but the building manager won’t respond. What can I do?",MarketWatch | Retirement Planning,MarketWatch,"I’m a tenant in a new apartment complex. We need a handicap-accessible ramp, but the building manager won’t respond. What can I do?  I’m in my 80s and rent an apartment in a newly built development. It’s advertised as a handicap-accessible building but there’s no ramp for residents at the side entrance we use. My neighbor is legally blind and has trouble navigating those steps. I’ve alerted the building manager but that hasn’t helped. Should I file a complaint? If so, how and to whom?  D.S., Manchester, N.H.   Dear D.S.,  Yes, you may want to file a complaint. But before you go down that path, there are other ways to convey your concerns that could prompt a resolution.  If the building manager continues to ignore you (I assume you’ve made at least two polite but firm attempts to describe the problem), shift your attention to the developer. Developers usually value their reputation in the community, so you wield some leverage.  “The next step after the building manager is to reach out to the developer or owner of the property,” said Lynne Clay, managing attorney at Disability Rights Center-NH in Concord, N.H. “Put things in writing so that you have a record if you go further” and submit a formal complaint to state or federal agencies.  To underscore your seriousness, send your demand letter to the developer using Return Receipt. It provides the sender with proof of delivery, including the recipient’s signature.  In the letter, summarize the problem and insert relevant facts such as the number of residents who use the side entrance—and the percentage of those residents who are elderly and have disabilities. Focus on verifiable data. Avoid inflammatory language or extraneous editorializing.  “If you can make the case that more than one tenant wants this ramp, your landlord is more likely to pay attention,” said Ann O’Connell, legal editor at Nolo, a provider of do-it-yourself legal resources in Berkeley, Calif.  In crafting the letter, she suggests wording such as, “According to fair housing laws and given the location of our units next to the side entrance and very far from the front entrance, you need to make reasonable accommodations that will allow us to use the side entrance safely.”  To add urgency, mention any “near miss” incidents or injuries that have occurred. For example, write, “I’ve tripped three times walking the long way from the front entrance, and my neighbor stumbled the other day trying to use the stairs at the side entrance.”  You may want to call your town government’s building code inspector or ask tenant rights groups or city or county officials for help. Local codes are sometimes more strict than state or federal rules, O’Connell says.  In addition, there are federal laws that may apply such as the Fair Housing Act that prohibits discrimination because of disability (among many other factors). Your legally blind neighbor qualifies for protection under this law.  “Because it’s new construction and it’s a multifamily building, the law requires it to have at least one handicap-accessible entrance without stairs,” Clay said. “But if the building has another entrance primarily used by tenants, you can ask for that entrance to have a ramp.”  A developer might still refuse and urge you and your neighbor to use the main entrance (assuming it has a ramp), even if that’s less convenient for you.  “In that case, the tenant can file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development or ask for a reasonable accommodation of a side entrance ramp and pay for it,” Clay said. “If the tenant offers to pay for it, the landlord has to let them do that.” (If the housing is federally funded, the owner may be responsible for paying for the ramp.)  If you’re unwilling or unable to pay for the ramp, submitting a complaint to HUD’s Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (FHEO) is fairly straightforward.  “The easiest way to do that is to fill out the online form,” O’Connell said. “You can also call or use the mail. The FHEO can make your landlord take action.”  Worried about retaliation from an angry landlord? The law is on your side. It’s illegal under the Fair Housing Act for anyone to retaliate against you for your advocacy, Clay says.  “Tenants are sometimes afraid to assert their rights,” she added. “We hear it all the time that they’re worried the landlord will evict them if they say anything. So we let them know about the anti-retaliatory provisions under the Fair Housing Act.”"

This Letter from America was originally scheduled for publication in August, it follows the revelations published here about a crucial decision from Scotland’s Court of Sessions, by Lord Sanderson. It is a US perspective of Mr Trump and his relationship with certain timeshare moguls, just like the story of his involvement in Scotland, it does not paint a very good picture. This article also briefly shows the efforts and role of the “Regulators” in the U.S. So it ties in with another article published this week. For those of you who are not familiar with the “Timeshare Mogul” named, click on the YouTube link and watch the “Queen of Versailles”, you will then ask yourself the question, “Is this where my money has gone?”  Trump and Timeshare  By Irene Parker  U.S. names like Trump and Biden are not mentioned in polite company without jeopardizing relationships with friends and family. There are many reasons to like or dislike both named politicians, but those on the side of consumer timeshare protection have reason to question former President Trump’s biased stance on timeshare sales and marketing practices.  Charles reported earlier this week on questionable lending as pertaining to the Trump Organization’s acquisition of the Turnberry Resort and golf course in Scotland. A look back to what happened in 2016 provides some political timeshare history.  Pictured above is candidate Trump in 2016 on the stump. Westgate owner David Siegel of Queen of Versailles fame is seated to Mr Trump‘s right. The Queen of Versailles documentary describes the couple’s 90,000 square foot Orlando home that includes Mrs Siegle’s 5,500 square foot clothes closet. The documentary took Best Director at Sundance some years back.  I have no objection to great wealth, but a number of Westgate owners have reached out to me or our volunteers, unable to exit their timeshare. Some have debilitating and chronic health conditions. One couple, the husband, age 90, was forced to default on their timeshare week because Westgate objected to their paying their broker his $800 commission after the broker had found a buyer offering $500. I know of no honest timeshare resale broker (those who charge no upfront money to list a timeshare for sale) that will accept a listing for Westgate units because it is written into the contract that Westgate is entitled to 50% of the commission.  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is the federal agency in the U.S. that seeks to protect consumers, along with the Federal Trade Commission. The CFPB in 2016 fined Wells Fargo $100 million when agents opened unauthorized accounts to reach performance goals and compensation incentives.  Westgate underwent a two-year investigation concerning sales and marketing practices. According to Buzzfeed News, Diamond Resorts was the next likely candidate to come under CFPB scrutiny. Not only was the Westgate investigation dropped almost immediately after the 2016 presidential election, the CFPB was all but dismantled.  REGULATORS ARE LOOKING INTO AMERICA’S LARGEST TIMESHARE SELLER March 18, 2016  https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/matthewzeitlin/financial-regulators-are-looking-into-americas-largest-times  According to the CFPB’s civil investigative demand (CID), the Westgate investigation looked into possible violations by salespeople involved in “the sale and financing of timeshares engaged in, or are engaging in, acts or practices in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act, the Fair Debt Collection Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act and the Fair Credit Billing Act.”  Where is the CFPB today?  WASHINGTON, D.C. – The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) today issued a report highlighting legal violations identified by the Bureau’s examinations in 2020. The report also highlights prior CFPB supervisory findings that led to public enforcement actions in 2020 resulting in more than $124 million in consumer remediation and civil money penalties. June 29, 2021  https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-report-highlights-supervisory-findings-of-wide-ranging-violations-of-law-in-2020  Anyone who is unable to resolve their dispute, after reaching out to their timeshare company, and feels they experienced unfair and deceptive practices, should file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the state Attorney General where the contract was signed, and the Better Business Bureau. It is only because of a volume of complaints that Timeshare Sales appeared at #7 on the FTC’s list of Top Ten Scams at $17.4 million and Timeshare Resales (We have a buyer for your timeshare scams) #10 at $12.5 million.  https://www.aarp.org/money/scams-fraud/info-2020/ftc-top-scams.html  Inside Timeshare will say this again, there is nothing wrong with the concept of timeshare, for some, it is a good option and suits their vacation needs, but as always it is the way it is sold and managed. The consumer is just the proverbial “Cash Cow” to be milked of their cash by the greed of the industry.  Inside Timeshare welcomes your views on this subject, Inside Timeshare can see many similarities in what is happening in the timeshare world, not just in Europe but in the US, Canada, Australia and elsewhere. Eventually what happens in one place will happen elsewhere, it is an international problem, so we invite you to use our contact page or just leave a comment. Have a great weekend."

Who can blame them? No one likes carting around multiple devices. But in many cases, these personal devices are not managed and not secured. Cybercriminals are becoming more sophisticated each day and they certainly make no exception to hacking data that is supposed to be HIPAA compliant.  In the healthcare industry it is common for physicians and clinicians to access patient data using personal devices. While convenient, this behavior can create security issues. In a time when security breaches are frequent in the healthcare industry, IT teams must find balance between security and employee experience. Denis O'Shea can be available to discuss the steps that can be taken and what Mobile Mentor has learned working with hospitals making the transition.  https://www.linkedin.com/in/denisosheamobilementor/  Website: https://www.mobile-mentor.com/  Media contact: Beth Tallent, beth@tallentpr.com  CIA Expertise on Security  Peter Warmka  Former CIA Senior Intelligence Officer  Counterintelligence Institute  Today's hackers design and effectively use a variety of social engineering or human hacking techniques to manipulate targeted insiders to undertake actions which will compromise security systems. Unfortunately, most employer provided security awareness training programs focus on basic phishing attempts delivered via an email containing a link or attachment that, if clicked on or opened, will result in malware being uploaded into the network. The fact of the matter is that today's hackers are much further advanced in utilizing a variety of communication channels available to them including social media platforms. Companies fail to understand how susceptible their employees can be to targeting by threat actors based upon the information publicly posted and shared in their social media profiles.  Former CIA senior intelligence officer, Peter Warmka is available to add his expertise to your coverage of security breaches and company hackings. Criminal groups are using espionage strategies to secure information and execute hacking and ransomware attacks. Warmka can address how threat actors use ordinary people to gather information from common sources (like a LinkedIn profile) in order to gain access to target organizations. He can also talk about what your audience can do to prevent it and what organizations can do to protect themselves.  https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterwarmka/  Website: https://www.counterintelligence-institute.com/  Media contact: Beth Tallent, beth@tallentpr.com  9/11 Human Interest  Shirley Dreifus  Author, Owner of 9/11 Flag  Strategic Communications Group  ""It took me years to recover from the attacks on our nation and years to write this book chronicling the mostly unknown history of the 9/11 Flag.

Truth in Lending Compliance,CFPB alleges online lender violated 2016 consent order,Buckley Sandler | Resource Center Search,BuckleySandler,"CFPB alleges online lender violated 2016 consent order  Federal Issues CFPB TILA CFPA Regulation Z Online Lending  On September 8, the CFPB filed a complaint against a California-based online lender (defendant) for allegedly violating the terms of a 2016 consent order related to false claims about their lending program. As previously covered by InfoBytes, the 2016 consent order alleged the defendant engaged in deceptive practices by misrepresenting, among other things, the fees charged, the loan products that were available to consumers, and whether the loans would be reported to credit reporting companies in violation of the CFPA, TILA, and Regulation Z. According to the September 8 complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, the defendants continued with much of the same illegal and deceptive marketing that was prohibited by the 2016 consent order. Among other things, the complaint alleges that the defendants violated the terms of the consent order and various laws by: (i) deceiving consumers regarding the benefits of repeat borrowing; and (ii) failing to provide timely and accurate adverse-action notices. The Bureau seeks injunctive relief, damages, consumer restitution, disgorgement, and civil money penalties. In addition, the Bureau asks the court to permanently enjoin the defendants from committing future violations of the CFPA, the Bureau’s 2016 Consent Order, ECOA, or any provision of “Federal consumer financial law.”"

As at 30 June   2006, I have completed two reviews   during the year and reported on them to   the Minister, and I have another five   reviews underway as follows:   •  review into Tax Office audit   timeframes (Report to Minister,   19 July 2005);   •  review into aspects of the Tax Office management of litigation (Report to Minister   18 May 2006);   •  review of the potential revenue bias in private binding rulings involving large   complex matters (commenced August 2005);   •  reviews into the Tax Office’s ability to identify and deal with major, complex issues   within reasonable timeframes. These reviews comprise three ‘case study’ reviews   (commenced October 2005) with potential for a fourth, summary report. The three   case studies comprise:   –  a review into the Tax Office’s handling of living away from home allowances   (LAFHAs),   –  a review into the Tax Office’s handling of service entity arrangements, and   –  a review into the Tax Office’s handling of research and development syndication   arrangements;   •  follow up review into the Tax Office  ’s implementation of recommendations   included in reports prepared by my Office (commenced 29 June 2006).   Page 1   Part 1: Overview   A full list of all reviews completed since my Office was established is on my website,   www.igt.gov.au.    How long particular reviews take can be a reflection of their breadth, the extent to   which they raise issues which are challenging for the Tax Office, and also the level of   cooperation afforded. The review of the Tax Office's management of litigation, for   example, was a particularly long review and absorbed more than a third of my total   resources for more than a year.   Relationships with the Tax Office during the year have been considerably strained in   respect of some reviews, with several legal opinions being sought on either issues   identified in a review or on the scope of my powers to obtain information generally.   The Treasury, as coordinator of the Treasury portfolio, has also been involved in some   of these matters. Obtaining legal opinions on my information gathering powers has   been undertaken jointly and cooperatively across the three Treasury portfolio agencies.   The review into aspects of the Tax Office’s litigation management, in particular, could   have proceeded more smoothly and quickly had the Tax Office shared information   with me earlier than it did, especially legal opinions it sought in connection with the   review. However, these difficulties have not been the universal experience. Tax Office   cooperation and responsiveness has been satisfactory in other instances.   The impact on my Office’s productivity has been frustrating; but I believe that these   experiences will generally turn out to be positive and provide a new platform for   relationships into the future. The legal opinion on my information gathering powers   both uphold the strength of my ability to undertake reviews as intended by the   Parliament and clarify the approaches which should be followed by all concerned.    In 2004 the Commissioner and I agreed a protocol aimed at promoting a cooperative   working relationship between us and our agencies. It should have enabled a   partnership to develop around the mutual aim of improving tax administration. As a   result of the difficulties experienced this year and with the clarifying legal opinion we   have jointly sought, I expect that we will undertake a joint review of the protocol and   that this will enhance my ability to undertake my role into the future in a timely,   efficient and cooperative way.   The opinion sought by the Tax Office from the Solicitor-General and Chief General   Counsel of the Australian Government Solicitor, in connection with the review of the   Tax Office litigation management will also, I believe, have a significant positive   influence on future tax administration and perhaps even more broadly. The opinion,   together with a supplementary opinion, is included in my report on the Tax Office   Management of Litigation (which was released in August 2006).   Page 2   Part 1: Overview   Aside from formal reviews I have continued to have regular correspondence and   discussions with the Commissioner and other senior tax officials which have resulted   in improved administration in a number of areas. Examples include the withdrawal of   a misleading Draft Public Ruling and Tax Office consideration of improvements to   applications for private binding ruling proformas. The Aggressive Tax Planning (ATP)   area has been particularly open to discussion and suggestions for change, and has   made improvements to the way the Tax Office has communicated with and reached   resolution with some employee benefit arrangements (EBA) taxpayers.   Public sector stakeholders   The Commonwealth Auditor-General and the Commonwealth (and Taxation)   Ombudsman also scrutinise the Tax Office from their perspectives. My office is in   regular contact with these agencies.   The roles of each agency are different and we have sought to communicate with each   other regularly to ensure that there is no unnecessary duplication of the reviews we   conduct.   Community and private sector stakeholders   I am pleased to report that community and private sector stakeholders continue to   maintain a strong interest in my role and contribute to my work programme. I meet   with all key private sector stakeholders at least twice a year to consult with them in   formulating my ongoing work programme. In 2005-06, I have found that establishing   specific stakeholder reference groups for some particular reviews has provided   valuable insights into taxpayers’ direct experiences of Tax Office approaches.   While my role is to identify systemic improvements in tax administration, I welcome   the opportunity to obtain information from individual taxpayers, tax agents, and   community leaders, including parliamentarians.   I have also found that the ongoing development of relationships with tax   administrators and my equivalents in other countries has enabled an invaluable   sharing of experience and comparison of ideas and approaches to both generic issues   in tax administration, and as input to particular reviews.   Issues and changes in tax administration   As indicated earlier, 2005-06 has been another eventful year in tax administration   including:   Page 3   Part 1: Overview   •    the change of Commissioner (from 1 January 2006) and other senior leadership   changes at the Tax Office;   •  the implementation of key recommendations included in the   Report on aspects of   income tax self assessment   (ROSA);   •  the implementation of promoter penalty laws;   •  the commencement of a comprehensive inquiry into tax administration by the Joint   Committee on Public Accounts and Audit (JCPAA); and   •  the Government’s reiteration of its intention to introduce a new regulatory   framework for tax agents.    These are all important and influential developments. The full impact of some of these   events is yet to be understood.   As a keen observer of these events and processes, and through undertaking an   ongoing programme of reviews during the year, I am in a position to identify issues of   both concern and optimism for the future of tax administration in Australia.   The Tax Office’s administration of the law   I am concerned about how the Tax Office approaches interpretation and   administration of the law in some significant cases and the potential for this issue to be   systemic.   The Treasury has recently summarised the role of the Tax Office as being   ‘… through a   statutorily independent commissioner, responsible for the general administration of (tax) laws,   which includes their enforcement and providing advice on the Commissioner's interpretation of   them as well as the day-to-day collection of revenue.’   I would only add that the community   expects this role to be undertaken objectively and without fear or favour from any   quarter.   In this respect, I notice that the Tax Office from time to time seems to blur the gap   between tax policy and administration. I note that the Commissioner has recently said   that the role of the Tax Office   ‘... is that of implementing the policy objectives of tax   legislation through the management of administration systems.’   I have noted signs that the   Tax Office is willing to interpret and administer the law in line with its view of policy   even if the letter of the law does not adequately support it.    There are also examples of the Tax Office being prepared to challenge court decisions   because the law does not deliver policy intent (even though legal advice from the   Page 4   Part 1: Overview   Solicitor-General says that the correct path in that situation is to seek changes to the   law).    The policy intent behind the law is an important input to interpretation; but in the final   analysis it cannot supplant the law itself. Propping up deficient tax law because it does   not deliver policy intent should not be part of the Tax Office’s approach. It is important   for the Commissioner to reaffirm to his staff and to the community that his role is that   of administration and enforcement of the laws as enacted by Parliament and   interpreted by the courts.   The Commissioner notes his role of bringing to the Government’s attention matters   where the tax laws are not operating in accordance with their policy intent. That is as it   should be; but the extent to which it is done and is effective depends largely upon a   strong commitment to the rule of law on behalf of the Tax Office. To again quote the   Commissioner,    ‘This requires a high level of integrity and courage where the proper   application of the law produces an inconvenient result.’   I am concerned that achieving necessary fixes to tax laws can be a long and sometimes   fruitless pat"

Havlik will be succeeded by Greg Ruppert, who currently reports to Havlik and serves as EVP and leader of FINRA's National Cause and Financial Crimes Detection Program (NCFC), on November 1st. She will remain an adviser to Ruppert to assist with the transition until the end of the year.  Since 2018, Havlik has led the Department of Member Supervision through transformational changes that created a single national examination and risk monitoring program designed to better align FINRA’s regulatory resources and expertise with the risk profiles and complexities of its member firms. Under the strong and diverse leadership team she brought together, the department has implemented a number of initiatives to improve the identification and mitigation of risks to investors, and to provide practical and actionable guidance to member firms so they can evaluate and improve their controls and compliance programs. Havlik has been a leading advocate for creating an inclusive culture at FINRA; one in which underrepresented groups have a voice, and diversity, in all its permeations, is valued and leveraged.  “Our mission of investor protection and market integrity depends on effective oversight, from early risk monitoring to timely guidance for firms to in-depth investigations of potential misconduct,” said FINRA President and CEO Robert Cook. “Bari has led a remarkable transformation in our risk monitoring and examination programs that will continue to strengthen FINRA’s ability to supervise our member firms effectively and efficiently. I am grateful for her leadership in that effort and in the important work that Member Supervision undertakes every day to safeguard investors and markets. Greg is an innovative leader who has demonstrated exceptional collaboration across FINRA in his time at the head of our national cause and financial crimes program. I am confident that he will build on Bari’s accomplishments and further enhance FINRA’s oversight capabilities.”  “I couldn’t be more proud of the team and everything they have accomplished over the last few years.” said Havlik. “It’s been an honor to work with so many dedicated professionals who work tirelessly to protect investors and the integrity of the markets.”  “I look forward to working with Robert and the rest of the senior leadership team to continue to strengthen our regulatory program in service of FINRA’s mission, with the benefit of the strong team and inclusive culture that Bari has created. Protecting investors is at the heart of our work, and I’m excited about this leadership opportunity and the ability to have a greater impact.” said Ruppert.  Havlik’s most significant accomplishment, the creation of a unified examination and risk monitoring program at FINRA, integrated previously separate financial, business conduct, and trading examination functions to drive more effective oversight, foster greater consistency, and eliminate duplication. Under this initiative, FINRA’s member firms are now grouped according to the businesses in which they are engaged, while FINRA matches its resources and expertise to those groups to build more targeted, better informed oversight.  Also under Havlik’s leadership, Member Supervision’s investigatory and surveillance functions were combined into NCFC, another single national program, designed to promote more consistent reviews, improve intelligence sharing, and enhance fraud detection capabilities. She created a new function dedicated to driving the strategic adoption of data analytics and technology solutions and capabilities, amplifying Member Supervision's ability to focus on, and more effectively review, high priority compliance risk areas, protect investors, uphold market integrity and manage risk. She drove program changes to mitigate risks associated with complex issues like cybersecurity and private placements.  Havlik has also been committed to building an expert, innovative, and collaborative team in Member Supervision, focusing on the identification and elevation of new leaders and talent within the team. She has been committed to hiring, developing and promoting a more diverse workforce. She also led the training and development of the Member Supervision team as part of the creation of a single national program from 14 office locations.  Greg Ruppert previously was Senior Vice President and Chief of the Financial Crimes Risk Management Group at Charles Schwab. Prior to that role, he was a Special Agent with the FBI for 17 years, working on complex financial investigations, terrorist financing, terrorism, and cyber threats. Ruppert is also Professor of Practice for the University of the Pacific, School of Engineering and Computer Science’s Data Science Master’s Program. Ruppert holds a Juris Doctorate and B.A. from the University of the Pacific.  About FINRA  FINRA is a not-for-profit organization dedicated to investor protection and market integrity.

Fair Housing Act,"I’m a tenant in a new apartment complex. We need a handicap-accessible ramp, but the building manager won’t respond. What can I do?",MarketWatch | Futures Stories,MarketWatch,"I’m a tenant in a new apartment complex. We need a handicap-accessible ramp, but the building manager won’t respond. What can I do?  I’m in my 80s and rent an apartment in a newly built development. It’s advertised as a handicap-accessible building but there’s no ramp for residents at the side entrance we use. My neighbor is legally blind and has trouble navigating those steps. I’ve alerted the building manager but that hasn’t helped. Should I file a complaint? If so, how and to whom?  D.S., Manchester, N.H.   Dear D.S.,  Yes, you may want to file a complaint. But before you go down that path, there are other ways to convey your concerns that could prompt a resolution.  If the building manager continues to ignore you (I assume you’ve made at least two polite but firm attempts to describe the problem), shift your attention to the developer. Developers usually value their reputation in the community, so you wield some leverage.  “The next step after the building manager is to reach out to the developer or owner of the property,” said Lynne Clay, managing attorney at Disability Rights Center-NH in Concord, N.H. “Put things in writing so that you have a record if you go further” and submit a formal complaint to state or federal agencies.  To underscore your seriousness, send your demand letter to the developer using Return Receipt. It provides the sender with proof of delivery, including the recipient’s signature.  In the letter, summarize the problem and insert relevant facts such as the number of residents who use the side entrance—and the percentage of those residents who are elderly and have disabilities. Focus on verifiable data. Avoid inflammatory language or extraneous editorializing.  “If you can make the case that more than one tenant wants this ramp, your landlord is more likely to pay attention,” said Ann O’Connell, legal editor at Nolo, a provider of do-it-yourself legal resources in Berkeley, Calif.  In crafting the letter, she suggests wording such as, “According to fair housing laws and given the location of our units next to the side entrance and very far from the front entrance, you need to make reasonable accommodations that will allow us to use the side entrance safely.”  To add urgency, mention any “near miss” incidents or injuries that have occurred. For example, write, “I’ve tripped three times walking the long way from the front entrance, and my neighbor stumbled the other day trying to use the stairs at the side entrance.”  You may want to call your town government’s building code inspector or ask tenant rights groups or city or county officials for help. Local codes are sometimes more strict than state or federal rules, O’Connell says.  In addition, there are federal laws that may apply such as the Fair Housing Act that prohibits discrimination because of disability (among many other factors). Your legally blind neighbor qualifies for protection under this law.  “Because it’s new construction and it’s a multifamily building, the law requires it to have at least one handicap-accessible entrance without stairs,” Clay said. “But if the building has another entrance primarily used by tenants, you can ask for that entrance to have a ramp.”  A developer might still refuse and urge you and your neighbor to use the main entrance (assuming it has a ramp), even if that’s less convenient for you.  “In that case, the tenant can file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development or ask for a reasonable accommodation of a side entrance ramp and pay for it,” Clay said. “If the tenant offers to pay for it, the landlord has to let them do that.” (If the housing is federally funded, the owner may be responsible for paying for the ramp.)  If you’re unwilling or unable to pay for the ramp, submitting a complaint to HUD’s Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (FHEO) is fairly straightforward.  “The easiest way to do that is to fill out the online form,” O’Connell said. “You can also call or use the mail. The FHEO can make your landlord take action.”  Worried about retaliation from an angry landlord? The law is on your side. It’s illegal under the Fair Housing Act for anyone to retaliate against you for your advocacy, Clay says.  “Tenants are sometimes afraid to assert their rights,” she added. “We hear it all the time that they’re worried the landlord will evict them if they say anything. So we let them know about the anti-retaliatory provisions under the Fair Housing Act.”"
Paycheck Protection Program,SBA has forgiven more than half of all PPP loans,Portland Business Journal | Portland News,Portland Business Journal,"SBA has forgiven more than half of all PPP loans  The vast majority of 2020 PPP loans are now forgiven, according to the latest SBA data.  The Small Business Administration has officially forgiven — in whole or in part — more than half of the nearly 11.5 million Paycheck Protection Program loans made across 2020 and 2021.  The SBA has officially made forgiveness payments on 6,059,574 PPP loans as of Sept. 5, according to SBA data, or about 53% of all PPP loans. That is up from 46% of all PPP loans as of Aug. 15, the last time the SBA updated its forgiveness numbers.  That includes roughly 4.4 million million payments made on the 5.13 million PPP loans the SBA made during the initial 2020 wave of the program, or about 86% of all 2020 PPP loans. So far, about 4.5 million PPP borrowers in that round have applied for forgiveness — although that means more than 600,000 business owners have yet to apply, even as they will have to start making payments on unforgiven loans if they miss the deadline.  Details about PPP forgiveness  The vast majority of the PPP borrowers that have not yet submitted applications for forgiveness have loans of $50,000 or less, according to SBA data. About 3 million PPP borrowers with loans of $50,000 or less have submitted for forgiveness — about 85.7% of the roughly 3.5 million that fall into that category.  Out of the 28,913 PPP borrowers with loans of $2 million and above in 2020, 26,306 have submitted for forgiveness, or about 91%.  Meanwhile, the number of 2021 loans that are getting forgiven continues to grow quickly. Out of the 6.36 million PPP loans, SBA has made about 1.66 million forgiveness payments — or about 26% of all 2021 PPP loans. That is up from the 17% of 2021 PPP loans that have been forgiven in whole or in part as of Aug. 15, according to the latest SBA data.  So far PPP borrowers with less than $50,000 loans have submitted the most forgiveness applications, with 32.1% of all loans under that amounted submitted for forgiveness. Of the 6,418 PPP borrowers with loans of $2 million or more in 20201, just 13.8% have submitted for forgiveness.  Across both 2020 and 2021, PPP borrowers got all or nearly all of their loans forgiven, with PPP borrowers under $50,000 getting on average 98.6% of their loans forgiven, while those with loans of $2 million or more getting 99.4% of their loans forgiven.  Chris Hurn, founder and CEO of online lender Fountainhead, said the forgiveness process so far — and SBA’s new direct forgiveness portal it launched in July — has gone well.  He said so far Fountainhead has submitted 88% of its 2020 PPP loans for forgiveness as well as nearly half of its PPP loans from 2021. He said he anticipates at least 70%, and possibly up to 85%, of its PPP loans to be submitted for forgiveness before the end of 2021.  PPP and the future of SBA lending  Hurn stressed the millions of small-business owners that got PPP loans and had them forgiven will probably mean a much higher interest in SBA loan products in the future.  “There has been some fits and starts with PPP, but I think it’s maybe one of the best things they have done and will end the program on a high and leave a positive experience in the minds of the small business community. I think more of them are going to be interested in SBA loan programs,” Hurn said.  Some lenders butted heads publicly with the SBA last week over the agency's suggestion that some lenders were slow walking PPP loan forgiveness. We outlined that issue in a story here. But Hurn said SBA has clarified to lenders that it is not looking to punish lenders for not using its direct forgiveness portal.  ""Maybe they were a little heavy-handed in the message, but they have since clarified it,"" Hurn said, adding the SBA was still encouraging lenders to opt in. ""I think some of the resistance from the biggest banks about not using it is that they have already spent the money and built their own platform, and they feel it's better than what SBA has created. And they have to justify the cost that they spent.""  Meanwhile, the SBA continues to make tweaks and changes to other programs. It recently — and temporarily — suspended a rule that requires small-business contractors in its 8(a) Business Development Program to be physically located near potential project sites to be able to bid for the work.  The SBA is also preparing to make some significant changes to its EIDL program — changes that will expand who is eligible and how businesses will be able to spend loan proceeds."
US Securities & Exchange Commission,Budgeting for Health Care Costs Is a Challenge for Law Firms as COVID-19 Drags On,The American Lawyer | Top Headlines,The American Lawyer International,"Budgeting for Health Care Costs Is a Challenge for Law Firms as COVID-19 Drags On  Law firm health care claims were projected to rise to pre-pandemic levels in 2021, on the assumption that employees would resume elective procedures and more routine behavior as COVID-19 faded. Nine months into the year, health care costs have picked up, but much remains unclear for the rest of the year and into 2022.  Law firm health care claims were projected to rise to pre-pandemic levels in 2021, on the assumption that employees would resume elective procedures and more routine behavior as COVID-19 faded. Nine months into the year, health care costs have picked up, but much remains unclear for the rest of the year and into 2022.  September 10, 2021 at 05:32 PM  5 minute read  Health Care  What You Need to Know  Health costs have generally picked up at law firms.  President Biden's vaccine mandate could cause some providers to implement surcharges for people who remain unvaccinated.  Costs are expected to rise again in 2022, but uncertainty over the Delta variant could cause people to put off care again.  Much like office return plans, predicting health care costs is no easy task in a pandemic.  Law firms expected health care costs to pick up in 2021, optimistically expecting people to resume normal elective care activities with the pandemic more under control. But as the delta variant creates additional uncertainty, and new federal rules create questions, the health care line on law firms’ expense sheet remains an blurry area for the rest of 2021 and into next year.

The model portfolio gained 52.7% in 2020 and is up 46.9% in 2021, and the return since inception in late 2013 has been 3608%.  Outlook  After a strong rally to begin 2019, the cannabis sector experienced a sharp decline over the next year to unprecedented levels due to several negative developments, including the CannTrust fraud, the surprise termination of Bruce Linton as CEO of Canopy Growth, a disappointing roll-out of legalization in Canada, regulatory confusion in the U.S. regarding CBD and a slow roll-out of legalization in California, the vaping crisis and then financial turmoil and market disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The sector saw capital available to fund expansion dry up, a situation that continues to leave companies operating with negative cash flow severely challenged, as the availability is limited to stronger operators.  Cannabis stocks overreacted and put in a bottom in March 2020, and benefited from a perception that the industry offers strong growth prospects, something that wasn’t clear then. A big change was that the pandemic caused many regulators to permit previously prohibited types of retail activities, like curbside pickup and delivery. The legal market rapidly capitalized on becoming even more convenient than the illicit market, with the ability to order online. States and municipalities moved to broaden adult-use and medical access. Access to capital improved dramatically, and the leading companies began generating large and rapidly growing revenue and profits.  The strong finish to 2020 continued into 2021 after the Democrats took control of the Senate in early January, but the stocks got way ahead of themselves and have been consolidating since then. In addition to concerns that federal legalization will take a longer time than many have expected, there have been some tough comparisons to year-ago sales levels. Additionally, while several institutions embraced the sector early in the year, there has been a lull in additional interest.  There are several potential catalysts ahead, including the FDA (or Congress) providing clarity on CBD regulation, progress in the Canadian legalization that commenced in October 2018 and that is beginning to include a broader set of products and the continued growth in German and Israeli MMJ and other international markets that have been slow to develop. The adult-use implementations in California and Massachusetts for adult-use were slow to roll out but are beginning to show great improvement. Michigan and Illinois legalized for adult-use at the end of 2019, and these markets are showing strong growth that could encourage other states to legalize. Voters in Arizona, Montana, South Dakota and New Jersey all approved adult-use legalization in November, and Connecticut, New Mexico, New York and Virginia have enacted legalization through the legislative process in 2021.  The big themes ahead are likely to be continued cross-industry investment into the sector and more consolidation in Canada and in the U.S., potential federal regulatory reform (SAFE Banking Act and other more comprehensive legislation, which could eliminate 280E taxation and enable trading on higher exchanges for MSOs as well as the broad usage of credit cards for cannabis purchases), steps to enable cannabis research, the roll out of MMJ in Germany, Mexico and in Australia as well as continued advances in South America and potential adult-use legalization in Israel and Mexico, new legal cannabis implementations in AZ, MT, NJ and SD, and MMJ implementations in AL, WV and VA, possible legalization via the legislatures in DE, FL, MD, MN, NH, PA and RI and implementation of the CT, NM, NY and VT commercial programs in 2022 and VA in 2024.  After bottoming in March 2020, the cannabis sector has been in a new bull market. Many companies are generating substantial revenue and some even a profit, and liquidity is much better. The sector has transitioned away from many legacy penny stocks that had never proven that they had viable businesses towards better capitalized companies, many of which have strong management teams and substantial businesses. The investor base has also transitioned, becoming increasingly more institutional."
Fair Housing Act,"I’m a tenant in a new apartment complex. We need a handicap-accessible ramp, but the building manager won’t respond. What can I do?",MarketWatch | Careers Stories,MarketWatch,"I’m a tenant in a new apartment complex. We need a handicap-accessible ramp, but the building manager won’t respond. What can I do?  I’m in my 80s and rent an apartment in a newly built development. It’s advertised as a handicap-accessible building but there’s no ramp for residents at the side entrance we use. My neighbor is legally blind and has trouble navigating those steps. I’ve alerted the building manager but that hasn’t helped. Should I file a complaint? If so, how and to whom?  D.S., Manchester, N.H.   Dear D.S.,  Yes, you may want to file a complaint. But before you go down that path, there are other ways to convey your concerns that could prompt a resolution.  If the building manager continues to ignore you (I assume you’ve made at least two polite but firm attempts to describe the problem), shift your attention to the developer. Developers usually value their reputation in the community, so you wield some leverage.  “The next step after the building manager is to reach out to the developer or owner of the property,” said Lynne Clay, managing attorney at Disability Rights Center-NH in Concord, N.H. “Put things in writing so that you have a record if you go further” and submit a formal complaint to state or federal agencies.  To underscore your seriousness, send your demand letter to the developer using Return Receipt. It provides the sender with proof of delivery, including the recipient’s signature.  In the letter, summarize the problem and insert relevant facts such as the number of residents who use the side entrance—and the percentage of those residents who are elderly and have disabilities. Focus on verifiable data. Avoid inflammatory language or extraneous editorializing.  “If you can make the case that more than one tenant wants this ramp, your landlord is more likely to pay attention,” said Ann O’Connell, legal editor at Nolo, a provider of do-it-yourself legal resources in Berkeley, Calif.  In crafting the letter, she suggests wording such as, “According to fair housing laws and given the location of our units next to the side entrance and very far from the front entrance, you need to make reasonable accommodations that will allow us to use the side entrance safely.”  To add urgency, mention any “near miss” incidents or injuries that have occurred. For example, write, “I’ve tripped three times walking the long way from the front entrance, and my neighbor stumbled the other day trying to use the stairs at the side entrance.”  You may want to call your town government’s building code inspector or ask tenant rights groups or city or county officials for help. Local codes are sometimes more strict than state or federal rules, O’Connell says.  In addition, there are federal laws that may apply such as the Fair Housing Act that prohibits discrimination because of disability (among many other factors). Your legally blind neighbor qualifies for protection under this law.  “Because it’s new construction and it’s a multifamily building, the law requires it to have at least one handicap-accessible entrance without stairs,” Clay said. “But if the building has another entrance primarily used by tenants, you can ask for that entrance to have a ramp.”  A developer might still refuse and urge you and your neighbor to use the main entrance (assuming it has a ramp), even if that’s less convenient for you.  “In that case, the tenant can file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development or ask for a reasonable accommodation of a side entrance ramp and pay for it,” Clay said. “If the tenant offers to pay for it, the landlord has to let them do that.” (If the housing is federally funded, the owner may be responsible for paying for the ramp.)  If you’re unwilling or unable to pay for the ramp, submitting a complaint to HUD’s Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (FHEO) is fairly straightforward.  “The easiest way to do that is to fill out the online form,” O’Connell said. “You can also call or use the mail. The FHEO can make your landlord take action.”  Worried about retaliation from an angry landlord? The law is on your side. It’s illegal under the Fair Housing Act for anyone to retaliate against you for your advocacy, Clay says.  “Tenants are sometimes afraid to assert their rights,” she added. “We hear it all the time that they’re worried the landlord will evict them if they say anything. So we let them know about the anti-retaliatory provisions under the Fair Housing Act.”"

Freedom of Information Act,Biden WH/CDC Political Corruption Exposed [Weekly Update],Free Republic | News and Current Events,Free Republic,"Biden WH/CDC Political Corruption Exposed [Weekly Update]  Judicial Watch ^ | September 10, 2021 | Tom Fitton  Posted on 09/10/2021 4:47:35 PM PDT by jazusamo  Teachers Unions Gave Guidance to CDC Director on School COVID Restrictions  Judicial Watch Seeks Evidence in Lawsuit against U.S. Capitol Police for January 6 Videos  U.S. Invests Millions to Bring Racial, Ethnic “Equity” to STEM Education  Teachers Unions Gave Guidance to CDC Director on School COVID Restrictions  The all too powerful teacher unions have been  throwing wrenches  into efforts to reopen schools amid the pandemic, making all manner of demands with little regard for the students or parents.  Now we know how they have exerted their influence on public officials, particularly in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  We received  12 pages  of records showing the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) and National Education Association (NEA) influencing the director of the CDC and the White House with their own “embargoed vaccine research,” as well as school reopening policy.  Additionally, the CDC Director states that she used the unions’ language in the CDC’s school reopening policy. (Some of these emails have been previously disclosed.)  We obtained the documents through a FOIA request to the CDC asking for:  All emails exchanged between CDC Director Rochelle P. Walensky and email accounts ending in aft.org and/or nea.org.  All emails exchanged between CDC Principal Deputy Director Anne Schuchat and email accounts ending in aft.org and/or nea.org.  All emails exchanged between CDC Acting Associate Director for Communications Abbigail Tumpey and email accounts ending in aft.org and/or nea.org.  All emails exchanged between CDC Associate Director for Policy and Strategy Robin M. Ikeda and email accounts ending in aft.org and/or nea.org.  The records, some of which had been previously released, reveal:  On February. 8, 2021,  Rebecca Pringle  , president of the National Education Association (NEA),  emailed  Director of the CDC,  Rochelle Walensky  , requesting an advance copy of the CDC school-related COVID-19 guidance:  I am writing to request an advance copy of CDC school-related COVID-19 guidance that I understand are to be released this week. We will, of course, keep them confidential until they are public. I want to be prepared for any media or internal questions that come after they are released.  Any other information you can offer about the timing of their release is appreciated….  P.S. Our team will be briefing the CDC and White House staff today on our embargoed vaccine research. I will be sure you receive the research memo with our findings after they meet today.  In an  email exchange  on February 1, 2021, American Federation of Teachers (AFT) Senior Director of Health Issues,  Kelly Trautner  to CDC officials, White House officials, and AFT colleagues, Trautner thanks everyone for the “rich discussion about forthcoming CDC guidance:”  Thank you again for Friday’s rich discussion about forthcoming CDC guidance and for your openness to the suggestions made by our president, Randi Weingarten, and the AFT. We are hopeful that lines of communications will remain open, and that we can serve as a true thought partner as you continue the important work toward safe reopening of schools.  ***  We crafted the language below using a NIOSH (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health) document, as well as language in some of our agreements with school employers. Thank you for considering it  White House official Carole Johnson forwards Trautner’ s email to Walensky writing, “AFT followed up w suggested lang[uage] on accommodations per your exchange with Randi.”  On February 3, 2021, Walensky replied to CDC, HHS, White House, and AFT officials:  I just wanted to circle back and extend my gratitude for the language you have provided below. Regrets for my delay in reply but I wanted to be certain you knew it is being worked into (with just a few small tweaks) the school reopening guidance. We have also included the executive summary you suggested.  Please know that we are listening and working hard to ensure your confidence and partnership in this endeavor.  Within the “language” provided by Trautner to the White House officials, she suggested adding,  Employers should provide reassignment, remote work, or other options for staff who have documented high-risk conditions or who are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 to limit the risk of workplace exposure. Options for reassignment include telework, virtual teaching opportunities, modified job responsibilities, environmental modifications, scheduling flexibility, or temporary reassignment to different job responsibilities.  Trautner replied to Walensky:  Thank you so much for your responsiveness to the suggestions made by Randi and our team. We are immensely grateful for your genuine desire to earn our confidence and your commitment to partnership. We will pass this message along to Randi. She will certainly be most grateful.  On February 11, 2021, Trautner continued the exchange, emailing Walensky:  Thank you for your continued openness to our suggestions and input. We would like to share some thoughts regarding the paragraph below which was apparently leaked from the imminent guidance on reopening schools:  “At any level of community transmission, all schools can provide in-person instruction (either full or hybrid), through strict adherence to mitigation strategies. Recommended learning modes vary to minimize risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in school by emphasizing layered mitigation, including school policies requiring universal and correct mask use. The recommended learning modes (in-person, hybrid) depend on the level of community transmission and strict adherence to mitigation.”  It would be great to see the insertion some variation of the following: “In the event high-community transmission results from a new variant of SARS-CoV-2, a new update of these guidelines may be necessary.”  We are deeply concerned about likely implications this language will have in schools where strict adherence to mitigation strategies is lacking or is impossible to implement, particularly those schools in high-density, crumbling infrastructure areas, and particularly when community transmission is high. We don’t believe that any current research has demonstrated that all schools in those areas can safely reopen.  On March 17, 2021, Trautner  emailed  Walensky about a call from Weingarten, saying: “Randi is hoping to schedule a call with your folks about reopening issue, including maintaining mitigation protections and what might be needed in the context of higher vaccination numbers.”  On March 23, 2021, AFT President  Randi Weingarten  emailed  Secretary of Education  Miguel Cardona  and Walensky, saying that she had noted the “shift” in CDC’s guidance regarding physical distancing in schools with “keen interest.”  On March 20, 2021, the CDC issued new “  guidance  ” reducing suggested physical distancing from 6 feet to 3 feet for students.  Weingarten stated:  [A]lthough I was very worried about the implications of the shift, I reserved judgment until we could review the new studies that were presented….  ***  [W]e are not convinced that the evidence supports changing physical distancing requirements at this time. Our concern is that the cited studies do not identify the baseline mitigation strategies needed to support 3 feet of physical distancing.  ***  [W]e conclude that any shift from 6 feet to 3 feet must be accompanied by, at a minimum, universal and correct masking; effective ventilation; thorough cleaning of buildings; regular COVID-19 testing of teachers, staff and students; effective contact tracing and quarantine/isolation protocols; and the availability of vaccines to all people in schools who are eligible.  Weakening one layer of layered mitigation demands that the other layers must be strengthened. We strongly urge you, in any discussion of this shift, to forcefully insist on strict and strengthened adherence to the other mitigation strategies….  After months of mixed messaging and misinformation, consistency from our public health officials is a welcome change. But as educators with the expertise on how physical distancing works in schools, we have immediate logistical questions….  Weingarten added a list of questions regarding how school personnel can move about, whether simulcasting lessons was still necessary, and what the government’s mitigation strategies timeline was.  On April 9, 2021, Weingarten  emailed  Walensky about “Requesting Meeting about Variants,” stating: “On behalf of the AFT we would request a meeting with the CDC on the impact of the Covid variants, particularly what we are seeing in schools and communities.”  Walensky replied, “Dear Randi, Many thanks for reaching out. I’ll connect with my team and work to make this happen.”  What qualifies partisan teachers unions, other than generous contributions to  allied politicians  , to provide the CDC with public health guidance on reopening schools? The CDC is corrupted by politics and is dishonest when it suggests it is merely “following the science.”  Judicial Watch Seeks Evidence in Lawsuit against U.S. Capitol Police for January 6 Videos  Nancy Pelosi and her U.S. Capitol Police must have something to hide about January 6. Why else would they be hiding evidence from the American people?  Undeterred by their stonewalling, we filed a  motion for discovery  in our lawsuit against the United States Capitol Police (USCP) for videos and emails and videos concerning the disturbance at the U.S. Capitol on January 6 ( Judicial Watch v. United States Capitol Police (No. 1:21-cv-00401)).  Congress exempts itself from the Freedom of Information Act, we brought this case under the common law right of access to public records. The US Capitol Police declined to produce any records about the disturbance, however,  arguing  that the requested videos and other records are not “public records” and the public interest doesn’t warrant their release.  We asked the court to grant us the ability to gather evidence about the preservation and use of the infamous January 6 videos:  This case concerns whether the public has a right of access to records about what Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi has describe as “one of the darkest days in our nation’s history,” “an attack on our very democracy [,]” and “an attack on the peaceful transfer of power.” Speaker Pelosi also has stated, “It is imperative that we find the truth of that day and ensure that such an assault on our Capitol and Democracy cannot ever again happen.”  To find out the truth about what took place at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021 and to understand how Defendant United States Capitol Police and other government entities responded on that day, Plaintiff Judicial Watch requested access to certain communications and video recordings.  ***  (Judicial Watch) therefore moves for limited discovery to seek evidence to prove that the requested records are public records subject to the common law right of access and that the public’s interest in disclosure outweighs the government’s interest in keeping the records secret.  We  filed  the lawsuit for:  Email communications between the U.S. Capitol Police Executive Team and the Capitol Police Board concerning the security of the Capitol on January 6, 2021. The timeframe of this request is from January 1, 2021 through January 10, 2021.  Email communications of the Capitol Police Board with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. Department of Justice, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security concerning the security of the Capitol on January 6, 2021. The timeframe of this request is from January 1, 2021through January 10, 2021.  All video footage from within the Capitol between 12 pm and 9 pm on January 6, 2021  As the Pelosi House seeks the confidential phone and social media records of countless Americans concerning January 6, its U.S. Capitol Police is covering up 14,000 hours of video about what really happened that day. The U.S. Capitol Police should be required to explain under oath its reasons for refusing to turn over even one second of January 6 video to the American people.  U.S. Invests Millions to Bring Racial, Ethnic ‘Equity’ to STEM Education  You will be forgiven if you think operating a computer has nothing to do with race. And you would be wrong, at least according to the leftist-controlled National Science Foundation, which is pushing extremist and racist Critical Race Theory. Our Corruption Chronicles blog has  the story  .  Weeks after giving a private college hundreds of thousands of dollars to “identify any existence of systemic inequities” in science, technology, engineering, and math fields (STEM), the U.S. government is doling out nearly $2 million to address racial and gender disparities in high school computer education. The money will come from the National Science Foundation (NSF), which was created by Congress seven decades ago to promote the progress of science, advance national health and prosperity and secure the national defense. With an annual budget of $8.5 billion, the NSF funds more than a quarter of research conducted at American colleges and universities, where  theft of intellectual property  by Communist China is pervasive.  While the NSF is one of the government agencies that has long permitted Chinese Communist scientists to steal billions in taxpayer-funded research, it is also keeping up with the current climate of political correctness. A few days ago, the agency awarded two public universities a total of $1.9 million to “address the historical and current racial and gender disparities in participation in high school computer science education.” The project is part of a broader program called Researching Equity and Antiracist Learning in Computer Science (REAL-CS) that focuses on expanding participation for black, indigenous, “Latinx” (the new, politically correct gender-neutral term for Latino or Latina) and Pacific Islander students by addressing systemic barriers in high school computer science education. REAL-CS is designed to sustain another publicly-funded, “equity-focused” initiative called  Exploring Computer Science  (ECS) dedicated to “democratizing” the field by increasing opportunities for “traditionally underrepresented” high school students after a study identified disparities along “race and socioeconomic lines.”  The recent NSF allocations will go to the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) and the University of Oregon. UCLA, which has its own  CS Equity Project  , is getting  $1,026,000  from the NSF to help prepare teachers nationwide to reach thousands of minority high school students to take “an equity-focused CS course,” according to the grant announcement. The University of Oregon will receive  $873,999  to do the same. “Overall, the key goal of REAL-CS is to create the necessary conditions and capacity in high schools that lead to equitable participation of students of color in high-quality computer science classes,” according to the NSF. The agency assures the costly program will create systemic change by increasing the use of racially and culturally inclusive practices, refreshing existing curriculum and supplementary curricular materials with antiracist design tenets, and conducting deep qualitative research nationwide that investigates equity-oriented teacher beliefs and practices.  Weeks before awarding the UCLA and Oregon grants, the NSF gave a private liberal arts college in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania more than a quarter of a million dollars to uncover "
Fair Debt Collection Practices Act,What Is Fair Debt Collection Practices Act?,BlawgSearch | Bankruptcy,Justia,"What Is Fair Debt Collection Practices Act?

This law applies to all the debt collectors—law firms, businesses, and collection agencies—that collect or attempt to collect consumer debts. According to FDCPA, debt collectors cannot use any unfair or deceptive practices while collecting the debts.  What  Are the Debt Collection Practices That Are Prohibited Under FDCPA?  Debt collectors cannot:  Use  or threaten to use physical force.  Use  obscene or profane language.  Publish a list of names of consumers who refuse to pay their debts (except to a credit bureau).  Make  false, misleading, or deceptive statements.  Make threats of arrests or intimidation tactics.  What  if a debt collector violates the law ?  If you are contacted by a debt collector who is attempting to collect a debt on which you know you do not owe, or if a debt collector contacts you in violation of the FDCPA, you should contact a Fort Worth bankruptcy attorney immediately. The attorney will be able to review the case, determine whether there is a case against the debt collector, and if so, work to ensure that the debt collector follows the law in the future.  Consulting with a Fort Worth bankruptcy attorney can also put a halt to debt collection practices while you work out your debt obligations in a manner you can afford."

You need to … Continued The post FSAs, HSAs, HRAs: What employers need to understand appeared first on Business Management Daily.  You can blame the pandemic — employees are more attuned to health benefits, which means more employees may switch health plans or go into a health plan for the first time next year.  Almost all health plans offer add-on accounts — health flexible spending accounts, health savings accounts, or health reimbursement accounts. You need to know how these accounts differ so you can communicate about them to employees.  Here are the basics.  Health flexible spending accounts  Health flexible spending accounts (FSAs) are probably the most common add-on accounts. FSAs are primarily funded by employees through pretax deductions, although employers may make contributions. Most FSAs are offered through cafeteria plans.  Tax advantage: Employees’ and employers’ contributions are excluded from employees’ wages and aren’t subject to income or FICA taxes.  Eligibility: FSAs are generally available only to current employees.  Qualifying insurance: FSAs are generally offered alongside group health plans, but employees typically aren’t required to enroll in a group plan in order to enroll in the FSA. Employers may choose to limit FSA eligibility to only those employees enrolled in the group plan.  Contributions: Employees may make pre-tax contributions into their FSAs, but contributions are capped at $2,750 for 2021.  The total amount in employees’ FSA accounts must be made available to them at the start of the plan year, regardless of whether their contributions are withheld from their pay every pay period. Employees who don’t max out their accounts by the end of the plan year lose what’s left in their accounts (this is known as use-it-or-lose-it), unless FSAs specifically allow rollovers or grace periods.  Qualifying medical expenses: Qualified medical expenses include expenses for unreimbursed medical care under IRC § 213, general health products (like allergy pills), and menstrual care products incurred by employees and their spouses, dependents, and adult children younger than 27 at the end of the taxable year.  FSAs can’t be used to reimburse employees for their monthly premiums or for anything covered under another health plan.  Health reimbursement arrangements  Health reimbursement arrangements (HRAs), unlike FSAs and health savings accounts (see below), are funded solely by employers. There are five different types of HRAs.  Tax advantage: Employers’ contributions are excluded from employees’ wages and aren’t subject to income or FICA taxes.  Eligibility: HRAs are generally available to current and former employees.  Qualifying insurance: Generally, HRAs must either require covered employees to be simultaneously enrolled in a certain type of health plan or be provided in a more limited manner and offered alongside employee-sponsored insurance.  Contributions: In general, there are no statutory limits on HRA contributions. Employers set their maximum contributions when designing the plan. Some specific HRAs do have contribution caps, however.  Qualifying medical expenses: HRAs can be used for unreimbursed payments of qualifying medical expenses under IRC § 213 and menstrual care products incurred by employees and their spouses, employees’ dependents, and employees’ adult children younger than 27 at the end of the taxable year.  In some instances, employees may use HRAs to pay their monthly premiums.  Unused HRA balances at the end of the plan year may be carried forward, although employers may limit the amounts employees can carry over.  Health savings accounts  Health savings accounts (HSAs) must be paired with high-deductible health plans (HDHPs). Employees usually contribute to HSAs on a pretax basis. Employers can also make contributions to employees’ HSAs.  Tax advantage: Employee and employer contributions are excluded from employees’ wages and aren’t subject to income or FICA taxes. Unused HSA amounts may be invested, and earnings grow tax-free.  Eligibility: Employees can establish HSAs if their group coverage qualifies as HSA-eligible HDHPs, they don’t have disqualifying coverage and they can’t be claimed as dependents on another person’s tax return.  Qualifying insurance: HDHPs must meet certain cost-sharing requirements. For an HDHP to be HSA-qualified, the plan must:  Have a deductible above a certain threshold ($1,400 for single coverage and $2,800 for family coverage in 2022).  Limit out-of-pocket expenditures for covered benefits to an amount below a certain threshold ($7,050 for single coverage and $14,100 for family coverage in 2022).  Cover only preventive care and telehealth services before the deductible is met.  Contributions: Employees’ contributions are capped every year and subject to inflation adjustments by the IRS. For 2022, the maximum contributions are $3,650 for single employees and $7,300 for married employees.  Qualified medical expenses: Withdrawals from HSAs are tax-exempt if used for unreimbursed qualifying medical expenses for employees, employees’ spouses, and dependents.  Qualified medical expenses include all unreimbursed medical care under IRC § 213 and menstrual care products. Monthly premiums can’t be paid for with HSA funds."

Home Mortgage Disclosure Act,Opinion | It’s Time to Dismantle America’s Residential Caste System,POLITICO | Top Stories,POLITICO,"Opinion | It’s Time to Dismantle America’s Residential Caste System  America is starkly divided between neighborhoods that benefit from overinvestment and those that suffer from disinvestment. But identifying the geography of racial inequality also offers a mechanism for change.  The federal government also funnels about $10 billion annually through the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program for affordable housing construction. But it mostly results in construction in poor communities that already have more than their fair share of affordable housing. Nationally, only about 17 percent of LIHTC projects are built in high-opportunity neighborhoods with high-performing schools, low crime and easy access to jobs. That keeps those Americans who need affordable housing concentrated in the same low-opportunity areas.  Another program, HUD’s Housing Choice Vouchers, provides rental assistance to low-income tenants, but the program does not disrupt entrenched racial and economic segregation. Most Black and brown voucher holders land in low-opportunity areas, where more than 20 percent of residents are poor, while white voucher holders tend to find rentals in lower-poverty areas.  Thankfully, the Biden administration recently restored the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule that Trump tweeted about suspending. A few conservatives or libertarians criticize the AFFH rule for not pressuring localities to deregulate exclusionary zoning codes that insulate single-family housing from more dense residences such as apartments. But vocal opposition to inclusive housing can be found in both Republican and Democratic territory. In blue California, the state legislature failed to pass a critical bill that would have suspended local single-family zoning to help solve the state’s massive affordable housing crisis, though California recently passed legislation to force localities to open single-family 'hoods to duplexes.  While the vast majority of white Americans reject segregation in public opinion surveys, in practice their willingness to enter or remain in a neighborhood declines sharply as the percentage of Black neighbors increases, studies have found. The average white person lives in a neighborhood that is 76 percent white. Although most Black Americans no longer live in high-poverty Black neighborhoods, those 'hoods persist, as does the architecture of segregation. About half of all Black metropolitan residents live in highly segregated neighborhoods.  In a comprehensive study of neighborhood change between 1990 and 2010 in America’s 50 largest cities, geographer Elizabeth Delmelle found that neighborhoods of concentrated Black poverty remained the most persistent type, followed by those of concentrated white and Asian affluence. The boundaries of these neighborhoods at polar extremes hardened, while more moderate-income, multiethnic neighborhoods became more fragmented, showing more possibilities for racial and economic mixture.  Still, intentional segregation of Black people in the 20th century shaped development and living patterns for everyone and put in place an infrastructure for promoting and maintaining segregation that lives on. Racial steering by realtors who nudge homebuyers into segregated spaces, discrimination in mortgage lending, exclusionary zoning, a government-subsidized affordable housing industrial complex that concentrates poverty, local school boundaries that encourage segregation, plus continued resistance to integration by many but not all white Americans — all are forms of racial boundary maintenance today.  The segregation of affluence facilitates opportunity hoarding, whereby wealthy neighborhoods enjoy the best public services, environmental quality and private, public and natural amenities, while other communities are left with fewer, poorer-quality resources. Worse, suburban-favored quarters are subsidized by the people they exclude: Through income and other taxes, people of all racial and class backgrounds who live elsewhere help pay for the roads, sewers and other infrastructure that make these low-poverty, resource-rich places possible.  This pattern of overinvestment in exclusionary, predominantly white space and disinvestment or neglect elsewhere is replicated within cities across the country. In her book Segregation by Design, Jessica Trounstine amasses empirical evidence to support her theory that segregation creates a city politics that reproduces inequality — a racial hierarchy of favored and disfavored residents. After local governments deployed land use, slum clearance and other policies to tightly compact Black Americans beginning in the early 20th century, those residents also were denied adequate sewers, roads, garbage collection and public health services. Segregation institutionalized the preferences of white property owners, protecting their property values and giving them exclusive access to high-quality public amenities — a nefarious pattern that continues. Today, business elites bend local government to their will, ensuring that the luxury residential and commercial development they want gets built, regardless of competing community and housing needs.  In the first two decades of the new millennium, public and private investment rained down on favored parts of central cities. Black Americans, in contrast, continued to be denied. For example, a 2019 Urban Institute study found that majority-white neighborhoods in Chicago received about three times more public and private investment than majority-Black neighborhoods.  Neighborhoods on an upward trajectory, such as those in what’s known as the “White L” in Baltimore, were shaped in part by investors’ avoidance of Black and Latino people. In post-industrial cities that “revitalized” since 2000, areas targeted for development — usually downtown, near a university, a hospital or another key institution — became whiter. Yet in these same cities and era, Black neighborhoods, even some middle-class ones, often became poorer.  The city of Chicago demonstrates these stark divides all too well. Chicago’s largest and most populous neighborhood, Austin, is overwhelmingly Black. About 40 percent of its residents earn less than $25,000 annually. It was savaged by foreclosures after the financial crisis of the late 2000s, yet excluded from many of the city’s key neighborhood development programs.  I call the Black people trapped in high-poverty neighborhoods “descendants,” in recognition of an unbroken continuum from slavery. For descendants on the South and West sides of Chicago, watching booming downtown development while the city shuttered school after school in their neighborhoods added to the insult. Chicago had closed 70 public schools over eight years by 2012. Then, in 2013, Mayor Rahm Emanuel closed 50 additional public elementary schools — the largest one-time mass school closure in the country. The Great Cities Institute at the University of Illinois at Chicago found that schools with large numbers of Black students had a higher probability of closure than other schools with comparable test scores, locations and utilization rates.  As school infrastructure evaporated in Black 'hoods, the city invested in new options elsewhere. An investigative report by a local public radio station in 2016 revealed that new school building expansions after the 2013 closures were “overwhelmingly granted” to specialized schools that serve relatively low percentages of low-income and Black students.  Private actors also favor whiteness and disfavor Blackness. The Center for Investigative Reporting released a study in 2018 that analyzed 31 million records revealed by the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and found a disturbing pattern of denials by banks of Black and Latino applicants for traditional mortgages where white applicants with similar qualifications would be accepted. This modern-day redlining persisted in 61 metro areas, from Atlanta to Detroit, Philadelphia to San Antonio. The greater the number of Black or Latino people in a neighborhood, the more likely a loan application would be denied.  Borrowers from these neighborhoods are also more likely to be preyed on with subprime credit products. Large financial firms, backed by private equity investors, swarmed like vultures to pick through the carrion of the foreclosure crisis. They could purchase a foreclosed home at auction, say for $5,000, and sell it immediately with no repairs through a land contract for $30,000. The land contract is designed to produce failure by the buyer, who believes she is acquiring a home but in fact accumulates no equity unless and until the final installment is made. According to the National Consumer Law Center, Black and Latino people in marginal neighborhoods are disproportionately targeted for this plunder. Their dollars, earned through work we have come to acknowledge as “essential,” should gain them equity, but instead are transferred to financial titans.  Cities, too, engage in financial predation. A recent study by the Center for Municipal Finance found that cities are taxing owners of low-valued properties at higher rates than they should relative to actual land values, while taxing owners of high-valued properties at lower rates than they should.  Geography ultimately reifies power and opportunity for the few who live in rich neighborhoods and contributes to powerlessness and permanence of poverty for descendants.  Government does overinvest in Black neighborhoods in one area: punitive practices such as policing, law enforcement and incarceration. In many cities, Black people are disproportionately arrested for a range of offenses, including much non-violent behavior such as driving without a permit that under-policed whites can engage in with impunity.  What explains separate and unequal policing? George Floyd’s slow execution last year ushered a new national focus on racist policing. Less clear in that radical moment was the role of segregation. Floyd died in the racially mixed Powderhorn neighborhood of Minneapolis, due south of very poor Black neighborhoods on the south side and not far from a dividing line to affluent white space. Like every other segregated city, Minneapolis’ stark segregation was constructed with great intention. According to recent geographically mapped data published by the New York Times, since 2015 Minneapolis police used force against Black people at seven times the rate of whites. Police wielded guns, chemical irritants, Tasers, chokeholds, body-pins, fists and other brute force in the very Black 'hoods of the Northwest and the Southside of Minneapolis. The white working-class Northeast quadrant, across the Mississippi River from Black areas, were spared such intense use of force, as was the affluent white Southwest area.  Another function of anti-Black policing is economic plunder. In 2014 alone, New York City received nearly $32 million from fees, fines and surcharges paid to the criminal courts by people facing misdemeanors, summonses or other low-level violations. Researchers estimated that, over two decades, the city’s take from its “zero tolerance” policing exceeded a half billion dollars. They concluded that most of these revenues were “extracted from relatively poor segments of the population, who live in heavily policed neighborhoods.”  Although aggressive policing produces some revenues for local governments while harming Black citizens, it also produces liabilities that harm all taxpayers. A UCLA law professor looked at payouts by large cities to victims of police misconduct over five years and found they totaled nearly three-quarters of a trillion dollars. Perhaps the only beneficiaries of systemic anti-Black policing are owners and shareholders of corporations that profit from mass incarceration. In Chicago, there are 851 city blocks in which taxpayers spend more than $1 million per block to incarcerate residents who live there. Those blocks are concentrated on the West and South sides, in the 'hoods that Chicago built to contain descendants.  Children, too, are swept into the carceral state. As with segregated neighborhoods, segregated schools facilitate an entirely different relationship between police and young citizens. One legal scholar found that a school’s percentage of minority students and of poverty is a strong predictor of the use of strict security measures, even after controlling for actual levels of school crime and disorder. In New York City, 5,200 full-time police officers patrolled public schools as of 2017, while the schools employed only about 3,000 guidance counselors.  Then there are the ways in which the state encourages private surveillance of Black Americans by self-appointed citizen patrols. Barbecuing by a lake in Oakland. Entering one’s own gourmet lemonade business in San Francisco. A registered guest at a hotel in Portland, Oregon, taking a call from his mama in the lobby. A child mowing lawns for candy money in a Cleveland suburb. These and other acts of “living while Black” resulted in calls to the police. This is what living in white space can do to some people. Those used to being dominant, or unused to seeing dark bodies around, become suspicious of Black people doing utterly ordinary things.  As with slavery, as with Jim Crow, law and social practice continue to allow non-Blacks to monitor and police Black bodies. The worst of these social practices is violent vigilantism. Ahmaud Arbery. Trayvon Martin. Emmett Till. Arbery’s killers were charged and prosecuted. But the state of Georgia enabled their vigilante behavior through permissive laws that make it easy to obtain a gun and encourage, rather than discourage, using it. Georgia, like nearly three-quarters of U.S. states, has a “stand your ground” law that eliminates any duty to retreat and entitles gun owners to use force when they “reasonably believe” it is necessary to defend themselves or others.  Other laws quietly enable surveillance of Black folk to protect white space. An estimated 2,000 localities in 48 states have adopted “crime-free housing” or chronic nuisance ordinances that make landlords responsible for the actions or nonactions of their tenants. Such ordinances often are adopted following an influx of racial diversity. They explode the range of activities that can cause an eviction, and, according to law professor Deborah Archer, they are enforced disproportionately against Black tenants.  When a tenant tries to seek protection from the state, calling 911, say, to control a violent partner, in places with chronic nuisance ordinances, she can be evicted if she calls two or three times. Faribault, Minnesota, for example, adopted one of the harshest ordinances in the country. The ordinance prohibits disorderly conduct by tenants or their guests and gives Faribault police the power to order an eviction without an arrest or conviction of any crime.  Descendants cannot win. They are surveilled, overpoliced and under-protected.  Healing a nation that began with, and still suffers from, white supremacy requires abolition of the processes of residential caste and repair in poor Black neighborhoods. The state is obligated to repair what it put in motion and continues to reify.  But understanding and acknowledging the role of geographic lines in structuring racial inequality presents an opportunity — a targeted mechanism for transformation. My theory of repair is that those most traumatized by the processes of residential caste most deserve care, as well as the chance to be agents in their own liberation. That means government can and must prioritize those neighborhoods that are at the center of anti-Black residential caste in America.  To begin, the state should dismantle and reverse current anti-Black processes of residential caste — through investment in Black neighborhoods rather than, rather than redlining a"

But identifying the geography of racial inequality also offers a mechanism for change.  The federal government also funnels about $10 billion annually through the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program for affordable housing construction. But it mostly results in construction in poor communities that already have more than their fair share of affordable housing. Nationally, only about 17 percent of LIHTC projects are built in high-opportunity neighborhoods with high-performing schools, low crime and easy access to jobs. That keeps those Americans who need affordable housing concentrated in the same low-opportunity areas.  Another program, HUD’s Housing Choice Vouchers, provides rental assistance to low-income tenants, but the program does not disrupt entrenched racial and economic segregation. Most Black and brown voucher holders land in low-opportunity areas, where more than 20 percent of residents are poor, while white voucher holders tend to find rentals in lower-poverty areas.  Thankfully, the Biden administration recently restored the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule that Trump tweeted about suspending. A few conservatives or libertarians criticize the AFFH rule for not pressuring localities to deregulate exclusionary zoning codes that insulate single-family housing from more dense residences such as apartments. But vocal opposition to inclusive housing can be found in both Republican and Democratic territory. In blue California, the state legislature failed to pass a critical bill that would have suspended local single-family zoning to help solve the state’s massive affordable housing crisis, though California recently passed legislation to force localities to open single-family 'hoods to duplexes.

Home Mortgage Disclosure Act,It’s Time to Dismantle America’s Residential Caste System,POLITICO | Energy & Environment,POLITICO,"It’s Time to Dismantle America’s Residential Caste System  The federal government also funnels about $10 billion annually through the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program for affordable housing construction. But it mostly results in construction in poor communities that already have more than their fair share of affordable housing. Nationally, only about 17 percent of LIHTC projects are built in high-opportunity neighborhoods with high-performing schools, low crime and easy access to jobs. That keeps those Americans who need affordable housing concentrated in the same low-opportunity areas.  Another program, HUD’s Housing Choice Vouchers, provides rental assistance to low-income tenants, but the program does not disrupt entrenched racial and economic segregation. Most Black and brown voucher holders land in low-opportunity areas, where more than 20 percent of residents are poor, while white voucher holders tend to find rentals in lower-poverty areas.  Thankfully, the Biden administration recently restored the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule that Trump tweeted about suspending. A few conservatives or libertarians criticize the AFFH rule for not pressuring localities to deregulate exclusionary zoning codes that insulate single-family housing from more dense residences such as apartments. But vocal opposition to inclusive housing can be found in both Republican and Democratic territory. In blue California, the state legislature failed to pass a critical bill that would have suspended local single-family zoning to help solve the state’s massive affordable housing crisis, though California recently passed legislation to force localities to open single-family 'hoods to duplexes.  While the vast majority of white Americans reject segregation in public opinion surveys, in practice their willingness to enter or remain in a neighborhood declines sharply as the percentage of Black neighbors increases, studies have found. The average white person lives in a neighborhood that is 76 percent white. Although most Black Americans no longer live in high-poverty Black neighborhoods, those 'hoods persist, as does the architecture of segregation. About half of all Black metropolitan residents live in highly segregated neighborhoods.  In a comprehensive study of neighborhood change between 1990 and 2010 in America’s 50 largest cities, geographer Elizabeth Delmelle found that neighborhoods of concentrated Black poverty remained the most persistent type, followed by those of concentrated white and Asian affluence. The boundaries of these neighborhoods at polar extremes hardened, while more moderate-income, multiethnic neighborhoods became more fragmented, showing more possibilities for racial and economic mixture.  Still, intentional segregation of Black people in the 20th century shaped development and living patterns for everyone and put in place an infrastructure for promoting and maintaining segregation that lives on. Racial steering by realtors who nudge homebuyers into segregated spaces, discrimination in mortgage lending, exclusionary zoning, a government-subsidized affordable housing industrial complex that concentrates poverty, local school boundaries that encourage segregation, plus continued resistance to integration by many but not all white Americans — all are forms of racial boundary maintenance today.  The segregation of affluence facilitates opportunity hoarding, whereby wealthy neighborhoods enjoy the best public services, environmental quality and private, public and natural amenities, while other communities are left with fewer, poorer-quality resources. Worse, suburban-favored quarters are subsidized by the people they exclude: Through income and other taxes, people of all racial and class backgrounds who live elsewhere help pay for the roads, sewers and other infrastructure that make these low-poverty, resource-rich places possible.  This pattern of overinvestment in exclusionary, predominantly white space and disinvestment or neglect elsewhere is replicated within cities across the country. In her book Segregation by Design, Jessica Trounstine amasses empirical evidence to support her theory that segregation creates a city politics that reproduces inequality — a racial hierarchy of favored and disfavored residents. After local governments deployed land use, slum clearance and other policies to tightly compact Black Americans beginning in the early 20th century, those residents also were denied adequate sewers, roads, garbage collection and public health services. Segregation institutionalized the preferences of white property owners, protecting their property values and giving them exclusive access to high-quality public amenities — a nefarious pattern that continues. Today, business elites bend local government to their will, ensuring that the luxury residential and commercial development they want gets built, regardless of competing community and housing needs.  In the first two decades of the new millennium, public and private investment rained down on favored parts of central cities. Black Americans, in contrast, continued to be denied. For example, a 2019 Urban Institute study found that majority-white neighborhoods in Chicago received about three times more public and private investment than majority-Black neighborhoods.  Neighborhoods on an upward trajectory, such as those in what’s known as the “White L” in Baltimore, were shaped in part by investors’ avoidance of Black and Latino people. In post-industrial cities that “revitalized” since 2000, areas targeted for development — usually downtown, near a university, a hospital or another key institution — became whiter. Yet in these same cities and era, Black neighborhoods, even some middle-class ones, often became poorer.  The city of Chicago demonstrates these stark divides all too well. Chicago’s largest and most populous neighborhood, Austin, is overwhelmingly Black. About 40 percent of its residents earn less than $25,000 annually. It was savaged by foreclosures after the financial crisis of the late 2000s, yet excluded from many of the city’s key neighborhood development programs.  I call the Black people trapped in high-poverty neighborhoods “descendants,” in recognition of an unbroken continuum from slavery. For descendants on the South and West sides of Chicago, watching booming downtown development while the city shuttered school after school in their neighborhoods added to the insult. Chicago had closed 70 public schools over eight years by 2012. Then, in 2013, Mayor Rahm Emanuel closed 50 additional public elementary schools — the largest one-time mass school closure in the country. The Great Cities Institute at the University of Illinois at Chicago found that schools with large numbers of Black students had a higher probability of closure than other schools with comparable test scores, locations and utilization rates.  As school infrastructure evaporated in Black 'hoods, the city invested in new options elsewhere. An investigative report by a local public radio station in 2016 revealed that new school building expansions after the 2013 closures were “overwhelmingly granted” to specialized schools that serve relatively low percentages of low-income and Black students.  Private actors also favor whiteness and disfavor Blackness. The Center for Investigative Reporting released a study in 2018 that analyzed 31 million records revealed by the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and found a disturbing pattern of denials by banks of Black and Latino applicants for traditional mortgages where white applicants with similar qualifications would be accepted. This modern-day redlining persisted in 61 metro areas, from Atlanta to Detroit, Philadelphia to San Antonio. The greater the number of Black or Latino people in a neighborhood, the more likely a loan application would be denied.  Borrowers from these neighborhoods are also more likely to be preyed on with subprime credit products. Large financial firms, backed by private equity investors, swarmed like vultures to pick through the carrion of the foreclosure crisis. They could purchase a foreclosed home at auction, say for $5,000, and sell it immediately with no repairs through a land contract for $30,000. The land contract is designed to produce failure by the buyer, who believes she is acquiring a home but in fact accumulates no equity unless and until the final installment is made. According to the National Consumer Law Center, Black and Latino people in marginal neighborhoods are disproportionately targeted for this plunder. Their dollars, earned through work we have come to acknowledge as “essential,” should gain them equity, but instead are transferred to financial titans.  Cities, too, engage in financial predation. A recent study by the Center for Municipal Finance found that cities are taxing owners of low-valued properties at higher rates than they should relative to actual land values, while taxing owners of high-valued properties at lower rates than they should.  Geography ultimately reifies power and opportunity for the few who live in rich neighborhoods and contributes to powerlessness and permanence of poverty for descendants.  Government does overinvest in Black neighborhoods in one area: punitive practices such as policing, law enforcement and incarceration. In many cities, Black people are disproportionately arrested for a range of offenses, including much non-violent behavior such as driving without a permit that under-policed whites can engage in with impunity.  What explains separate and unequal policing? George Floyd’s slow execution last year ushered a new national focus on racist policing. Less clear in that radical moment was the role of segregation. Floyd died in the racially mixed Powderhorn neighborhood of Minneapolis, due south of very poor Black neighborhoods on the south side and not far from a dividing line to affluent white space. Like every other segregated city, Minneapolis’ stark segregation was constructed with great intention. According to recent geographically mapped data published by the New York Times, since 2015 Minneapolis police used force against Black people at seven times the rate of whites. Police wielded guns, chemical irritants, Tasers, chokeholds, body-pins, fists and other brute force in the very Black 'hoods of the Northwest and the Southside of Minneapolis. The white working-class Northeast quadrant, across the Mississippi River from Black areas, were spared such intense use of force, as was the affluent white Southwest area.  Another function of anti-Black policing is economic plunder. In 2014 alone, New York City received nearly $32 million from fees, fines and surcharges paid to the criminal courts by people facing misdemeanors, summonses or other low-level violations. Researchers estimated that, over two decades, the city’s take from its “zero tolerance” policing exceeded a half billion dollars. They concluded that most of these revenues were “extracted from relatively poor segments of the population, who live in heavily policed neighborhoods.”  Although aggressive policing produces some revenues for local governments while harming Black citizens, it also produces liabilities that harm all taxpayers. A UCLA law professor looked at payouts by large cities to victims of police misconduct over five years and found they totaled nearly three-quarters of a trillion dollars. Perhaps the only beneficiaries of systemic anti-Black policing are owners and shareholders of corporations that profit from mass incarceration. In Chicago, there are 851 city blocks in which taxpayers spend more than $1 million per block to incarcerate residents who live there. Those blocks are concentrated on the West and South sides, in the 'hoods that Chicago built to contain descendants.  Children, too, are swept into the carceral state. As with segregated neighborhoods, segregated schools facilitate an entirely different relationship between police and young citizens. One legal scholar found that a school’s percentage of minority students and of poverty is a strong predictor of the use of strict security measures, even after controlling for actual levels of school crime and disorder. In New York City, 5,200 full-time police officers patrolled public schools as of 2017, while the schools employed only about 3,000 guidance counselors.  Then there are the ways in which the state encourages private surveillance of Black Americans by self-appointed citizen patrols. Barbecuing by a lake in Oakland. Entering one’s own gourmet lemonade business in San Francisco. A registered guest at a hotel in Portland, Oregon, taking a call from his mama in the lobby. A child mowing lawns for candy money in a Cleveland suburb. These and other acts of “living while Black” resulted in calls to the police. This is what living in white space can do to some people. Those used to being dominant, or unused to seeing dark bodies around, become suspicious of Black people doing utterly ordinary things.  As with slavery, as with Jim Crow, law and social practice continue to allow non-Blacks to monitor and police Black bodies. The worst of these social practices is violent vigilantism. Ahmaud Arbery. Trayvon Martin. Emmett Till. Arbery’s killers were charged and prosecuted. But the state of Georgia enabled their vigilante behavior through permissive laws that make it easy to obtain a gun and encourage, rather than discourage, using it. Georgia, like nearly three-quarters of U.S. states, has a “stand your ground” law that eliminates any duty to retreat and entitles gun owners to use force when they “reasonably believe” it is necessary to defend themselves or others.  Other laws quietly enable surveillance of Black folk to protect white space. An estimated 2,000 localities in 48 states have adopted “crime-free housing” or chronic nuisance ordinances that make landlords responsible for the actions or nonactions of their tenants. Such ordinances often are adopted following an influx of racial diversity. They explode the range of activities that can cause an eviction, and, according to law professor Deborah Archer, they are enforced disproportionately against Black tenants.  When a tenant tries to seek protection from the state, calling 911, say, to control a violent partner, in places with chronic nuisance ordinances, she can be evicted if she calls two or three times. Faribault, Minnesota, for example, adopted one of the harshest ordinances in the country. The ordinance prohibits disorderly conduct by tenants or their guests and gives Faribault police the power to order an eviction without an arrest or conviction of any crime.  Descendants cannot win. They are surveilled, overpoliced and under-protected.  Healing a nation that began with, and still suffers from, white supremacy requires abolition of the processes of residential caste and repair in poor Black neighborhoods. The state is obligated to repair what it put in motion and continues to reify.  But understanding and acknowledging the role of geographic lines in structuring racial inequality presents an opportunity — a targeted mechanism for transformation. My theory of repair is that those most traumatized by the processes of residential caste most deserve care, as well as the chance to be agents in their own liberation. That means government can and must prioritize those neighborhoods that are at the center of anti-Black residential caste in America.  To begin, the state should dismantle and reverse current anti-Black processes of residential caste — through investment in Black neighborhoods rather than, rather than redlining and economic predation; inclusion, rather than boundary maintenance; equitable public funding, rather than overinvestment and hoarding for high-opportunity places; humanization and care, rather than surveillance and stereot"

The land contract is designed to produce failure by the buyer, who believes she is acquiring a home but in fact accumulates no equity unless and until the final installment is made. According to the National Consumer Law Center, Black and Latino people in marginal neighborhoods are disproportionately targeted for this plunder. Their dollars, earned through work we have come to acknowledge as “essential,” should gain them equity, but instead are transferred to financial titans.  Cities, too, engage in financial predation. A recent study by the Center for Municipal Finance found that cities are taxing owners of low-valued properties at higher rates than they should relative to actual land values, while taxing owners of high-valued properties at lower rates than they should.  Geography ultimately reifies power and opportunity for the few who live in rich neighborhoods and contributes to powerlessness and permanence of poverty for descendants.  Government does overinvest in Black neighborhoods in one area: punitive practices such as policing, law enforcement and incarceration. In many cities, Black people are disproportionately arrested for a range of offenses, including much non-violent behavior such as driving without a permit that under-policed whites can engage in with impunity.  What explains separate and unequal policing? George Floyd’s slow execution last year ushered a new national focus on racist policing. Less clear in that radical moment was the role of segregation. Floyd died in the racially mixed Powderhorn neighborhood of Minneapolis, due south of very poor Black neighborhoods on the south side and not far from a dividing line to affluent white space. Like every other segregated city, Minneapolis’ stark segregation was constructed with great intention. According to recent geographically mapped data published by the New York Times, since 2015 Minneapolis police used force against Black people at seven times the rate of whites. Police wielded guns, chemical irritants, Tasers, chokeholds, body-pins, fists and other brute force in the very Black 'hoods of the Northwest and the Southside of Minneapolis. The white working-class Northeast quadrant, across the Mississippi River from Black areas, were spared such intense use of force, as was the affluent white Southwest area.  Another function of anti-Black policing is economic plunder. In 2014 alone, New York City received nearly $32 million from fees, fines and surcharges paid to the criminal courts by people facing misdemeanors, summonses or other low-level violations. Researchers estimated that, over two decades, the city’s take from its “zero tolerance” policing exceeded a half billion dollars. They concluded that most of these revenues were “extracted from relatively poor segments of the population, who live in heavily policed neighborhoods.”  Although aggressive policing produces some revenues for local governments while harming Black citizens, it also produces liabilities that harm all taxpayers. A UCLA law professor looked at payouts by large cities to victims of police misconduct over five years and found they totaled nearly three-quarters of a trillion dollars. Perhaps the only beneficiaries of systemic anti-Black policing are owners and shareholders of corporations that profit from mass incarceration. In Chicago, there are 851 city blocks in which taxpayers spend more than $1 million per block to incarcerate residents who live there. Those blocks are concentrated on the West and South sides, in the 'hoods that Chicago built to contain descendants.  Children, too, are swept into the carceral state. As with segregated neighborhoods, segregated schools facilitate an entirely different relationship between police and young citizens. One legal scholar found that a school’s percentage of minority students and of poverty is a strong predictor of the use of strict security measures, even after controlling for actual levels of school crime and disorder. In New York City, 5,200 full-time police officers patrolled public schools as of 2017, while the schools employed only about 3,000 guidance counselors.  Then there are the ways in which the state encourages private surveillance of Black Americans by self-appointed citizen patrols. Barbecuing by a lake in Oakland. Entering one’s own gourmet lemonade business in San Francisco. A registered guest at a hotel in Portland, Oregon, taking a call from his mama in the lobby. A child mowing lawns for candy money in a Cleveland suburb. These and other acts of “living while Black” resulted in calls to the police. This is what living in white space can do to some people. Those used to being dominant, or unused to seeing dark bodies around, become suspicious of Black people doing utterly ordinary things.  As with slavery, as with Jim Crow, law and social practice continue to allow non-Blacks to monitor and police Black bodies. The worst of these social practices is violent vigilantism. Ahmaud Arbery. Trayvon Martin. Emmett Till. Arbery’s killers were charged and prosecuted. But the state of Georgia enabled their vigilante behavior through permissive laws that make it easy to obtain a gun and encourage, rather than discourage, using it. Georgia, like nearly three-quarters of U.S. states, has a “stand your ground” law that eliminates any duty to retreat and entitles gun owners to use force when they “reasonably believe” it is necessary to defend themselves or others.  Other laws quietly enable surveillance of Black folk to protect white space. An estimated 2,000 localities in 48 states have adopted “crime-free housing” or chronic nuisance ordinances that make landlords responsible for the actions or nonactions of their tenants. Such ordinances often are adopted following an influx of racial diversity. They explode the range of activities that can cause an eviction, and, according to law professor Deborah Archer, they are enforced disproportionately against Black tenants.  When a tenant tries to seek protection from the state, calling 911, say, to control a violent partner, in places with chronic nuisance ordinances, she can be evicted if she calls two or three times. Faribault, Minnesota, for example, adopted one of the harshest ordinances in the country. The ordinance prohibits disorderly conduct by tenants or their guests and gives Faribault police the power to order an eviction without an arrest or conviction of any crime.  Descendants cannot win. They are surveilled, overpoliced and under-protected.  Healing a nation that began with, and still suffers from, white supremacy requires abolition of the processes of residential caste and repair in poor Black neighborhoods. The state is obligated to repair what it put in motion and continues to reify.  But understanding and acknowledging the role of geographic lines in structuring racial inequality presents an opportunity — a targeted mechanism for transformation. My theory of repair is that those most traumatized by the processes of residential caste most deserve care, as well as the chance to be agents in their own liberation. That means government can and must prioritize those neighborhoods that are at the center of anti-Black residential caste in America.  To begin, the state should dismantle and reverse current anti-Black processes of residential caste — through investment in Black neighborhoods rather than, rather than redlining a"
European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority,EIOPA publishes the criteria for the independence of supervisory authorities,European Union Newsroom | European Court of Justice Press Releases,Europa.eu (European Union),"EIOPA publishes the criteria for the independence of supervisory authorities  The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) published today its criteria for assessing the independence of supervisory authorities.  The independence of supervisory authorities is crucial for the legitimacy and credibility of the supervisory process. For public bodies, independence and good governance are necessary to avoid possible conflicts of interest and to reduce the likelihood of undue external influence on supervisory decisions.  The criteria provide clarity for supervisory authorities on EIOPA’s expectations. Taking on board the relevant articles in the Solvency II and IORP II Directive, international standards and supervisory experiences, they specify further the principles of operational, financial and personal independence as well as transparency and accountability.  As a next step, EIOPA plans to assess supervisory authorities’ independence, for example with the use of dedicated peer reviews. By doing this, EIOPA aims to ensure the consistent application of legislation, to preserve financial stability and to protect consumers.  Download the paper  Background  Following the review of the European Supervisory Authorities and the revision of the EIOPA regulation, EIOPA has an obligation to foster and monitor supervisory independence of national competent authorities (NCAs). The EIOPA regulation sets out that peer reviews shall be used as a tool for the assessment of the degree of independence and governance arrangements of NCAs.  In line with the Article 81 of the EIOPA regulation, EIOPA will also publish a report that will take stock of the situation on independence of national supervisory authorities along key aspects i.e. operational independence, financial independence, personal independence as well as accountability and transparency."

(3) According to data from the American Community Survey, which has replaced the decennial census for detailed socioeconomic information about United States residents, approximately 15.2 million Californians speak a language other than English at home, based on data from combined years 2009 through 2011. This compares to approximately 19.6 million people who speak only English at home. Among the Californians who speak a language other than English at home, approximately 8.4 million speak English very well, and another 3 million speak English well. The remaining 3.8 million Californians surveyed do not speak English well or do not speak English at all. Among this group, the five languages other than English that are most widely spoken at home are Spanish, Chinese, Tagalog, Vietnamese, and Korean. These five languages are spoken at home by approximately 3.5 million of the 3.8 million Californians with limited or no English proficiency, who speak a language other than English at home.  (b) Any person engaged in a trade or business who negotiates primarily in Spanish, Chinese, Tagalog, Vietnamese, or Korean, orally or in writing, in the course of entering into any of the following, shall deliver to the other party to the contract or agreement, and any other person who will be signing the contract or agreement, and before the execution thereof, a translation of the contract or agreement in the language in which the contract or agreement was negotiated, that which includes a translation of every term and condition in that contract or agreement:  (1) A contract or agreement subject to the provisions of Title 2 (commencing with Section 1801) of, and Chapter 2b (commencing with Section 2981) and Chapter 2d (commencing with Section 2985.7) of Title 14 of, Part 4 of Division 3.

(g) The term “contract” or “agreement,” as used in this section, means the document creating the rights and obligations of the parties and includes any subsequent document making substantial changes in the rights and obligations of the parties. The term “contract” or “agreement” does not include any subsequent documents authorized or contemplated by the original document such as periodic statements, sales slips or invoices representing purchases made pursuant to a credit card agreement, a retail installment contract or account or other revolving sales or loan account, memoranda of purchases in an add-on sale, or refinancing of a purchase as provided by, or pursuant to, the original document.  The term “contract” or “agreement” does not include a home improvement contract as defined in Sections 7151.2 and 7159 of the Business and Professions Code, nor does it include plans, specifications, description of work to be done and materials to be used, or collateral security taken or to be taken for the retail buyer’s obligation contained in a contract for the installation of goods by a contractor licensed pursuant to Chapter 9 (commencing with Section 7000) of Division 3 of the Business and Professions Code, if the home improvement contract or installation contract is otherwise a part of a contract described in subdivision (b).  Matters ordinarily incorporated by reference in contracts or agreements as described in paragraph (3) of subdivision (b), including, but not limited to, rules and regulations governing a tenancy and inventories of furnishings to be provided by the person described in subdivision (b), are not included in the term “contract” or “agreement.”  (h) (1) This section does not apply to any person engaged in a trade or business who negotiates primarily in a language other than English, as described in subdivision (b), if the party with whom that person is negotiating is a buyer of goods or services, or receives a loan or extension of credit, or enters an agreement obligating that party as a tenant, lessee, or sublessee, or similarly obligates the party by contract or lease, and the party negotiates the terms of the contract, lease, or other obligation through the party’s own interpreter.  (2) As used in this subdivision, “the party’s own interpreter” means a person who is not a minor and who is able to speak fluently and read with full understanding both the English language and any of the languages specified in subdivision (b) in which the contract, lease, or other obligation was negotiated, and who is not employed by, or whose service is not made available through, the person engaged in the trade or business.  (i) (1) If a person engaged in a trade or business knows or has reason to know that a person who will sign a contract but will not receive the goods, services, money, or other subject of the contract is not proficient in English, the person engaged in a trade or business shall deliver to that person, before the execution of, and on a separate page immediately preceding the contract or agreement, a document containing the following notice in the languages described in subdivision (b):  “You are being asked to guarantee this debt. Think carefully before you do. If the borrower does not pay the debt, you will have to pay the debt. Be sure that you can afford to pay if you have to, and that you want to accept this responsibility.  You may have to pay up to the full amount of the debt if the borrower does not pay. You may also have to pay late fees or collection costs, which increase this amount.  The creditor can collect this debt from you without first trying to collect from the borrower. The creditor can use the same collection methods against you that can be used against the borrower, such as suing you, garnishing your wages, etc. If this debt is ever in default, that fact may become part of your credit record.  This notice is not the contract that makes you liable for the debt.”  (2) On January 1, 2022, the Business, Consumer Services, and Housing Agency Department of Financial Protection and Innovation shall make available for download on its internet website translations of the notice described in paragraph (1), which may be used by any person engaged in a trade or business to satisfy the requirements of this section.

It is permissible, but not required, that this translation be signed.  (k) The terms of the contract or agreement that is executed in the English language shall determine the rights and obligations of the parties. However, the translation of the contract or the disclosures required by subdivision (e) in any of the languages specified in subdivision (b) in which the contract or agreement was negotiated shall be admissible in evidence only to show that no contract was entered into because of a substantial difference in the material terms and conditions of the contract and the translation.  (l) Upon a failure to comply with the provisions of this section, the person aggrieved may rescind the contract or agreement in the manner provided by this chapter. If the contract for a consumer credit sale or consumer lease that has been sold and assigned to a financial institution is rescinded pursuant to this subdivision, the consumer shall make restitution to and have restitution made by the person with whom the consumer made the contract and shall give notice of rescission to the assignee. Notwithstanding that the contract was assigned without recourse, the assignment shall be deemed rescinded, and the assignor shall promptly repurchase the contract from the assignee."

The [REDACTED] of our Company will constitute a spin-off from Toridoll Japan and a  separate [REDACTED] of our Group’s business on the Main Board of the Stock Exchange.  During the Track Record Period, both TamJai brand and SamGor brand experienced growth in  revenue, which was mainly attributable to the expansion of our restaurant network despite the social  movements in Hong Kong in the second half of 2019 and the outbreak of COVID-19 in early 2020.  For the year ended 31 March 2020, our average daily revenue per restaurant for TamJai brand  decreased, mainly driven by the decrease in customer traffic as a result of the social movements in  certain districts in Hong Kong in the second halfof2019andtheoutbreakofCOVID-19inearly  2020, partially offset by additional revenue from the increase in menu price during the year; while  our average daily revenue per restaurant for SamGor brand increased, mainly attributable to the  additional revenue from the increase in menu price during the year, partially offset by the impact of  social movements and the outbreak of COVID-19. As compared to TamJai brand, SamGor brand  was less affected by the social movements and achieved better performance for the year ended 31  March 2020, primarily because our SamGor restaurants were located further away from the core  areas of the social movements.  For the year ended 31 March 2021, the average spending per customer of TamJai brand  decreased slightly, which was primarily due to (i) the offering of value snacks/drinks and mixian  combo for takeaway orders and snacks giveaway to our customers during the year, which had led to  the decrease in snacks and drinks ordered at regular price during the same year; partially offset by  (ii) the increase in delivery orders which the menu price at online delivery platform was generally  higher than that at our physical restaurants; during the same year, the average spending per  customer of SamGor brand increased, which was primarily due to the increase in delivery orders and  the launch of time limit premium mixian options. The delivery of SamGor brand increased more  prominently than TamJai brand, which we believe was primarily due to the marketing support and  popularity of the delivery platform used by SamGor during the year.  Please see the section headed ‘‘Business — Our restaurants — Operating performance of our  restaurants’’ in this document for details.  The following table sets the details of our comparable restaurant  (Note)  revenue during the  TrackRecordPeriod:  consumables and packaging expenses primarily as a result of the increased takeaway and delivery  orders; and (iii) the increase in depreciation expenses associated with the expansion of our restaurant  network.  During the Track Record Period and up to the Latest Practicable Date, we had complied with  the relevant regulations and measures implemented by the government authorities in relation to the  COVID-19 pandemic in all material respects, save for five incidents as set out in the section headed  ‘‘Business — The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic’’ in this document.  for the four months ended 31 July 2020, reaching 95.5% of that for the four months ended 31 July  2019. Based on the above, our Directors are of the view that our performance has recovered to  substantially the same level as or better than the level before the social movement in the second half  of 2019 and the outbreak of the COVID-19 in early 2020.  During the period from July 2020 to June 2021, we temporarily suspended dine-in, takeaway  and/or delivery service of a total of 54 restaurants for approximately five days on average for  sterilisation and/or quarantine primarily because our employees, their close contacts or certain  customers were infected with COVID-19. As at the Latest Practicable Date, all of the affected  restaurants had resumed normal operation.  During the Track Record Period and up to the Latest Practicable Date, we had not experienced  any material shortage, delay or interruption in relation to the supply of food ingredients or other raw  materials from our suppliers that materially and adversely affected our operation and financial  condition.  For further details, please refer to the section headed ‘‘Business — The impact of the  COVID-19 pandemic’’ in this document.  brands will allow us to capitalise on the strong brand recognition of each brand and achieve a higher  market share than we would have achieved if we hadmergedthetwobrandsordiscontinuedthe  operation of either brand.  The target customers of TamJai and SamGor include all walks of life with a focus on teenagers  and young to middle-aged adults. Both TamJai and Samgor are positioned as fast casual restaurants  aimed at providing quality food and quick services at competitive prices. We carefully select different  ingredients and spices in preparing the soup bases of TamJai and SamGor so as to create different  tastes for the two brands. Each brand has its own exclusive featured combinations of mixian and  toppings,soupbases,snacksandspecialdrinks.Further, the restaurants under the two brands are  designed differently. Each brand has adopted a distinct colour scheme for its restaurant setting and  environment and has built up its own brand image. For further details, please refer to the section  headed ‘‘Business — Our restaurants — Our brands’’ in this document.  During the Track Record Period, our customers were primarily retail customers from the  general public. Our Directors consider that it is not practicable to identify our five largest customers  during the Track Record Period due to the diverse nature of our customer base.

European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority,EIOPA publishes the criteria for the independence of supervisory authorities,European Union Newsroom | Home,Europa.eu (European Union),"EIOPA publishes the criteria for the independence of supervisory authorities  The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) published today its criteria for assessing the independence of supervisory authorities.  The independence of supervisory authorities is crucial for the legitimacy and credibility of the supervisory process. For public bodies, independence and good governance are necessary to avoid possible conflicts of interest and to reduce the likelihood of undue external influence on supervisory decisions.  The criteria provide clarity for supervisory authorities on EIOPA’s expectations. Taking on board the relevant articles in the Solvency II and IORP II Directive, international standards and supervisory experiences, they specify further the principles of operational, financial and personal independence as well as transparency and accountability.  As a next step, EIOPA plans to assess supervisory authorities’ independence, for example with the use of dedicated peer reviews. By doing this, EIOPA aims to ensure the consistent application of legislation, to preserve financial stability and to protect consumers.  Download the paper  Background  Following the review of the European Supervisory Authorities and the revision of the EIOPA regulation, EIOPA has an obligation to foster and monitor supervisory independence of national competent authorities (NCAs). The EIOPA regulation sets out that peer reviews shall be used as a tool for the assessment of the degree of independence and governance arrangements of NCAs.  In line with the Article 81 of the EIOPA regulation, EIOPA will also publish a report that will take stock of the situation on independence of national supervisory authorities along key aspects i.e. operational independence, financial independence, personal independence as well as accountability and transparency."

HIPAA - Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act,Who is covered by Biden's new vaccine mandates and when do they go into effect? Here's what we know.,Yahoo! News | Business,Yahoo! News,"Who is covered by Biden's new vaccine mandates and when do they go into effect? Here's what we know.  Joey Garrison, Courtney Subramanian, Rick Rouan and Mabinty Quarshie, USA TODAY  In this article:   Something went wrong.  Please try again later.  More content below  46th and current president of the United States  WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden took  in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic Thursday, ordering employers with 100 or more workers to ensure their workforce is entirely vaccinated or face weekly COVID testing.  In an address to the nation in which he outlined a six-part plan, Biden said his administration also ordered that all federal employees and employees of government contractors must be vaccinated.  Many GOP governors have come out in opposition to Biden's orders and said they .  Here's what we know about the president's new plan to help fight the pandemic.  What did the Biden administration order and is vaccine mandate unconstitutional?  Biden said the Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration would issue an “emergency temporary standard” that mandates employers with 100 or more workers require the vaccine or conduct weekly testing of unvaccinated employees.  The administration is also requiring employers with more than 100 employees to provide paid time off to allow workers to get vaccinated or recover if they are ill after the shot.  OSHA has the power to issue those standards until a permanent standard is developed when “workers are in grave danger” from exposure to toxic substances or agents or to new hazards, .  For example, in June,  requiring health care employers to provide N95 masks and other personal protective equipment to some employees and ensure social distancing. The orders are subject to challenge in the U.S. Court of Appeals.  More:  Who does the vaccine mandate cover?  The vaccine mandate covers all private employers with more than 100 employees, meaning it will generally apply to corporations and other large businesses. In all, more than 80 million workers are affected.  If workers choose not to be vaccinated, they would have to pass a weekly COVID-19 test to come to work.  Biden singled out some companies that already have vaccination requirements: United Airlines, , Tyson Foods and “even Fox News.”  More:  Who does it not cover?  Smaller private businesses with fewer than 100 people are not included in the mandate. However, Biden issued vaccination mandates for other workers as well. They include most federal government workers, all 17 million workers at nursing home facilities and hospitals that receive Medicare and Medicaid funds and staff of federal Head Start and Early Head Start programs.  In all, Biden said the mandates cover about 100 million Americans, or two-thirds of the U.S. workforce.  Biden also called for COVID-19- vaccines to be required to attend sports arenas, large concert halls and other venues where large groups of people gather. Yet he did not single out .  Who counts as a federal worker?  The vaccine order for the federal government requires all federal executive branch workers to be vaccinated as well as all employees of federal contractors.  It covers about 90% of approximately 4 million federal workers but does not apply to non-executive branch employees such as members of Congress or judicial employees.  In addition, the order covers federal departments and agencies that have already started to implement vaccination mandates:  under the Department of Defense, , the Indian Health Service, and the National Institutes of Health.  Previously,  federal employees show they have been vaccinated or undergo regular testing.  When will vaccine mandate start?  It was unclear on Thursday when exactly the requirements would take effect. OSHA is expected to issue the rule ""in the coming weeks,"" according to the White House, and implementation could follow a timeline similar to those in the public and private sectors. In some cases, those have ranged from weeks to months.  The exact timeframe will be dependent on the rulemaking process.  What about HIPAA? How can employers ask for this?  The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, know as HIPAA, prevents health care professionals from sharing private health information . It does not apply to those outside of a health care setting, such as businesses and individuals, asking questions about a person’s vaccine status, experts say.  The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission previously  that allow employers to require on-site employees be vaccinated, provided they don't violate civil rights and disability laws. In July, the Department of Justice  that federal law does not prohibit federal agencies or private businesses from mandating vaccines.  What are the punishments for businesses that don’t comply?  Businesses that do not comply with Biden’s directive will face “substantial fines” up to $14,000, according to a senior administration official. The Labor Department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration will enforce the fine.  This article originally appeared on USA TODAY:"
Investment Advisers Act of 1940,New US Digital Assets Bill Casts Wide Net,JD Supra Consumer Protection,JD Supra,"New US Digital Assets Bill Casts Wide Net  An ambitious proposal could bring digital assets into the mainstream regulatory fold. During an eventful summer for the digital assets industry, it may have been easy to miss US Representative Don Beyer’s introduction of the Digital Asset Market Structure and Investor Protection Act (the Bill) on July 28, 2021.... By: Latham & Watkins LLP  An ambitious proposal could bring digital assets into the mainstream regulatory fold.  During an eventful summer for the digital assets industry, it may have been easy to miss US Representative Don Beyer’s introduction of the Digital Asset Market Structure and Investor Protection Act (the Bill) on July 28, 2021. The Bill is perhaps the most promising effort to date by Congress to enact legislation that would address some of the legal ambiguities for digital assets and better define their place within existing financial regulatory structures.  Rep. Beyer described the current legal landscape for digital assets as “ambiguous and dangerous for investors and consumers.” Broadly, the Bill seeks to address deficiencies and/or ambiguities relating to consumer protection, trade reporting and transparency, and anti-money laundering / know your client (AML/KYC) procedures for digital assets.  The Bill also seeks to address a wide range of practical issues, from the fundamental (such as defining industry terms and categorizing cryptoassets) to the more nuanced (such as establishing standards for transaction reporting and consumer protection and advisories).  Security, Commodity, Other  The Bill would categorize digital assets as either “Digital Assets” or “Digital Asset Securities.” This categorization would then determine regulatory consequences and the allocation of agency regulatory jurisdiction.  The Bill would define a Digital Asset Security (in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Securities Act of 1933, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the Investment Company Act of 1940, and the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970) as a Digital Asset that provides the holder of such asset with any of the following:  Equity or debt interest in the issuer  The right to profits, interest, or dividend payments from the issuer  Voting rights in the major corporate actions of the issuer (which shall not include new block creations, hard forks, or protocol changes related to the digital asset)  Liquidation rights in the event of the issuer’s liquidation  The Digital Asset Security definition would also include any Digital Asset issued by an issuer with a service, goods, or platform that is not wholly operational at the time of issuance where such Digital Asset is transferred to the holder for payment, in order to fund the development of the proposed service, goods, or platform.  The Bill would also amend the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) to incorporate a broad definition of a Digital Asset as an asset that, among other things, is created electronically or digitally through software code and has a transaction history that is recorded on a distributed ledger or other “digital data structure in which consensus is achieved through a mathematically verifiable process.”  Joint Rulemaking on Digital Asset Classification  The Bill would mandate that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) issue a joint rulemaking no later than 270 days after the Bill’s enactment that categorizes each of the top 25 digital assets by market capitalization and also by daily trading volume under the bifurcated categorization discussed above.  SEC Oversight  Under the Bill, any Digital Asset that met the definition of a Digital Asset Security would be deemed to be, and regulated as, a security under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  The Bill would allow for a grace period before registering a Digital Asset Security with the SEC became necessary, akin to the Exchange Act’s treatment of issuers that are banks, savings and loan holding companies, and bank holding companies. An issuer of Digital Assets would be required to register a Digital Asset Security with the SEC:  No later than 120 days after the last day of the third fiscal year on which the issuer first has total assets exceeding US$10 million and a class of equity security (other than an exempted security) held of record by 2,000 or more persons  The Bill would also allow for the “desecuritization” of a Digital Asset Security at any time after it is registered as a security with the SEC. An asset’s status as a security could be terminated at the SEC’s discretion (and thereby rendered a commodity) if:  The issuer files a desecuritization certification with the SEC demonstrating that the issuer’s service, goods, or platform are fully operational and that the Digital Asset does not provide its holders with any of the rights that the Bill enumerates in the definition of a Digital Asset Security  This provision allowing for the desecuritization of a digital asset at a later date contrasts starkly with SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce’s Token Safe Harbor Proposal 2.0, which would provide a time-limited exemption at the outset for token-based projects that seek to raise capital to develop decentralized networks (see this Latham blog post for more information).  CFTC Oversight  The Bill would amend the CEA definition of a “commodity” to expressly include ‘‘digital assets (including Bitcoin, Ether, and their hardforks),” thereby providing statutory confirmation of the current market understanding that has emerged through SEC and CFTC enforcement and informal guidance.  The Bill would extend the definitions of certain CFTC-regulated intermediary activities — namely, those of futures commission merchants and introducing brokers — to include engaging in the relevant intermediation activities with respect to “any contract of sale of a digital asset in interstate commerce, but not a digital asset security.” As these intermediary definitions currently apply only in relation to commodity interest transactions (i.e., commodity futures, options, or swaps) and retail commodity transactions regulated as futures under Section 2(c)(2)(D) of the CEA, this would subject spot digital asset market participants to CFTC registration and regulation.  With respect to retail leveraged, margined, or financed transactions in commodities, the Bill would shorten the requirements for the “actual delivery” exception to Section 2(c)(2)(D) of the CEA with respect to Digital Assets to require delivery within 24 hours after the transaction is entered into, rather than 28 days (see this Latham blog post for more information). In doing so, the Bill would identify “actual delivery” of a Digital Asset to have taken place by reference to the time the relevant transaction is (i) recorded on the public distributed ledger for the Digital Asset; or (ii) with respect to Digital Asset transactions that are not recorded on a public distributed ledger for the Digital Asset, reported to a CFTC-registered “digital asset trade repository.” The Bill would introduce digital asset trade repositories as a new category of CFTC-registered entities subject to similar regulatory requirements as are applicable to swap data repositories.  The Bill would also amend the CEA to provide for an “optional federal charter” allowing for Digital Asset trading and clearing through existing CFTC-registered entities. In this regard, the Bill would provide the CFTC with exclusive jurisdiction over any agreement, contract, or transaction involving a contract of sale of a commodity in interstate commerce (including any Digital Asset) that is listed, traded, or cleared on or through a registered entity (e.g., a designated contract market or derivatives clearing organization). The Bill would provide that such contracts shall be treated for regulatory and enforcement purposes as if they were contracts of sale of a commodity for future delivery.  Stablecoins  The Bill would provide that, from the date of enactment, no person may issue, use, or permit to be used a Digital Asset fiat-based stablecoin that is not approved by the Secretary of the Treasury. The Secretary of the Treasury would be required within 90 days of the Bill’s enactment to establish a stablecoin application process through which the Secretary may approve or disapprove a person wishing to issue a Digital Asset fiat-based stablecoin. Importantly, the Bill would not grandfather existing stablecoins, and so would require an application for stablecoins in existence at the time of the Bill’s enactment.  Central Bank Digital Currency  To remove any uncertainty as to the Federal Reserve’s legal authority to issue a US central bank digital currency (CBDC), the Bill would authorize the Federal Reserve to issue “Digital Federal Reserve Notes” with legal tender status. Foreign fiat currencies, Digital Assets, and Digital Asset Securities would be expressly denied legal tender status, which could hamper digital asset proponents calls to move digital assets into the realm of legal tender (see this Latham blog post on the implications of El Salvador’s designation of Bitcoin as legal tender).  Bank Secrecy Act  The Bill would add Digital Assets and Digital Asset Securities to the Bank Secrecy Act’s (BSA’s) statutory definition of “monetary instruments,” thus subjecting them to the BSA’s AML and reporting requirements.  The Bill proposes to amend the BSA to define a “virtual asset service provider” (VASP) in such a manner as to exclude “any person who obtains a digital asset to purchase goods or services for themself; provides communication service or network access services used by a money transmitter; or develops, creates, or disseminates software designed to be used to issue a digital asset or facilitate financial activities associated with a digital asset.”  Financial Crimes Enforcement Network  The Bill would require the Secretary of the Treasury, acting through the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), to issue rules within 180 days of the Bill’s enactment that govern Digital Asset anonymizing services, money mules, and anonymity-enhanced convertible virtual currency transactions that are used to prevent association of an individual customer with the movement of a Digital Asset or Digital Asset Security.  Under the Bill, VASPs that are engaged in services that are available in the US and to US persons would be required to register with the SEC or the CFTC, as appropriate, even if the VASP were located outside the US. With respect to Digital Asset Securities, the Bill would require VASPs to meet the customer protection and account custody rules that are applicable to SEC-registered broker-dealers for customer funds and securities. With respect to Digital Assets, the Bill would require VASPs to meet the customer account custody and segregated funds rules that are applicable to CFTC-registered futures commission merchants.  The Bill would also require a joint report by the SEC, the CFTC, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and the Secretary of the Treasury, within 270 days of enactment “provid[ing] recommendations on the regulation, licensing, and auditing of digital asset custodians and digital asset security custodians.”  Decentralized Finance  While the Bill does not substantively address decentralized finance (DeFi), it would require a joint report by the Federal Reserve Board (FRB), the SEC, the CFTC, the OCC, and the Secretary of the Treasury within 270 days of enactment that (i) summarizes the current state and use of DeFi in the US, (ii) discusses whether DeFi poses any financial stability risks, and (iii) “provide[s] recommendations regarding appropriate regulation and investor protection for decentralized finance in US banking, securities, and commodities, including with respect to US jurisdiction and application of US law.”  Consumer Protection  Within 90 days of enactment, the Bill would require the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) to publish on their respective websites a notice regarding the treatment of Digital Assets and Digital Asset Securities and stating that Digital Assets and Digital Asset Securities are not “deposits” or “shares” covered by federal deposit insurance (regardless of whether an insured bank, savings association, or credit union holds the Digital Asset or Digital Asset Security). The Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) would also be required to publish a notice on its website regarding the status of Digital Assets and Digital Asset Securities and stating that Digital Assets are not deposits and Digital Asset Securities are (in almost all cases) not securities, and thus neither would be covered by SIPC insurance.  Conclusion  The digital asset industry presents novel problems that are not easy to resolve under current US law. Rep. Beyer noted in a public statement that “[o]ur laws are behind the times, and my bill would start the long overdue process of updating them to give digital asset holders and investors basic protections.” Legislative solutions would be welcome, and would help avoid the development of a fragmented and burdensome regulatory environment. Top regulators themselves have remarked on the necessity for legislative guidance, including SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who noted in a recent speech that “we stand ready to work closely with Congress… to close some of these [regulatory] gaps.”  The Bill demonstrates an earnest effort to provide greater legal clarity to the digital asset industry. Moreover, it aims to support the opportunities that the digital asset industry presents, while still applying sufficient safeguards and regulations to promote market integrity and consumer protection.  Industry participants have largely expressed appreciation for the Bill’s comprehensive and thoughtful approach, though some differ over the ramifications of specific provisions.  Some areas that merit further attention include:  Decentralization models need to have usable governance structures without such tokens being deemed securities. The Bill may be overly broad in stating mutually exclusive criteria that could define a digital asset security, and may capture many governance tokens as securities.  Although the Bill would require that the SEC and the CFTC issue a joint rulemaking no later than 270 days after the Bill’s enactment that categorizes each of the top 25 digital assets by market capitalization and daily trading volume, there is no indication whether such token issuers would be required to self-determine status prior to that official categorization, or whether such official determination would be subject to appeal. It would appear that self-determination of status would be required, because of thousands of digital assets in existence, at most 50 would receive official designation (although the number is in reality far less, as market capitalization and daily trading volume are highly correlated).  As noted above, the Bill would extend the definitions of certain CFTC-regulated intermediary activities to include engaging in the relevant intermediation activities with respect to “any contract of sale of a digital asset in interstate commerce, but not a digital asset security.” This provision would subject spot digital asset market participants to CFTC registration and regulation. While typically registration is an unwelcome development, this might be on balance a welcome approach if such federal regulation would relieve state licensing requirements under money transmission.

European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority,Response to EIOPA consultation on technical advice on the development of pension dashboards and data collection,Insurance Europe | Publications,Insurance Europe,"Insurance Europe  Response to EIOPA consultation on technical advice on the development of pension dashboards and data collection  Position Paper   Response  to  EIOPA  consultation  on  technical  advice  on  the   development of pension dashboards and data collection   Our   reference:   PERS-SAV-21-047  Date:  8 September 2021   Referring to:  Consultation Paper   Contact   person:   Margot Jilet Vesentini,    Senior policy advisor, Pensions   E-mail: JiletVesentini@insuranceeurope.eu   Pages:  12   Transparency   Register ID no.:   33213703459-54   Insurance Europe aisbl   Rue du Champ de Mars 23, B-1050 Brussels   Tel: +32 2 894 30 00   E-mail : info@insuranceeurope.eu  www.insuranceeurope.eu   © Reproduction in whole or in part of the content of this   document and the communication thereof are made with   the  consent  of  Insurance  Europe,  must  be  clearly   attributed  to  Insurance  Europe  and  must  include  the   date of the Insurance Europe document.   Q1.   Do you have suggestions for other sources of pensions data covering EU Member States that EIOPA   should consider?   Yes   No   If yes, please provide these suggestions.   In general, Insurance Europe believes that before recommending additional data collection EIOPA should first   and foremost assess and consider the data already available at national level, eg, the data collected by NCAs   or official national statistical databases or official data surveys.   Q2.   Do you agree that data on long-term savings instruments is not available as there is no commonly agreed   definition?   Yes   No   Please explain.   Insurance Europe believes it is important not to confuse the “availability” with the “comparability” of data. In   EIOPA’s draft technical advice, it is often said that data is not available, whereas in fact very often the data is   available but only at national level. Insurance Europe therefore believes that comparability is the issue EIOPA is   facing rather availability.   There is, indeed, no agreed definition of long-term savings instruments at EU level because many of the aspects   of what constitutes “long-term savings” have a national component. For instance, there are differences between   countries  in  terms  of  vehicles  available  and  commonly  used  to  prepare  for  retirement  (eg,  life  insurance,   2   investment products, etc.). Likewise, there are differences in terms of people’s preference for and use of bank   deposits. Some of these differences may be explained by other factors, such as people’s home-ownership rate   or medical coverage. As a result, even though it may be possible to agree on certain elements, a definition of   what constitutes a long-term saving investment only makes sense at national level.   If such information were to be collected, which definition would you consider and which products should be   included under its scope?   Insurance Europe believes it is important not to challenge national definitions of long-term savings instruments   and not to expand the pension dashboard scope beyond pension products and vehicles. Otherwise, there is a   risk  of  disrupting  well-functioning  pension  systems  and  introducing  unnecessary  complexity  in  the  pension   dashboard-related discussions.   Against  this  background,  Insurance  Europe  also  strongly  recommends  that  EIOPA  considers  the  national   definitions of what qualifies as a pension product in different countries. In some countries, the consideration of   death and disability benefits might be necessary to reflect the reality of pension-saving entitlements and to   monitor the adequacy and sustainability of pension systems at macro level.   Q3.   Could you give an indication of the costs (high, medium, low, none, don’t know) of collecting the following   data directly from private pension providers (IORPs, insurers, other), distinguishing DB, hybrid and DC as   well as occupational and personal pensions?   Insurance undertakings   High  Medium  Low  None   Don't   know   Number of members            x   -   breakdown by age            x   -   breakdown by gender            x   Number of products / plans            x   Liabilities            x   -   breakdown by age            x   -   breakdown by gender            x   Assets            x   -   breakdown by age            x   -   breakdown by gender            x   Asset allocation            x   Investment return            x   Costs and charges            x   3   High  Medium  Low  None   Don't   know   Contributions            x   -   breakdown by age            x   -   breakdown by gender            x   Benefits            x   Cash flows DB/hybrid pension obligations            x   Sensitivity  analysis  DB/hybrid  pension   obligations      x   Please  explain  your  assessment  of  the  costs  of  collecting  the  data  from  insurance  undertakings,  where   possible by providing estimates.   It is not possible to provide estimates at EU level because markets would be impacted differently by EIOPA’s   proposals. There is a huge diversity in terms of the granularity of data between countries depending on the   national reporting and disclosure requirements in place, as well as on whether or not there is a national   pension-tracking system. Most likely, costs would be comparatively higher for smaller providers and less   mature pension markets.   Updating reporting requirements at EU level to introduce such a level of harmonisation, detail and granularity   would be extremely costly for insurers to implement and review on a regular basis, but also for national   authorities to collect, compile and transmit.   Beyond the cost issue, the insurance industry is concerned about the feasibility of collecting EIOPA’s proposed   additional data. These proposals seem to ignore the fact that pensions are, to a large extent, a purely national   issue. As a result, there is agreement on the instruments that can be considered for achieving pension   adequacy. Similar discussions already took place in the context of many EU initiatives, eg, the introduction of   Solvency II and ECB reporting, with the conclusion that harmonisation was not a desirable outcome not only   due to the lack of political appetite but also, and importantly, because technically it was close to impossible to   implement.   In addition to reporting, Insurance Europe is also concerned that several aspects of EIOPA’s draft advice would   prove to be extremely expensive to implement and therefore challenge the viability of the pension-dashboard   project:     A live dashboard, as envisaged by EIOPA, would be more expensive than a report dashboard.     Too frequent updates, as recommended by EIOPA, would also increase costs. Considering that the main   bulk of data and indicators will come from triennial EC publications, it would not make sense to impose   more regular updates on private pension providers.     Modelling for private pension projections, as detailed by EIOPA, would not only be costly to establish   but also complex to manage.     The inclusion of variables like home ownership, wealth and individual savings, and possibly other long-  term savings instruments at a later stage, would add complexity and costs.   4   Q4.   Do you agree that the identified minimum set of quantitative data and more qualitative information are   necessary to enable the preparation of long-term pension projections?   Yes   No   Please explain.   As shown in EIOPA’s survey of NCAs, the way pension projections are being established, supervised and run   varies a lot across Europe and products. This is particularly true when it comes to assumptions, which, depending   on the country, can be established by law, by national authorities or even by providers themselves.   In  some  markets,  guidance  on  pension  assumptions  could  be  welcomed  at  national  level  but  harmonised   assumptions  at  EU  level  would  make  no  sense  given  the  diversity  of  pension  set-ups.  For  instance,  many   countries have established multi-pillar pension systems in order to diversify risks, but the mix between pillars   is unique to every country, reflecting the different historical, behavioural and political factors as well as social,   economic and fiscal policies implemented over the years. There are also different retirement ages to model for   each country. Having a single model able to grasp and adequately balance all these aspects is technically almost   impossible.   Moreover, EIOPA’s recommended approach to pension projections is not sufficiently substantiated to formulate   a final opinion:     It is unclear why using the 2019 IORP stress test as a common approach to model future returns for all   pensions would be adequate. Insurers have their own stress-test specification tailored to their business   and  activities.  In  general,  the  insurance  industry  would  always  urge  EIOPA  to  be  cautious  before   replicating discussions that take place in one pension context in another. A one-size-fits-all approach is   generally not adequate when it comes to pensions.     The  minimum  set  of  quantitative  data  recommended  by  EIOPA  is  rather  extensive  yet  not  always   comparable between countries, providers and products.     It is unclear how to factor projections into the qualitative data suggested by EIOPA as well as the impact   of government policies and behavioural assumptions.     Projecting DB , DC and hybrid entitlements requires clear definitions. To date, we are not aware of   agreed  definitions  at  EU  level  that  would  make  it  possible  to  consistently  project  various  pension   entitlements.  EIOPA  should  always  consider  national  definitions  of  pensions  and  projection   methodologies.   Insurance Europe would like to reiterate that performance projections are always an estimation and never a   guaranteed  outcome.  As  a  result,  projections  can  never  be  “real”;  considering  projections  as  guaranteed   outcomes or trying to factor in too many variables could be detrimental (for instance, in terms of complexity or   reliability of the outcome) without any added value for policymakers, national supervisors and savers.   Q5.   Do stakeholders have experience with making long-term pension projections that may be beneficial to   the discussion on - for example - minimal data needs, making assumptions, the level of granularity that is   most rewarding and taking into account the effects of government policy?   Yes      No   5   If yes, please share that experience.   At national level, Insurance Europe is aware of several countries (eg. DE, DK, NL) that have introduced stochastic   economic models to project the performance of their pension products. These models are considered successful   and efficient because they are tailored to the market.   At EU level, Insurance Europe has been involved twice in discussions about performance projections — first for   PRIIPs and then for PEPP — but has no practical experience in making long-term pension projections.   Discussions in the context of PRIIPs are still ongoing. Although PRIIPs are often by nature shorter-term products   than  traditional  pension  products,  implementation  of  the  framework  showed  how  complex  performance   projections are to perform and to explain to retail savers. There is no agreement on how best to do it for the   time  being.  Insurance  Europe  understands  that  some countries  (eg,  UK)  are  even  reconsidering  the  whole   performance projection idea, opting instead to move back to narrative explanations.    Pension projections were also discussed at length in the context of the PEPP Level 2 discussions. EIOPA proposed   a holistic approach to risk reward and performance with an economic stochastic modelling to derive PEPP KID   main indicators and condition the eligibility of risk mitigation techniques. While the PEPP is yet to be implemented   and therefore its efficiency and workability remains to be assessed, the insurance industry has expressed strong   reservations  about  the  modelling  of  PEPP  performance.  Factoring  in  stochastically  the  many  variables   recommended by EIOPA would result in very volatile and unreliable pension projections, which are not only hard   to understand but also challenging to perform. Even more worryingly, this might even have the adverse effect   of creating savers’ distrust due to the volatility and complexity. When it comes to measuring the risks and   performance of saving products over such long periods, even very small changes in assumptions and variables   can result in very different outcomes. The work conducted by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and   Development (OECD) on stochastic modelling for the PEPP shows that investment risk is the only decisive risk.   Additional  factors  such  as  unemployment,  wage  growth,  etc.  have  little  influence  and  lead  to  unnecessary   complexity.   Q6.   Do you agree that a live dashboard should be developed to present the pensions data as proposed in the   draft advice?   Yes   No   Please explain.   As explained by EIOPA in its draft advice, a live dashboard approach would be more expensive. Minimising costs   is essential to ensure the viability, feasibility and cost-efficiency of the project, which is already in itself very   challenging. In addition, pension systems are by nature long-term and the impact of reforms always takes a   long time to mature. Therefore, a live dashboard would not bring any added value to monitoring their adequacy   and sustainability.   A  report  dashboard,  focusing  on  a  few  meaningful  indicators  for  all  three  pillars,  therefore  seems  more   reasonable and more in line with the suggested methodology. As EIOPA is currently proposing to use as a   starting point data and indicators stemming from EC triennial publications, it would not make sense to require   other data providers to update information more regularly in a live dashboard.   6   Q7.    Do  you  agree  that  all  relevant  adequacy  and  sustainability  indicators  employed  by  the  European   Commission are reflected in the draft advice?   Yes   No   If not, please explain what indicators should be added / removed.   The insurance industry supports EIOPA relying on existing indicators and using data already available at EU   level. To ensure efficiency and minimise the compliance burden, it is important to use existing benchmarks that   are well implemented and have proven successful and relevant in the past. Insurance Europe also recommends   checking that new indicators are not redundant and do not overlap with existing ones.   The Pension Adequacy and Ageing Reports are useful and reliable tools and considered among the best sources   of information on pensions at EU level.   Q8.   Do you agree on the indicators proposed by EIOPA to complement the existing indicators of the European   Commission: coverage, financial variables relating to private pension providers, diversification between pay-  as-you-go and funded pensions?   Yes   No   If not, please explain what indicators should be added / removed.   The insurance industry does not disagree with the relevance of the additional indicators recommended by EIOPA,   but it questions the feasibility of collecting the underlying data at a reasonable cost and its comparability at EU   level.   While fully supporting transparency and agreeing with the objective of having a clearer picture of the current   pension  savings  landscape,  Insurance  Europe  is  concerned  by  the  fact  that  EIOPA’s  proposals  would  be   extremely burdensome to put into practice. More concerningly, they seem to ignore the fact that pensions are   to a large extent a purely national issue. As a result, there is no single approach to achieving pension adequacy   and sustainability and the "
US AML Regulations,What to Expect from Gary Gensler’s Testimony,NYT | Deal Books,The New York Times,"What to Expect from Gary Gensler’s Testimony  After five months on the job, the S.E.C. chair will speak before the Senate Banking Committee about crypto, climate, SPACs and more.  After five months on the job, the S.E.C. chair will speak before the Senate Banking Committee about crypto, climate, SPACs and more.  Gensler takes the hot seat  The S.E.C. chair Gary Gensler will testify before the Senate Banking Committee today, after five months on the job. Since his confirmation, his public statements have generated much debate, many headlines and more than a few market movements. This morning, based on his prepared remarks, he’ll make the case for additional resources to achieve a more expansive agenda than many of his predecessors at the commission.  Here’s what to expect on some hot-button issues:  Gensler wants to “freshen up” the rules. To promote efficiency and competition, he’s considering structural issues, like whether there is too much concentration among market makers, and conflicts of interest, like those arising from payment for order flow. Speeding up transaction settlements, which now take about two business days, is also a goal Gensler notes in his remarks, and one that Republican senators want him to pursue, a committee aide said.  When it comes to crypto, buyers beware. Gensler will say that the new digital currency markets resemble a time before securities laws: He wants more investor protection in crypto finance, issuance, trading and lending. Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, who has been outspoken about regulatory gaps in the crypto industry, will follow up on those concerns, an aide said. Senator Cynthia Lummis, Republican of Wyoming, will also press Gensler for regulation, but with an emphasis that reflects her support of the crypto industry. “We must have a balanced legal framework for digital assets that enables innovation and protects consumers,” she told DealBook in a statement.  More required disclosures on climate risk, human capital and cybersecurity are in the works. Perhaps sensing the resistance he’ll face on this issue, Gensler will note that “these proposals will be informed by economic analysis and will be put out to public comment, so that we can have robust public discussion.” Ranking committee member Patrick Toomey of Pennsylvania has pushed back on added disclosures on environmental, social and governance issues before, and he’ll likely renew these criticisms at the hearing.  Other priorities include greater transparency on SPACs, China and insider info. The surge in special purpose acquisition companies that allow businesses to go public with fewer rules than traditional I.P.O.s is cause for concern, Gensler will say, due to conflicts of interest he believes are “inherent” in the structures. He also wants the risks of Chinese companies that list on U.S. exchanges to be made more apparent. And Gensler will discuss efforts to “modernize” a rule known as 10b5-1 on executive stock sales, which helps insulate insiders from accusations of trading on nonpublic information.  It’s a lot. At the hearing, Gensler will get guidance from senators on what they think his priorities should be. How far he can advance his plans could depend, in part, on whether lawmakers give him more authority and resources. Like Gensler, committee chair Sherrod Brown of Ohio is keen on added transparency and stricter investor protections. Brown will open the hearing by saying that “the disconnect between the stock market and most Americans’ lives has never been more painfully clear,” and that, whatever the economic circumstances, “the hedge funds, the SPAC sponsors, the big banks, the brokers — the big guys seem to do just fine.”  HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING  Inflation may finally be slowing. Economists expect government data released today to show that prices rose last month at their slowest pace since February. However, a survey yesterday showed that consumer expectations for inflation are higher than they have been in more than seven years.  Apple issues an emergency patch to fix a flaw that gave hackers “zero-click” access to devices. The nonprofit watchdog Citizen Lab identified the flaw, which can be fixed by following these steps. It had been exploited by an Israeli spyware firm and signaled a serious escalation in the cybersecurity arms race.  Intuit is buying Mailchimp for about $12 billion. The deal is Intuit’s largest to date and a notable expansion for a company largely known for its finance software. Intuit wants to combine the email marketing services offered by Mailchimp with QuickBooks to help small businesses manage their customers as well as their accounts.  President Biden makes more nominations at key agencies. Alvaro Bedoya, a privacy expert and Big Tech critic, is the president’s nominee for a seat at the F.T.C., and Rostin Behnam, the acting chair of the C.F.T.C., who has backed efforts to mitigate climate risk, was nominated to lead the agency permanently. Meanwhile, the two men behind the Dodd-Frank act, which tightened financial regulation after the 2008 crisis, urged the renomination of Fed chairman Jay Powell, whose term expires in February.  Is uranium the new GameStop? The price of the radioactive metal has risen nearly 40 percent in the past month, with users of the influential Reddit investment board WallStreetBets talking up the shares of uranium mining companies. The switch to greener technologies could lift demand for the fuel for nuclear reactors, but some worry a new exchange-traded fund is inflating another market bubble.  Walmart gets pulled into a crypto hoax  Yesterday, a phony news release purporting to come from the retail giant Walmart announced a partnership with the digital currency Litecoin. This briefly drove up crypto prices and showed how vulnerable markets are to fake news in the social media age. The hoax is likely to bolster calls for greater regulation of the cryptocurrency industry, in which trading on largely unregulated markets can be susceptible to misinformation.  What happened: The market-moving event began with a release published on GlobeNewswire that revealed signs of inauthenticity upon close inspection but duped several news outlets, including Reuters and Bloomberg, which published articles based on it.  Litecoin quickly shot up in value, gaining 30 percent in a matter of minutes. Walmart refuted the release after it heard from reporters trying to confirm the announcement. Litecoin gave back most of its gains within an hour of the release, making the episode look like a classic pump-and-dump scheme, with a crypto twist.  Adding fuel to the initial news reports, the Litecoin Foundation retweeted the release on its official Twitter account before deleting it, saying that the retweet was a mistake by a social media manager. GlobeNewswire said the “illegitimate press release” was submitted by a “fraudulent user account” and that it was adding “enhanced authentication steps to prevent this isolated incident from occurring in the future.”  Securities lawyers predict an S.E.C. investigation and possible charges against the fraudsters, whose identity is unknown. “It is a misrepresentation involving a public issuer,” said Andrew Calamari, a lawyer with Finn Dixon & Herling, formerly at the S.E.C. “There is no question the S.E.C. has jurisdiction.”  A.O.C. spells out a message  Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York attended the Met Gala last night, a $300,000-a-table occasion packed with celebrities and fashion’s biggest names. In her first appearance at the event, the progressive Democrat wore a dress emblazoned with a clear message: “Tax the Rich.”  A Rise in Anti-Asian Attacks  A torrent of hate and violence against people of Asian descent around the United States began last spring, in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic.  Background:Community leaders say the bigotry was fueled by President Donald J. Trump, who frequently used racist language like “Chinese virus” to refer to the coronavirus.  Data: The New York Times, using media reports from across the country to capture a sense of the rising tide of anti-Asian bias, found more than 110 episodes since March 2020 in which there was clear evidence of race-based hate.  Underreported Hate Crimes: The tally may be only a sliver of the violence and harassment given the general undercounting of hate crimes, but the broad survey captures the episodes of violence across the country that grew in number amid Mr. Trump's comments.  In New York:A wave of xenophobia and violence has been compounded by the economic fallout of the pandemic, which has dealt a severe blow to New York’s Asian-American communities. Many community leaders say racist assaults are being overlooked by the authorities.  What Happened in Atlanta: Eight people, including six women of Asian descent, were killed in shootings at massage parlors in Atlanta on March 16. A Georgia prosecutor said that the Atlanta-area spa shootings were hate crimes, and that she would pursue the death penalty against the suspect, who has been charged with murder.  “The medium is the message,” Ocasio-Cortez wrote on social media. House Democrats yesterday presented a proposal to raise income taxes on the wealthiest individuals. However, the plan stopped short of measures that would target wealth and inheritances directly, leaving the largest fortunes alone.  (For sartorially conscious readers, Ocasio-Cortez said she borrowed the gown from New York-based designer Aurora James and her brand Brother Vellies. James, who attended the gala with Ocasio-Cortez, founded a campaign encouraging the world’s biggest retailers to dedicate 15 percent of their shelf space to products from Black-owned businesses.)  Asian Americans in finance face a ‘bamboo ceiling’  Asian American investment professionals are getting stuck in middle management. That’s one of the conclusions from a series of interviews and a survey of 100 finance professionals in the U.S. published today by the Association of Asian Americans in Investment Management. The Times’s Lananh Nguyen got a first look at the report for DealBook.  More than 90 percent of respondents to the poll said they had reached a “bamboo ceiling” that blocked them from climbing the corporate ladder, while around two-thirds said Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders were stereotyped as lacking leadership skills.  At investment firms, Asian American and Pacific Islanders “fill middle management ranks, but their percentages plummet in senior management and C-suites,” AAAIM wrote in the report. “Our research shows that this bias and these racial assumptions are a deep-seated obstacle for some of the industry’s most accomplished professionals.”  Respondents said they were often tapped as technical experts and benefited from the perception that they are good workers. But their advancement stalled as they sought more senior roles that emphasize networking and communication skills.  One senior executive said colleagues often mistook her for other women of Asian descent and treated them as interchangeable. Another investment manager said she received the nickname “Stephanie 2.0,” because white male co-workers preferred her over another Asian American woman with the same name who had worked there before.  “There were tons of personal comments and stories” about discrimination and bias at work, said Jim Park, the head of AAAIM, in an interview. “We’re at a moment in time in our community where people are beginning to say, ‘You know what? We do need to start to speak up.’”  THE SPEED READ  Deals  Forge Global, a trading platform for private firms’ shares, is planning a $2 billion I.P.O. via a SPAC merger.

Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act,Why are Americans being turned away from German banks?,The Local | Europe | Latest News,The Local,"Why are Americans being turned away from German banks?  The Local has heard reports of US citizens being refused bank accounts in Germany - or even having their accounts closed after they open them. Here's what's going on.  American customers have reported having headaches with German banking as a growing number of banks decide to exclude US passport holders from opening an account.  The latest bank to withhold access to its financial products is Kontist, a specialist online bank for freelancers that has partnered with Solarisbank. According to recent media reports, in the past few weeks, the neo-bank has sent out letters to American customers to inform them that their accounts are due to be closed.  One US citizen, who works as a freelancer in North-Rhine Westphalia, said the move amounted to “perfectly legal discrimination” on the part of the companies involved.  “I was informed by Kontist/Solarisbank just a couple days ago that my freelancer account will be closed with effect on October 31st, 2021,” she told The Local.  “I understand the complexity of the situation, but am still amazed that German legislation does not better protect Americans living in Germany when it comes to such matters. Conducting our personal and business affairs will become increasingly difficult if this trend continues.”  READ ALSO: Why bank customers in Germany are facing higher fees  Earlier in the year, Solarisbank froze the account of a Switzerland-based customer because they believed he may still have US citizenship, even though he had previously renounced it.  In a Tweet that has now been deleted, they informed him that, “for legal reasons”, he would need to send proof of his loss of US nationality in order to continuing banking with them.  “#Compliance was originally not meant to harm consumers with #discrimination” the former American tweeted back.  Though the situation was later resolved after the man sent the company proof that he had renounced his citizenship, the move points to a worrying trend for American expats, who feel they are being unfairly shut out of the banking system.  What’s behind this?  By the looks of things, it all dates back to a piece of American legislation that was passed way back in 2010. This legislation is the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, or FACTA for short, and it obliges foreign banks to report back to the U.S. tax office on any assets held in these accounts by U.S. taxpayers.  As American Expat Finantial News Journal (AXFNJ) has reported, banks were given a ‘grace period’ until 2019 – which was subsequently extended to 2020 – in order to get their houses in order before the legislation came into force.  Michael Ambuehl (L), state secretary of the Swiss Finance Department, and Don S. Beyer (R), US ambassador to Switzerland, exchange documents after signing the FACTA agreement, in Bern, Switzerland, in 2013. Photo: picture alliance / dpa | Peter Schneider  However, it seems that most non-US banks (and even some US-based ones) are still keen to avoid the additional hassle and cost of having to constantly update American government officials about the financial activities of their customers – and since the government can levy hefty fines to companies who don’t comply with FACTA, many banks seem to think it just isn’t worth the risk.  That’s certainly the case for Augsburger Aktienbank, a Bavarian bank that announced in late December 2020 that it would be closing its doors to all US citizens due to the regulatory burdens of FACTA.  The move even prompted dual German-American citizens to petition the German parliament to intervene in the issue, but so far, it seems nothing has been done.  Is this allowed?  At the moment, it appears that it is – at least, for anyone who doesn’t hold EU citizenship. While European Union legislation dictates that banks must provide a basic account to any EU citizen who requests one, which should mean that dual US/German citizens are entitled to receive banking services.  According to the European Commission’s website, its Directive on Payment Accounts “gives people in the EU the right to a basic payment account regardless of a person’s place of residence or financial situation.”  Aside from this, Germany appears not to have a specific legal framework that would prevent this type of thing – a situation that those who have bank accounts closed find astounding.  “I’ll never get my head around the fact that my freelance business account is being closed solely on the basis of my American citizenship,” the North-Rhine Westphalia-based freelancer told AXFNJ.  “The combination of a heavy-handed FATCA and current German legislation leaves me absolutely vulnerable to what is tantamount to perfectly legal discrimination, based on my nationality.  “The exact same thing could happen to my German private bank account at any time. How is this even remotely acceptable?”  EC legislation appears to protect European citizens from being denied a bank account – but not necessarily Americas. Photo: picture alliance / dpa | Mauritz Antin  There could be negotiations to improve the situation in the near future. In a resolution passed on July 5th, 2018, the EU unanimously called on both member states and the European Commission to go back to the negotiating table with the US government to change how FACTA is enforced. Once again, though, there doesn’t appear to be any movement on this just yet.  READ ALSO: Deutsche Bank set ‘to cut ties with Trump’  What options do Americans have now?  One option, as described by the NRW-based freelancer, is for Americans to simply to go “bank shopping” and find a bank that will accept them.  Another option, according to AXFNJ, is to open a State Department Federal Credit Union (SDFCU) checking account. These accounts are specifically designed to enable expats to access basic banking and mortgage facilities.  The Local has contacted Kontist for comment."
US AML Regulations,Cryptocurrency tycoon agrees to extradition to face US banking law charges,The Royal Gazette | All Stories,The Royal Gazette,"Cryptocurrency tycoon agrees to extradition to face US banking law charges  An Australian cryptocurrency mogul living in Bermuda today agreed to be extradited to the United States to face charges in connection with alleged money laundering. Magistrates’ Court heard that Gregory Dwyer, a senior employee at the cryptocurrency derivative exchange platform BitMEX, will be extradited if the request is approved by Lena Lalgie, the Governor. Arrangements will made to send Mr Dwyer, who consented to extradition, overseas if his extradition is approved. Magistrate Khamisi Tokunbo extended Mr Dwyer’s $20,000 bail. Mr Dwyer was charged on October 1 last year with violating the US Bank Secrecy Act and conspiring to violate the Bank Secrecy Act. The Act requires financial institutions to assist the US Government in combating money laundering schemes. Magistrates’ Court heard on July 1 that the District Court for the Southern District of New York had requested that Mr Dwyer be extradited to the US to face the charges. But Jerome Lynch, representing Mr Dwyer, requested an extradition hearing on behalf of his client. The US Justice Department indictment filed against Mr Dwyer and colleagues Arthur Hayes, Benjamin Delo and Samuel Reed alleged that the men “wilfully failed to establish, implement and maintain an adequate anti-money laundering programme, including an adequate customer identification programme, more commonly referred to as a know your customer programme”. The indictment alleged the BitMEX exchange was used by hackers to launder stolen money and by people in countries under US sanctions, including Iran. It also claimed the company solicited and accepted customers in the US, despite not being registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. It is also alleged the company continued to try and attract US business after it incorporated itself in the Seychelles in an attempt to avoid US oversight.

(“NYSE National” or the “Exchange”) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission   (“SEC” or “Commission”) the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II, below, which   Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization.  The Commission is publishing   this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.   I.  Self-Regulatory Organization’s Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule   Change   The Exchange proposes to delete the Order Audit Trail System (“OATS”) rules in the   Rule 6.7400 Series as these Rules provide for the collection of information that is duplicative of   the data collection requirements of the CAT.  Further, the Financial Industry Regulatory   Authority (“FINRA”) has determined to eliminate its OATS rules. The proposed rule change is   available on the Exchange’s website at www.nyse.com, at the principal office of the Exchange,   and at the Commission’s Public Reference Room.   II.  Self-Regulatory Organization’s Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the   Proposed Rule Change   In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements   1     15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1).   2     15 U.S.C. 78a.   3     17 CFR 240.19b-4.   2   concerning the purpose of, and basis for, the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it   received on the proposed rule change.  The text of those statements may be examined at the places   specified in Item IV below.  The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and   C below, of the most significant parts of such statements.   A.  Self-Regulatory Organization’s Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis   for, the Proposed Rule Change   1.  Purpose   Rule 613 of Regulation NMS requires national securities exchanges and FINRA to   create, implement, and maintain a consolidated audit trail to capture customer and order event   information for orders in NMS Securities and OTC Equity Securities, across all markets, from   the time of order inception through routing, cancellation, modification, or execution in a single   consolidated data source.  The Participants filed the Plan to comply with Rule 613 of Regulation   NMS under the Act.  The Plan was published for comment in the Federal Register on May 17,   2016,  4    and approved by the Commission, as modified, on November 15, 2016.  5  On August 14, 2020, FINRA filed with the Commission a proposed rule change to delete   the OATS rules once Industry Members are effectively reporting to the CAT (the “OATS   Retirement Filing”).  6    On October 29, 2020, FINRA filed Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule   change (“Amendment No. 1”) and a response to the comments that were submitted on the   4     See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 77724 (April 27, 2016), 81 FR 30614 (May 17,   2016).   5     See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 79318 (November 15, 2016), 81 FR 84696   (November 23, 2016) (“Order Approving the National Market System Plan Governing   the Consolidated Audit Trail) (“Approval Order”).   6     See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 89679 (August 26, 2020), 85 FR 54461   (September 1, 2020) (Notice of Filing of File No. SR-FINRA-2020-024).   3   original filing (“Response to Comments”).  7    On November 30, 2020, the Commission approved   the proposed rule change, as modified by Amendment No. 1, on an accelerated basis.  8    On June   17, 2021, FINRA filed a proposed rule change setting forth the basis for its determination that   the accuracy and reliability of the CAT meet the standards approved by the Commission in the   OATS Retirement Filing for purposes of eliminating the OATS rules.  9    The FINRA proposal   stated that FINRA would retire OATS effective September 1, 2021.   After conducting an analysis of its rules in accordance with the CAT NMS Plan, the   Exchange has determined that the information collected pursuant to the OATS rules is intended   to be collected by CAT.  Further, the Exchange believes that the Rule 6.7400 Series will no   longer be necessary and proposes to delete such rules from the Exchange’s rulebook.  Discussed   below is a description of the duplicative rule requirements as well as the timeline for eliminating   the duplicative rules followed by a discussion on the OATS Retirement Filing that formed the   basis for retiring OATS.    Duplicative OATS Requirements   The Rule 6.7400 Series consists of Rules 6.7410 through 6.7470 and sets forth the   recording and reporting requirements of the OATS Rules.  The OATS Rules require all   Exchange members and associated persons to record in electronic form and report to FINRA, on   7     See Letter from Lisa C. Horrigan, Associate General Counsel, FINRA, to Vanessa   Countryman, Secretary, Commission, dated October 29, 2020.   8     See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 90535 (November 30, 2020), 85 FR 78395   (December 4, 2020) (Notice of Filing of Amendment No. 1 and Order Granting   Accelerated Approval of SR-FINRA-2020-024).   9     See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 92239 (June 23, 2021), 86 FR 34293 (June 29,   2021) (SR-FINRA-2021-017) (Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of a   Proposed Rule Change Relating to the Retirement of FINRA’s Order Audit Trail   System).   4   a daily basis, certain information with respect to orders originated, received, transmitted,   modified, canceled, or executed by members in all NMS stocks, as that term is defined in Rule   600(b)(47) of Regulation NMS,  10    traded on the Exchange.  The Exchange relies on the   information reported to OATS either to conduct surveillance or to facilitate surveillance   conducted by FINRA pursuant to a regulatory services agreement (“RSA”).  This information is   used by Exchange and FINRA staff to conduct surveillance and investigations of member firms   for violations of Exchange and FINRA rules and federal securities laws.  The Exchange believes   it is appropriate to retire OATS because the requirements of the Rule 6.7400 Series are   duplicative of information available in the CAT and thus will no longer be necessary now that   the CAT is operational.   Timeline for Elimination of Duplicative Rules   The CAT NMS Plan states that the elimination of rules that are duplicative of the   requirements of the CAT and the retirement of the related systems should be effective at such   time as CAT Data meets minimum standards of accuracy and reliability.  11    As discussed in more   detail in the OATS Retirement Filing, FINRA believes that OATS may be retired effective   September 1, 2021 given the error rate thresholds have been met, and FINRA has determined   that its usage of the CAT Data has not revealed material issues that have not been corrected and   further confirmed that the CAT includes all data necessary to allow FINRA to continue to meet   its surveillance obligations.   10     17 CFR 242.600(B)(47).   11     Appendix C of CAT NMS Plan, Approval Order at 85010.   5   OATS Retirement Filing     In the OATS Retirement Filing, FINRA proposed to eliminate the OATS rules once   Industry Members are effectively reporting to the CAT and the CAT’s accuracy and reliability   meet certain standards.  Specifically, FINRA proposed that before OATS could be retired, the   CAT generally must achieve a sustained error rate for Industry Member reporting in five   categories for a period of at least 180 days of 5% or lower on a pre-correction basis, and 2% or   lower on a post-correction basis (measured at T+5).  In addition to the maximum error rates and   matching thresholds, FINRA’s use of CAT Data must confirm that (i) there are no material   issues that have not been corrected, (ii) the CAT includes all data necessary to allow FINRA to   continue to meet its surveillance obligations, and (iii) the Plan Processor is sufficiently meeting   its obligations under the CAT NMS Plan relating to the reporting and linkage of Phase 2a   Industry Member Data.   In the OATS Retirement Filing, FINRA explained that its review of CAT Data and error   rates would be based on data and linkages in the initial phase of reporting (or “Phase 2a”), which   replicate the data in OATS today and thus are most relevant for OATS retirement purposes.    Phase 2a Data includes all events and scenarios covered by OATS and applies only to equities.    FINRA did not consider options order events or Phase 2c data and validations, which are not in   OATS today, for purposes of OATS retirement.   As described below, FINRA has determined that the CAT meets the accuracy and   reliability standards approved by the Commission in the OATS Retirement Filing.   (1) Maximum Error Rates   As discussed in the OATS Retirement Filing, FINRA believes that relevant error rates are   the primary, but not the sole, metric by which to determine the CAT’s accuracy and reliability   6   and will serve as the baseline requirement needed before OATS can be retired. FINRA proposed   that, before OATS could be retired, the CAT would generally need to achieve a sustained error   rate for Industry Member reporting in five categories for a period of at least 180 days of 5% or   lower, measured on a pre-correction or as-submitted basis, and 2% or lower on a post-correction   basis (measured at T+5).  12    FINRA proposed to average the error rates across the period, rather   than require a 5% pre-correction and 2% post-correction maximum each day for 180 consecutive   days.  FINRA also proposed to measure the error rates in the aggregate, rather than on a firm-by-  firm basis.  Finally, FINRA proposed to measure the error rates separately for each of the five   categories, rather than evaluate all categories in the aggregate.  As noted above, FINRA’s   assessment of the error rates for Industry Member reporting is based solely on Phase 2a CAT   reporting for equity events since options orders are not included in OATS today.   As discussed in the OATS Retirement Filing, FINRA measured the error rates in each of   the five categories discussed below during the period from October 26, 2020 through April 26,   2021 (the “applicable period”).  FINRA commenced this period on October 26, 2020, which was   the date that Industry Members were required to begin correcting all errors for inter-firm   linkages and exchange/TRF/ORF match validations.  As discussed in the Response to   Comments, although the production environment for inter-firm linkage and exchange/TRF/ORF   match validations was open for testing as of September 28, 2020, FINRA did not believe it   12     As clarified in the OATS Retirement Filing, although FINRA does not believe that post-  correction errors need to be de minimis before OATS can be retired, FINRA was not   suggesting, with the proposal, that 2% would meet the ultimate objective of de minimis   error rates for CAT.  See CAT NMS Plan, Appendix C, note 102 (error rates after   reprocessing of error corrections are ultimately expected to be de minimis for the CAT).    See also Approval Order.   7   would be appropriate for the 180-day period to commence prior to the October 26, 2020   compliance date.  13  Rejection Rates and Data Validations.  As described in the OATS Retirement Filing, the   Plan Processor must perform certain basic data validations,  14    and if a record does not pass these   basic data validations, it must be rejected and returned to the CAT Reporter to be corrected and   resubmitted.  FINRA proposed that over the 180-day period, aggregate rejection rates must be no   more than 5% pre-correction or 2% post-correction across all Industry Member Reporters.    FINRA has determined that, over the applicable period, aggregate rejection rates across all   Industry Member Reporters were 0.03% pre-correction and 0.01% post-correction.   Intra-Firm Linkages.  As described in the OATS Retirement Filing, the Plan Processor   must be able to link all related order events from all CAT Reporters involved in the lifecycle of   an order.  At a minimum, this requirement includes the creation of an order lifecycle between all   order events handled within an individual CAT Reporter, including orders routed to internal   desks or departments with different functions (e.g., an internal ATS).  FINRA proposed that   aggregate intra-firm linkage rates across all Industry Member Reporters must be at least 95%   pre-correction and 98% post-correction.  FINRA has determined that, over the applicable period,   aggregate intra-firm linkage rates across all Industry Member Reporters were 99.97% pre-  correction and 99.99% post-correction.   13     See FINRA’s Response to Comments, supra note 8.   14     Appendix D of the CAT NMS Plan, Section 7.2, for example, requires that certain file   validations (e.g., file transmission and receipt are in the correct formats, confirmation of a   valid SRO-Assigned Market Participant Identifier, etc.), and syntax and context checks   (e.g., format checks, data type checks, consistency checks, etc.) be performed on all   submitted records.   8   Inter-Firm Linkages.  As described in the OATS Retirement Filing, the Plan Processor   must be able to create the lifecycle between orders routed between broker-dealers.  FINRA   proposed that at least a 95% pre-correction and 98% post-correction aggregate match rate be   achieved for orders routed between two Industry Member Reporters.  FINRA has determined   that during the applicable period there was a 99.08% pre-correction and 99.84% post-correction   aggregate match rate for orders routed between two Industry Member Reporters.   Order Linkage Rates. As described in the OATS Retirement Filing, in addition to   creating linkages within and between broker-dealers, the Plan Processor must be able to create   lifecycles to link various pieces of related orders.  For example, the Plan requires linkages of   order information to create an order lifecycle from origination or receipt to cancellation or   execution.  This category essentially combines all of the order-related linkages to capture an   overall snapshot of order linkages in the CAT.  15    FINRA proposed that there be at least a 95%   pre-correction and 98% post-correction rate for order linkages that are required in Phase 2a.    FINRA has determined that during the applicable period there was a 99.66% pre-correction and   99.93% post-correction rate for order linkages required in Phase 2a.  16  15     See FINRA’s Response to Comments, supra note 8.   16     FINRA noted that in Phase 2a, linkage is required between the representative street side   order and the order being represented when the representative order was originated   specifically to represent a single order (received either from a customer or another   broker-dealer) and there is: 1) an existing direct electronic link in the firm’s system   between the order being represented and the representative order, and 2) any resulting   executions are immediately and automatically applied to the represented order in the   firm’s system.

The 2015-founded startup‘s existing investors OpenOcean, Episode 1 and Entrepreneur First also participated in the round. The Series […]  London-based PassFort, a SaaS provider that helps business meet compliance requirements such as KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) reporting, has closed a $16.2 million Series A led by U.S. growth equity fund Level Equity.  The 2015-founded startup‘s existing investors OpenOcean, Episode 1 and Entrepreneur First also participated in the round. The Series A is a mix of equity and debt, with $4.89 million worth of venture debt being provided by Shard Credit Partners.  PassFort tells TechCrunch it now has 54 customers in total, saying the majority are in the digital payments space. It’s also selling its SaaS to customers in foreign exchange, banking and (ofc) crypto. It also touts some “major” customer wins preceding this raise — name-checking the likes of Curve and WorldRemit.  The new funding will be put toward1 stepping up its growth globally — with PassFort noting it’s hired a new C-suite for its growth team to lead the planned global push.  It’s also hiring more staff in business development and marketing, and plans to significantly bump spending across marketing, sales and customer support roles as it gears up to scale up.  “On the product side we are developing the solution to meet the demands of the changing digital economy and the threats it faces,” says CEO and co-founder Donald Gillies. “This means investing heavily into our new compliance policy cloud, system-to-system integrations with market-leading CRM and transaction monitoring systems as well as building a data team capable of deriving valuable real-time insights across our customer network.”  PassFort says its revenues grew ~2.5x over the past 12 months.  Gillies credits COVID-19 with really hitting the digital “accelerator” and driving adoption for compliance tools, as fintechs and regulated businesses look to streamline their approach to customer on-boarding and risk monitoring.  Alongside this accelerated digital transformation, he also points to a rise in cyber crime and increasingly sophisticated financial crime driving demand for compliance tools, and a “huge” rise in the number of regulations announced since COVID-19, noting: “Estimates from those who track regulatory changes stated that by August 2020, more than 1,330 COVID-19 related regulatory announcements had been made globally by regulators.”  As well as serving up an “always-on picture of risk”, as PassFort’s marketing puts it, the platform offers a single place to access and manage customer profiles, while also centralizing records for audit purposes.  PassFort’s SaaS also tracks efficiency — supporting customers to see where holdups in the onboarding process might be, to help with customer experience as well as the wider support it offers to compliance teams.  The startup says its integration model is such that it can “ingest data sets from any provider and interoperate with any system”, so — for example — it has pre-built connectors to more than 25 data providers at this stage.  It also offers a single API to integrate with a customer’s existing back-office system.  Another feature of the SaaS it flags is a focus on “low to no-code” — to increase accessibility and help customers with high complexity in their compliance needs (such as multiple customer types, multiple product lines and multi-jurisdictions). This includes a smart policy builder with a “drag and drop” interface to help customers configure complex workflows.  On the competitive side, PassFort names Dublin-based Fenergo as its closest competitor but says it’s targeting a broader market — likening its own product to “Salesforce for compliance teams” and saying its goal is to get the SaaS into the hands of “every financial crime and compliance team in the world”.  Commenting in a statement, Charles Chen, partner at Level Equity — who’s now joining PassFort’s board of directors — added: “Over the last few years, financial institutions and organisations have experienced exponential growth in business volumes and data, which has only increased the complexity in staying compliant with ever-evolving regulatory laws. In parallel, we’ve experienced an unprecedented rise in sophisticated financial crime activity as channels into financial systems have been digitized.  “This has underscored the importance of compliance matters such as AML/KYC, yet companies often have to weigh the trade-offs between speed, compliance and automation. PassFort has solved this challenge by providing a next-generation RegTech software solution that enables customers to offer a seamless customer onboarding experience, maintain best-in-class monitoring capabilities, and balance automation vs. human touch via its intelligent orchestration engine. We are thrilled to partner with the industry thought leader in this space and look forward to supporting the company’s future growth initiatives.”"
HIPAA - Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act,Clinical Trial Kitting,Contract Pharma | Supply Chain,Contract Pharma,"Clinical Trial Kitting  Claudia Berrón and Arbi Harootoonian, Avantor  And every stage of the process demands integrity. Failures in the collection kit workflow can increase a clinical trial’s timeline and raise costs. But failures can have a far more significant impact. From early-stage samples that can serve as indicators of a drug’s safety to samples for an orphan drug that can save a patient’s life, there simply is no room for error.  While in some cases, pharmaceutical companies and CROs have in-house kitting operations, their expertise and value lie in establishing study protocols and managing clinical trials. As a result, they may not always be the right solution to help meet the challenges of the current clinical trial landscape.  As an alternative, outsourcing to a specialized kitting operator can provide expertise and resources that allow clinical trial managers, researchers and support staff to focus on what’s important—managing successful trials. The right outsourced kitting partner is well-equipped to meet the challenges pharmaceutical companies and CROs face.  Increasing drug complexity  Scientific advancement in molecular diagnostics and heavier incorporation of specialized biomarker testing in clinical research has resulted in more complex clinical trial kits. Instead of a simple kit with a few components, a gene therapy trial kit might require double-digit components with specialized molecular testing tubes. Factors like this can add to a clinical trial’s time and cost and must be considered during protocol development so the trial can stay on track and on budget.  What’s more, because a specific patient’s treatment may depend on the viability of each sample collected for a complex therapy, it makes it critical to ensure that the kit enables proper sampling collection, preparation and packaging.  An experienced kitting partner can support clinical trials testing in a wide range of clinical proto-cols, for standard trials as well as for these emerging therapies. Whether the collection kit requires a procurement of a nonstandard kit component or a protocol-appropriate substitution for a com-ponent that suddenly becomes unavailable, this type of specialized expertise can ensure smoother, more efficient clinical trials for even the most complex therapies.  Growing use of decentralized trials  The trend toward hybrid and virtual trials has impacted collection kits. For example, collection kits going to patients’ homes may need specialized components that allow patients to self-collect samples.  Direct-to-patient kits also require special packaging consideration to ensure compliant sample packaging and transportation back to the testing lab, while adhering to temperature requirements and shipping regulations. This clinical trial model must also leverage patient-friendly services such as U.S. Postal Service or local carrier drop off sites convenient to the patient’s location.  Decentralized trials expand challenges seen in traditional clinical trials. From the logistics required to ship collection kits to thousands of homes rather than a few select clinical sites, to the increased need for data compliance, particularly related to HIPAA, the trend toward decentralized trials creates specialized issues that a third-party kitting partner can help navigate.  For example, an outsourced kitting operator will work to understand the trial protocols and kitting requirements. Then they can identify and procure components for custom, direct-to-patient kits, as well as provide specialized inventory and logistics support that ensures the patients have what they need, when they need it, to properly collect and return samples.  Expanding clinical trials into emerging regions  Clinical trials are increasingly conducted in emerging regions, such as the BRICS block (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) and the Middle East. Driven by these regions’ diverse populations, increasing chronic disease prevalence and operational cost-efficiency, sponsors sending clinical trial kits to these countries are met with a new set of challenges.  In addition to regulations that vary from region to region, in some areas regulatory guidelines continue to evolve. Inadvertent violations can increase costs and add time to the clinical trial. Collection kits must be compliant with a specific jurisdiction’s import requirements to reduce delays and ensure kits are delivered on time—all while protecting sample integrity. Transporting collection kits might need different transportation modes within a single area, each requiring specific types of paperwork.  Regulation for sample collection also vary by country, with some requiring in-country sample permanence. As with the increasingly complex global trial stage, this will require all kits to have proper documentation for in-country logistics, while other kits within the same protocol will require global logistics documentation. Working closely with the sponsors, specialized kitting operators can help navigate the logistical paths for all kitting needs.  Infrastructure can create additional kitting challenges in emerging regions. For example, a specific area might be prone to frequent power outages, which can impact kits with elements or samples requiring refrigeration.  An outsourced kitting partner with global expertise or contact with a region’s local experts can ensure that collection kits are fully compliant no matter where the trial is conducted. Likewise, this specialized expertise can ensure kits are properly prepared for situations that might not typically impact a study conducted in a Western country.  Expanding need for supply chain reliability  Although the components of an individual collection kit might vary from trial to trial, one factor remains key: a consistent, reliable supply chain.  Supply chain issues are among the most common reasons for sample integrity failure, from kits not arriving at the collection site on time to temperature breaches that destroy samples. The collection kit may require personnel trained and licensed to manage cold-chain custody or dispose of hazardous, radioactive or controlled substances.  Traceability is a key component of the kitting supply chain too. Experienced freight management is required to transport, protect and track valuable assets and ensure supply chain integrity.  The so-called Amazon effect plays a role, too, in the expectations of researchers, clinical trial man-agers and patients. Kits need to be available when and where they are needed, but, beyond that, stakeholders want the more transparent experience common in consumer transactions, including visibility into where the kits are in the supply chain—and when they’re expected to arrive.  Working with a third-party kitting operator skilled in compliant, temperature-controlled logistics can help ensure the kits are accurately and securely tracked, traced and delivered, from the kitting assembly facility to the collection site to the central lab and beyond.  Increasing need for data integrity and compliance  Data management is quickly becoming an important consideration in the clinical trial ecosystem—and data collection begins with the kit. Bar codes applied to a clinical trial kit and its components during production are key to end-to-end traceability for the kit and samples.  Bar code labeling is a core component to secure, transparent logistics, but it also plays a key role in the trial itself. Bar codes tie the physical sample to the patient’s specific information, as well as informed consent. The data’s value lies not just in the trial for which patient is enrolled, but it’s also valuable as a potential sample for future drug development.  To protect sample and trial integrity, data management systems for collection kits must also be compliant with HIPAA, GDPR or regulations relevant in other regions.  An outsourced kitting partner can be invaluable for establishing data consistency across an organization conducting multiple clinical trials. By standardizing data, a specialized kitting operator reduces the need for the manual data collection that can lead to discrepancies that delay trials, increase costs or risk sample integrity. Just as importantly, data standardization helps trials stay compliant and helps identify that sample as a potential research asset for a future clinical trial.  Evolving regulatory environments  Regulatory standards for kitting typically fall under medical device standards, which in the U.S. is governed by the FDA. BioPharma and clinical service providers focused on the clinical drug development process may not have the in-house expertise to ensure collection kits are compliant with FDA medical device guidelines.  In addition, even in well-established markets, regulations continue to shift, requiring clinical trial kitting with the flexibility to adjust to new standards, such as the EUMDR regulation that impacted Europe in May 2021.  It’s essential for sponsors and CROs to work with third-party kitting operators familiar with proper regulation and oversight and, furthermore, possessing all the right registrations and quality systems to ensure compliance. Partnering with experienced third-party kitting operators, particularly during protocol development and the submission process, can help avoid these challenges.  Considerations when choosing an outsourced kitting partner  The first step in assessing and choosing the right outsourced partner is a full audit. This provides you with insight into the company’s quality systems and operational processes. In addition to a full audit that helps you establish trust with your kitting partner, there are other key considerations. Choose a kitting operator able to:  Provide flexibility: The clinical trial landscape is changing more quickly than ever. Consider the COVID-19 pandemic’s fast-tracking of the decentralized clinical trial model, or Brexit’s recent impact on the supply chain in Europe. You need a partner with the flexibility to adapt to those changes quickly and efficiently so your clinical trials stay on track.  Manage diverse and changing trial needs: Needs change from trial to trial, so a kitting partner should be able to provide you with any solution you need, from small, one-site trials to global, decentralized trials and from simple collection kits to the most complex.  Evolve alongside technology: From apps that assist patients in collecting their own samples to collection tubes laser-etched with a patient’s bar code, an outsourced kitting partner should have the expertise and resources to assess, adopt and embrace the emerging digitalization technologies that make your sample collection more efficient.  Build a partnership: The more complex clinical trials become, the more important it is for working teams to continuously collaborate so they can quickly address new challenges, including protocol changes. Consider a third-party kitting operator that will assign a project manager to work closely with your team to develop protocol-driven solutions.  Ultimately the right outsourced partner will give you the freedom to focus on what you do best—develop innovative treatments that change lives."
Fair Debt Collection Practices Act,"Robbins v. Med-1 Solutions, LLC",Justia | Weekly Opinion Summaries by Practice Area | Legal Ethics,Justia,"Robbins v. Med-1 Solutions, LLC  Robbins defaulted on a debt to a hospital for services provided to her children. After MED-1, hired to collect the debt, filed a small-claims action, Robbins paid the $1,499 debt but refused to pay $375 attorney’s fees as required by the agreement she signed with the hospital. MED-1 then incurred more attorney’s fees (fees-on-fees) attempting to recover the initial attorney’s fees. The Indiana small-claims court ordered Robbins to pay both the initial attorney’s fees and the fees-on-fees. Robbins’s appeal initiated a de novo proceeding, so MED-1 filed a new complaint. Robbins filed a federal suit against MED-1 under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. 1692–1692p. A magistrate stayed the case pending the outcome of the state case, which was eventually dismissed for failure to prosecute. In federal court, Robbins raised res judicata, arguing that the state court’s dismissal precluded MED-1 from claiming that the contract required her to pay attorney’s fees and fees-on-fees. Alternatively, she advanced an argument that she was not required to pay fees-on-fees and that MED-1 violated the Act by trying to collect sums she did not owe. The Seventh Circuit affirmed judgment for MED-1. The Indiana court’s dismissal does not have preclusive effect. Because Robbins’s contract with the hospital required her to pay all collection costs, including attorney’s fees, MED-1 did not violate the FDCPA by attempting to collect fees-on-fees.

The Indiana small-claims court ordered Robbins to pay both the initial attorney’s fees and the fees-on-fees. Robbins’s appeal initiated a de novo proceeding, so MED-1 filed a new complaint.  Robbins filed a federal suit against MED-1 under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. 1692–1692p. A magistrate stayed the case pending the outcome of the state case, which was eventually dismissed for failure to prosecute. In federal court, Robbins raised res judicata, arguing that the state court’s dismissal precluded MED-1 from claiming that the contract required her to pay attorney’s fees and fees-on-fees. Alternatively, she advanced an argument that she was not required to pay fees-on-fees and that MED-1 violated the Act by trying to collect sums she did not owe. The Seventh Circuit affirmed judgment for MED-1. The Indiana court’s dismissal does not have preclusive effect. Because Robbins’s contract with the hospital required her to pay all collection costs, including attorney’s fees, MED-1 did not violate the FDCPA by attempting to collect fees-on-fees.

MED-1 SOLUTIONS, LLC, Defendant-Appellee. ____________________ Appeal from the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, Indianapolis Division. No. 1:14-cv-01703-TAB-SEB — Tim A. Baker, Magistrate Judge. ____________________ ARGUED SEPTEMBER 30, 2020 — DECIDED SEPTEMBER 14, 2021 ____________________ Before SYKES, Chief Judge, and WOOD and BRENNAN, Circuit Judges. SYKES, Chief Judge. Ann Robbins defaulted on a small debt to an Indiana hospital system for services provided to her minor children. The hospital hired MED-1 Solutions, LLC (“MED-1”), to collect the debt. After MED-1 filed a smallclaims action, Robbins paid the debt but refused to pay attorney’s fees as required by the agreement she signed when the care was provided. MED-1 then incurred more 2 No. 20-1343 attorney’s fees—the parties refer to these as “fees-on-fees”— as the small-claims proceeding moved forward for the purpose of recovering the attorney’s fees that were initially incurred. The small-claims court ordered Robbins to pay both the initial attorney’s fees and the fees-on-fees, and she appealed to the Marion County Superior Court. Under thenexisting Indiana law, the appeal initiated a de novo proceeding, so MED-1 filed a new complaint. Meanwhile, just before the final hearing in small-claims court, Robbins filed suit against MED-1 in the Southern District of Indiana seeking damages under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (“FDCPA” or “the Act”), 15 U.S.C. §§ 1692–1692p. Among other claims, she alleged that MED-1 violated the Act by attempting to collect attorney’s fees and fees-on-fees that were not contractually owed. A magistrate judge stayed the case to await the outcome of the state proceedings. But the state-court case sat dormant for a long time. Perhaps because the stakes were so small, MED-1 didn’t pursue it, and the Superior Court eventually dismissed it for failure to prosecute. Robbins then returned to federal court and revived the FDCPA case, and the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. As relevant here, Robbins raised res judicata, arguing that the state court’s dismissal order precluded MED-1 from claiming that the contract required her to pay attorney’s fees and fees-on-fees. In the alternative, she advanced a contractual argument that she was not required to pay fees-on-fees. These alternatives formed the basis of her FDCPA claim; she contended that MED-1 violated the Act by trying to collect sums she did not owe. The magistrate judge rejected these arguments and entered judgment for MED-1. No 20-1343 3 We affirm. The Superior Court’s dismissal order does not have preclusive effect here. And because Robbins’s contract with the hospital system required her to pay all collection costs, including attorney’s fees, MED-1 did not violate the FDCPA by attempting to collect fees-on-fees in the statecourt proceedings. I. Background In 2013 Robbins incurred a medical debt to Community Health Network, Inc., a hospital system in central Indiana, for medical services provided to her children. At the time of the services, she signed a written agreement to pay the charges the hospital billed to her, together with collection costs if she failed to do so: “In the event I do not pay such charges when due, I agree to pay costs of collection, including attorney[’s] fees and interest.” Robbins did not pay the charges billed to her, so Community Health referred the account to MED-1 for collection. Initial collection efforts were unsuccessful, so in July 2014 MED-1 sued Robbins in Lawrence Township Small Claims Court seeking $1,499 in unpaid medical bills and $375 in attorney’s fees on Community Health’s behalf. Robbins disputed the debt and obtained an order for discovery from the small-claims court. After MED-1 provided documentation, she agreed that she owed the $1,499 in medical charges and paid that amount in full. But she refused to pay the attorney’s fees. MED-1’s lawyer explained that because of her discovery request, his actual fees were now higher than the $375 he had originally sought. He offered to accept $375 to settle the dispute over fees. He also warned her that his fees would increase if he was forced to 4 No. 20-1343 spend more time on the case, inevitably making her liable for fees-on-fees. Robbins rejected the settlement offer. Following a hearing, the small-claims court ruled in MED-1’s favor and ordered Robbins to pay $1,725, which included an award of attorney’s fees and fees-on-fees. Robbins appealed the case to the Marion County Superior Court. Under Indiana law in effect at that time, an appeal from a small-claims judgment involved a de novo proceeding in the Superior Court. IND. CODE § 33-34-3-15. So MED-1 filed a new complaint. While playing defense in state court, Robbins went on offense in federal court. Nine days before the hearing in small-claims court, she sued MED-1 in federal court alleging several violations of the FDCPA. She twice amended her complaint, and a magistrate judge presiding by consent dismissed some claims and then abstained and stayed the case pending final resolution of the state-court case. See Colo. River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, 424 U.S. 800 (1976). But the state-court case had been dormant for almost two years and remained so for another fourteen months. For reasons unknown—but probably related to the small amount of fees at issue—MED-1 did not pursue the matter. In March 2018 Robbins moved to dismiss for failure to prosecute under Rule 41(E) of the Indiana Rules of Trial Procedure. On May 22, 2018, the Superior Court granted the motion and dismissed the case with prejudice pursuant to Rule 41(E). Robbins then reopened her federal action. The case was reassigned to a different magistrate judge, and the parties No 20-1343 5 filed cross-motions for summary judgment. Robbins raised several arguments, but only two are important here. She asked the judge to give the state-court judgment res judicata effect in the FDCPA action and bar MED-1 from arguing that the agreement with Community Health required her to pay fees-on-fees. She also claimed as a matter of contract interpretation that the costs-of-collection provision in the payment agreement did not cover fees-on-fees. Success on either argument would provide a basis for her FDCPA claim: if she wasn’t obligated to pay fees-on-fees—either because MED-1 was barred from contesting the point or because the contract did not require her to do so—then MED-1 arguably violated the Act by trying to collect sums it was not legally entitled to collect. The magistrate judge rejected these arguments, denied her motion, and entered judgment for MED-1. This appeal followed. II. Discussion We review a summary judgment de novo. Richards v. PAR, Inc., 954 F.3d 965, 967 (7th Cir. 2020). We begin with Robbins’s res judicata argument, which is governed by Indiana’s preclusion rules. The Full Faith and Credit Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1738, requires us to “apply the preclusion law of the state that rendered the judgment to determine whether res judicata controls this case.” Hicks v. Midwest Transit, Inc., 479 F.3d 468, 471 (7th Cir. 2007). Indiana’s preclusion doctrine follows the norm of distinguishing between res judicata, or claim preclusion, and collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion. In Indiana, claim preclusion “acts as a complete bar to subsequent litigation 6 No. 20-1343 on the same claim between identical parties.” Edwards v. Edwards, 132 N.E.3d 391, 396 (Ind. Ct. App. 2019). Claim preclusion has four prerequisites: (1) the former judgment must have been rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction; (2) the former judgment must have been rendered on the merits; (3) the matter now in issue was, or could have been, determined in the prior action; and (4) the controversy adjudicated in the former action must have been between the parties to the present suit or their privies. Afolabi v. Atl. Mortg. & Inv. Corp., 849 N.E.2d 1170, 1173 (Ind. Ct. App. 2006). Where applicable, claim preclusion is a powerful prohibition against claim splitting; it bars claims that were actually litigated in the prior action and also claims that could have been litigated. Id. But claim preclusion applies defensively; it is invoked by a defendant who “seeks to prevent a plaintiff from asserting a claim that the plaintiff has previously litigated and lost.” Thrasher, Buschmann & Voelkel, P.C. v. Adpoint Inc., 24 N.E.3d 487, 494 (Ind. Ct. App. 2015). Offensive claim preclusion is nonexistent. A plaintiff cannot reassert a claim that he has already won. Issue preclusion, or collateral estoppel, is a related but somewhat different principle. Issue preclusion operates to bar a subsequent re-litigation of the same fact or issue where that fact or issue was necessarily adjudicated in a former suit and the same fact or issue is presented in the subse- No 20-1343 7 quent lawsuit. In that situation, the first adjudication will be held conclusive even if the second is on a different claim. Tofany v. NBS Imaging Sys., Inc., 616 N.E.2d 1034, 1037 (Ind. 1993). Unlike claim preclusion, issue preclusion does not require identity of the parties and can be used either defensively or offensively. “Regardless of whether the use is termed ‘offensive’ or ‘defensive,’ collateral estoppel is asserted against a party who had a prior opportunity to litigate an issue and lost.” Id. Defensive issue preclusion applies “when the defendant seeks to prevent a plaintiff from asserting a claim [that] the plaintiff had previously litigated and lost against another defendant.” Id. Offensive issue preclusion applies when the “plaintiff seeks to foreclose the defendant from litigating an issue the defendant ha[d] previously litigated unsuccessfully in an action with another party.” Id. (quoting Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 439 U.S. 322, 326 n.4 (1979)). Offensive issue preclusion raises concerns about fairness, however, so Indiana courts limit its use, allowing it only “subject to the requirements set forth in Parklane Hosiery.” Id. at 1038. The Supreme Court explained in Parklane Hosiery that allowing the offensive use of issue preclusion may be unfair when the “defendant in the first action is sued for small or nominal damages [and] may have little incentive to defend vigorously, particularly if future suits are not foreseeable.” 439 U.S. at 330. Robbins relies on res judicata—i.e., claim preclusion—but that strain of preclusion doctrine is no help to her. She 8 No. 20-1343 invokes preclusion offensively to establish a necessary predicate for her FDCPA claim. As we’ve explained, however, claim preclusion is a shield, not a sword. Her argument fares no better if reframed as one of issue preclusion. First, and most importantly, the Indiana Supreme Court has held that a dismissal for failure to prosecute under Rule 41(E) does not have issue-preclusive effect because “no issue was actually litigated.” Afolabi, 849 N.E.2d at 1176. That is independently sufficient to defeat Robbins’s preclusion argument. Second, as we’ve explained, Indiana law authorizes the offensive use of issue preclusion subject to considerations of fairness under the factors identified in Parklane Hosiery. One of those factors is the “incentive to litigate the prior action”—in particular, the minimal incentive to litigate when damages are small or nominal. Tofany, 616 N.E.2d at 1038 (discussing Parklane Hosiery). That factor looms large here. MED-1 did not have a strong incentive to prosecute the dispute over attorney’s fees in the Marion County Superior Court. It had already successfully collected the debt Robbins owed to Community Health; all that remained was a fight over $1,725 in attorney’s fees and fees-on-fees. There was little incentive to go to the mat in a de novo proceeding in the Superior Court over a sum of that size. Here, in contrast, MED-1 has been accused of acting unlawfully in seeking attorney’s fees and fees-onfees from Robbins on Community Health’s behalf. The answer to the underlying contractual question forms the basis for Robbins’s FDCPA claim, which carries the potential for liability for actual or statutory damages, an award of attorney’s fees, reputational harm to MED-1, and a prece- No 20-1343 9 dential decision that may undermine its long-term interests in efficient debt collection. Accordingly, for not one but two reasons, Indiana preclusion doctrine does not apply. Robbins cannot use the Superior Court’s dismissal order offensively to block MED-1 "
Equal Credit Opportunity Act,Biden’s Sell-Out to Radical Leftism Will Replicate the...,Heartland Institute | Blog | Politics,Heartland Institute,"Seton Motley  Biden’s Sell-Out to Radical Leftism Will Replicate the...  Joe Biden was never a bright man.  But then, as he was running for the presidency, it became readily apparent he was an un-bright man – addled with dementia, if not full-on onset Alzheimer’s Disease.  In the Democrat Presidential primary, the hard Left had lots of really awful Leftist candidates from whom to choose. How did Biden get the nomination? A Faustian bargain was struck:  “The Left would ignore Biden’s clearly deteriorating mental capacity — and Biden’s more-cognizant handlers would impose the most radical Leftist agenda in US history.”  And here we are.  The Left has spent decades and billions of dollars creating and stockpiling really awful polices to implement if they ever got the chance. After helping absentee landlord Biden fall backwards into the White House – now’s their chance.  Democrats’ $3.5 trillion “human infrastructure” bill is the repository of many of these fetid and festering Leftist notions.  But it’s the Biden Administration that is unilaterally going bananas with these things.  Unleashed has been a ragtag gaggle of radical Left people and organizations. And some tiny, never-before-heard-of joints – are having hugely outsized impacts on national policy.  In boxing parlance – this is minuscule Leftist outfits punching WAY above their weight.  One of the reasons many of these joints have remained mostly underground – is because of just how radical they are. Leftist Big Media doesn’t want to highlight them – because to highlight just how radical the Left is would be counterproductive to everyone’s efforts to advance Leftism.  We began in June writing about the The National Consumer Law Center (NCLC). Which has spent the last sixty years quietly devising ways to destroy large swaths of our economy. Including the entirety of the housing market.  Evictions: Another Awful Supreme Court Ruling — and an Awful Organization Making It All Worse  Using the Lockdown to Destroy the Entire Private Housing Economy  DC: The Home of Ridiculous Hearings and Terrible Ideas  DC Is Ensuring Only Billionaires Can Get a Loan — in the Name of ‘Helping the Little Guy’  We’ve discovered another awful joint working to destroy the housing market – by eviscerating the entire lending industry. Behold The Center for Responsible Lending (CRL).  The CRL wants to recreate the 2008 US housing crisis – that ultimately devastated the entire global economy.  Remember the 2008 housing crisis?  How Government’s Policies Led to the Financial Crisis of 2008:  “The financial crisis of 2008 is the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, which started with crisis in subprime mortgage market in the USA and developed into a global economic downturn, the Great Recession….  “(E)normous government intervention and regulation of the economy caused the financial crisis of 2008 and the Great Recession….  “Banks were required by the government regulatory agencies, i.e. the Fair Housing Act of 1968, the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act of 1974 coupled with ‘a totally misleading study by the Boston Federal Reserve bank – even the Fed currently acknowledges that this study was fundamentally flawed’ led to ‘energizing the affordable-housing/subprime-lending efforts that subsequently destroyed the residential real estate market.’  “Under these laws, especially under the CRA ‘banks had a legal duty to make high-risk home loans to low-income borrowers.’  “Even giant sponsored enterprises (GSEs) were forced by the Clinton administration to have ‘at least 50 percent of their loan portfolios in affordable housing (subprime) loans.’ which was incredibly risky and subsequently led to their failure.  “And these are only some of the examples how government agencies which were supposed to prevent the crisis led directly to its creation.”  Every single one of these idiotic laws – with their idiotic demands that banks lend money to people everyone knows can’t pay it back – is still on the books.  And the CRL wants to see that they are all ever-more-rigorously enforced.  Don’t believe me? Fine – let’s ask them:  “The Center for Responsible Lending (CRL) works to ensure a fair, inclusive financial marketplace that creates opportunities for all credit-worthy borrowers, regardless of their income….”  Emphasis ours – because come on.  And the CRL is a key player in all things anti-lender currently underway in DC.  Banks Brace for Tougher Rules Under Biden on Consumer Protection, Fair Lending:  “The Biden administration’s focus on racial equity also means banks likely will be required to lend and invest more in low- and moderate-income communities under revamped rules for the Community Reinvestment Act….  “Consumer advocates are looking to the Biden administration to ease lending standards that tightened during the pandemic, which they say has disproportionately harmed minorities who tend to have lower credit scores and less cash for down payments, said Mike Calhoun, president of the Center for Responsible Lending.”  But the CRL doesn’t stop there.  Remember the “student loan crisis?” Where millions of individual Americans each wasted four-plus years and hundreds of thousands of dollars getting a Leftist claptrap degree from a Leftist claptrap factory? And now are having trouble paying the loans back – because they learned nothing of actual value to themselves or society?  The Left – including the CRL – wants to “cancel” this debt.  For Many, Paying Student Loans Doesn’t Stop Balances from Growing; Advocates Push Cancellation as a Fix:  “(T)he National Consumer Law Center and the Center for Responsible Lending reviewed data from the U.S. Department of Education for over 400,000 student loan borrowers who have been making voluntary payments on their student loans during the Covid-19 payment pause.  “The report found that 63% of student loan borrowers who made payments during the Covid-19 forbearance still owe more now than they originally borrowed. One-third of these borrowers owe more than 125% of their original loan balance, despite the fact that no interest has been accruing during the moratorium.”  Leftist-to-English translation:  Government illegally froze interest on these loans. And illegally made loan payments voluntary. And the borrowers have been making payments so small they didn’t even cover the interest – when they were actually being charged interest.  And the aforementioned harmonic convergence of the NCLC and the CRL are a part of the Leftist amalgam demanding we “cancel” this debt.  Which means telling these lenders – out $1.6 trillion – to screw off.  That certainly won’t hurt the economy.  Just as recreating the 2008 global housing crisis won’t hurt the economy.  I have a thought. Unlike the NCLC’s and CRL’s – mine is rooted in reality and math:  If you don’t have an income large enough to justify a loan – you probably shouldn’t get a loan.  PHOTO: House.

Federal Insurance Contributions Act,What Taxes Do I Pay In Retirement?,Personal Capital | Blog,Personal Capital,"Brandon Berquist  What Taxes Do I Pay In Retirement?  One often-overlooked aspect of retirement planning is the impact of paying taxes in retirement.

The short and general answer is yes — individuals and couples generally have to pay taxes […]  One often-overlooked aspect of retirement planning is the impact of paying taxes in retirement. When people do consider this, they commonly want to know two things: Will they have to pay taxes in retirement, and is retirement income taxable?  The short and general answer is yes — individuals and couples generally have to pay taxes in retirement. Some of the taxes assessed while working will no longer be paid in retirement, but other taxes will still be due.  No More Payroll Taxes  One of the main taxes that’s no longer paid in retirement is payroll taxes or the self-employment tax if you were a self-employed individual.  Also known as FICA (Federal Insurance Contributions Act) taxes, these are withheld and paid by employers from employees’ paychecks to cover employees’ contributions to Social Security and Medicare.  FICA taxes are broken down as follows: 6.2% of wages for Social Security (capped at $142,800 of wages for 2021) and 1.45% of wages for Medicare (no limit), for a total FICA tax rate of 7.65%. Also, if you are a high income earner (earning more than $200,000 for single or $250,000 for joint filers) you may also have been subject to an additional medicare tax of .9%. Once you’re retired and no longer receiving a paycheck or generating income as a self-employed individual, you’ll no longer pay FICA or self-employment taxes.  Federal and State Income Taxes Remain  Assuming you have taxable income in retirement above certain thresholds, you will still be subject to federal income taxes as well as state income taxes if you live in a state that collects income tax or collects income tax on certain types of retirement income.  Read More: States That Don’t Tax Retirement Income  This includes income from pre-tax retirement plans like pensions, annuities, IRAs and 401(k)s. Such taxable income is taxed at the following ordinary income tax rates for 2021.  However, income derived from after-tax retirement accounts like Roth IRAs and Roth 401(k)s is not taxable in retirement at the federal or state level. This is because contributions to these types of accounts were made after taxes were paid on the income so the contributions have already been taxed.  Municipal bonds are another potential source of tax-free retirement income. Distributions from muni bonds are often free of federal, and sometimes also state and local, income taxes. Note: Muni bond gains may be subject to capital gains taxes upon disposition.  Distributions from Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) are also tax-free in retirement if the funds are used to pay for qualified medical expenses. If HSA distributions are used for any purpose other than qualified medical expenses, they’re subject to federal income tax at ordinary income tax rates. Additionally, if a non-qualified distribution from your HSA is made before the age of 65 you may still be subject to a 20% penalty on the distribution.  Read More: What Is the Average Retirement Income and How Do You Compare?  Other Taxes in Retirement  In addition to federal and state income taxes, you will also have to pay sales taxes when you retire. Sales taxes are assessed when you purchase goods and some services — everything from clothing and electronics to restaurant meals. How much you end up paying in sales taxes depends on your shopping habits and the sales tax rates in your city and state.  And if you own your home, you’ll have to continue paying property taxes after you retire. These are one of the biggest tax burdens for many retirees because property taxes are based on the value of the home, which may rise over time. If you itemize deductions on your income tax return, however, you may be able to claim property taxes as an itemized deduction, which would lower your tax bill. It is important to note that currently state income, sales and property taxes are subject to a $10,000 cumulative maximum deduction cap if you itemize your deductions.  Finally, depending on your income, you might have to pay the Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT) after you retire. This is a 3.8% Medicare surtax that applies to net investment income above certain thresholds. This generally includes interest, dividends, capital gains and losses, as well as income from passive sources. If your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) is above $200,000 (or $250,000 if you’re married and file your income taxes jointly) in 2021, you will be subject to the NIIT on all or a portion of your net investment income.  Are Social Security Benefits Taxable?  Approximately 56% of Social Security recipients have to pay income tax on their Social Security benefits.  Taxation of your Social Security benefits depends on whether or not you have modified adjusted gross income above certain levels after you retire. If you do, figure out your combined annual income by adding your nontaxable interest and half of your Social Security benefits to your adjusted gross income (or AGI). If you’re single and your combined income is between $25,000 and $34,000 a year — or if you’re married and file jointly and your combined income is between $32,000 and $44,000 a year — up to 50% of your Social Security benefits will be taxable.  However, if you’re single and your combined income is more than $34,000 a year — or if you’re married and file jointly and your combined income is more than $44,000 a year — up to 85% of your Social Security benefits will be taxable. No more than 85% of Social Security benefits is ever taxable, regardless of the amount of your modified adjusted gross income.  Some states also assess state income tax on Social Security benefits. Currently, they include Colorado, Connecticut, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Rhode Island, Vermont, Utah and West Virginia (which is phasing out state taxation of Social Security benefits this year).  While you may find that social security benefits may be taxable in these states, some of these states do provide for a lower limit on how much of the benefits may be taxed. Colorado for instance provides a subtraction limit for most types of retirement income sources (including Social Security benefits) up to $24,000 per individual if over 65 and $20,000 per individual if over 55.

Standard Instructions for Filing Forms Under the '33 Act and the '34 Act,ESG credentials driving value for miners on US exchanges,Lexology | USA News,Lexology,"Oliver Wright  Andrew N. Weisberg  ESG credentials driving value for miners on US exchanges  Contributor: White & Case LLP  Summary: Those companies that have repositioned themselves as part of the energy transition away from fossil fuels have been able to take advantage of this  Those companies that have repositioned themselves as part of the energy transition away from fossil fuels have been able to take advantage of this momentum and find favor among generalist investors in the US.  But the sector is also facing intense scrutiny over its ability to meet increasing environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards. It is far from alone in facing this scrutiny, with other sectors such as energy also under the public eye in relation to ESG issues. The UN Climate Change Conference set to take place in Glasgow in November 2021 will shine an even greater light on these issues.  It is clear that the mining & metals industry must play an important role in energy transition, both in terms of improving its own environmental footprint, but also in being a necessary contributor to the commodities needed to usher in a clean energy future.  The mining & metals industry is not homogenous. It consists of several subsectors, each with their own economic drivers.  Precious metals, industrial metals, construction materials and energy materials each follow diverging commodities cycles. While all miners must focus on ESG compliance, some commodity producers will benefit more than others as the economy turns its attention to an energy transition.  The interest in clean energy and decarbonization of the economy presents an opportunity for those operators producing commodities that are integral to the energy transition. Battery minerals such as lithium, nickel, cobalt and graphite are expected to see a marked increase in demand that many forecast will outstrip current supply.  45.5%  The Nasdaq has increased by 45.5% from January 2020 to January 2021 while TSX and ASX saw modest increases and LSE had a decrease in capitalization of 8.8%  Mining & metals industry has a key role to play in global energy transition, both in improving its own environmental footprint and by contributing commodities needed for a cleaner energy future  The shift to the US  Traditionally, mining companies have commonly found their home on one of three exchanges, in markets that have mining as a core component of the national economy: the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) and TSX Venture Exchange in Canada; the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX); and the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) in South Africa.  To an extent, the London Stock Exchange (LSE) has been the international market of choice outside of these three jurisdictions.  According to a comparison of overall domestic market capitalization from January 2020 and January 2021, the TSX and similar Canadian exchanges run by the TMX Group experienced an increase of 4.9 percent. The ASX saw more modest growth of 1.9 percent and the LSE Group had a decrease in capitalization of 8.8 percent.  However, the Nasdaq has increased by 45.5 percent during that time. Traditionally technology focused, the Nasdaq has seen some of the highest growth and influx of capital of stock markets in developed countries in recent years.  There is a great opportunity for miners with the right credentials to capitalize on this moment. Companies producing commodities that are integral to an energy transition and which can demonstrate ESG compliance are finding favor with US investors, and mining & metals companies are starting to gravitate to the US markets as a result, as the graph shows.  The data does not include the second half of 2021, and the first half of 2020 was affected by the pandemic. That just emphasizes the scale of the growth in new listings by mining & metals companies in the past two years.  US$12 billion  To date, SPACs with a mining or energy transition focus have generated, or are expected to generate, nearly US$12 billion from 50 separate initial public offerings  Rule changes facilitating moves  Mining-focused companies are taking advantage of the strength and depth of the US capital markets and the large amount of capital that companies listed on US exchanges have access to. A significant number of these companies have positioned themselves as suppliers to industries that are seen as pivotal to an energy transition, such as electric vehicle manufacturers, battery producers and the renewables sector.  Recent changes to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) disclosure rules for companies engaged in mining operations have also helped to facilitate these moves.  In late 2018, the SEC overhauled the relevant disclosure requirements by replacing its decades-old guidelines, set out in Industry Guide 7, with new subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K, based on the Committee for Mineral Reserves International Reporting Standards (CRIRSCO).  The new rules are mandatory for companies for their first fiscal year beginning on or after January 1, 2021. While the rules create a path to disclosure of resources and reserves for companies listing in the US, differences between the SEC rules and those in other jurisdictions based on CRIRSCO mean companies that have historically reported in jurisdictions such as Australia or South Africa will likely have to undertake a substantive update of their technical reports.  An exception to this exists in the form of the Canada-US Multijurisdictional Disclosure System (MJDS). The MJDS gives companies that are already listed and reporting on the TSX (or TSX-V) a more streamlined path to listing in the US.  Battery minerals companies have been leading the way, making the shift to the US. Canada’s Nouveau Monde Graphite, which has traditionally traded on the TSX Venture Exchange, has recently dual-listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Australian Piedmont Lithium, which has raised multiple rounds of capital through the use of American Deposit Receipts (ADRs) on the Nasdaq Capital Market, are two good examples.  In addition to traditional mining companies, special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) with a mining focus have also been able to generate capital from the US capital markets to an unprecedented degree. To date, SPACs with a mining or energy transition focus have generated, or are expected to generate, nearly US$12 billion from 50 separate initial public offerings.  Newcomers to the essential mining industry are now taking advantage of different avenues to capital that until now were untapped.  The US capital markets are the largest source of capital in the world for publicly traded companies, and mining & metals companies are in the perfect position to take advantage of these sources of capital, as long as they shape their messaging around ESG and what investors are looking for."

The revised Guidelines extend the scope of the DGS stress testing, by requiring more tests in comparison with the past Guidelines and by covering all the legal missions entrusted to the DGSs. The revisions aim to consolidate depositors’ confidence about the ability of their national DGS(s) to promptly repay their funds in case of banking failure. The revised framework also strives to achieve greater harmonisation and comparability of stress test results, which will enable the EBA to carry out a robust peer review of national DGS stress tests in 2025.  The EBA revised the existing guidelines to further strengthen the stress testing framework of DGSs, harmonise the approaches across Member States, and enhance comparability of test results;  The revised guidelines require that all DGSs test their abilities to perform all their functions and to access all their funding sources;  As a result of the revisions, depositors can have greater confidence in receiving their deposits, should their bank fails.

The cooperation between DGSs and other authorities is also strengthened, by requiring DGSs to stress test scenarios where such cooperation is necessary. In addition, the new provisions encourage the DGSs to stress test scenarios with additional business continuity challenges, such as a pandemic, ICT failures or other similar events.  The revisions of the Guidelines are based on the findings of the first EBA peer review of the DGS stress tests and resilience of national DGSs, which the EBA published in a report in June 2020, where it provided early indications of areas in which the DGS stress testing framework could be improved.  Legal basis  These Guidelines have been developed according to Articles 16(2), 26(1) and 26(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 (EBA Regulation).

FINRA,How communication compliance has become the biggest hurdle for financial firms,Fintech Global | Companies,Fintech Global,"How communication compliance has become the biggest hurdle for financial firms  With workforces becoming increasingly dispersed, methods of communication have escalated, making security compliance a key challenge for firms.  The Covid-19 crisis has prompted radical shifts in the corporate world. Companies have shifted to an entirely digital way of working, driving dependence on collaboration tools like MS Teams, Zoom and Slack.  Collaboration from anywhere has necessitated new approaches to meeting compliance mandates. For example, regulations from FINRA to MiFID II and GDPR all require new approaches to capturing, retaining, and reviewing conversations between organizations and their employees.  New technologies bring new challenges  The sudden shift to remote work and stricter regulations has complicated the communications landscape. The risks with collaboration tools span the traditional remit of security and compliance.  New needs have emerged, such as understanding employee and customer sentiment in real-time – and having an accurate record of dispute management and resolution.  Customer preferences have also changed in a world now driven by digital interactions with employees who are under constant pressure to use the preferred communication tools of clients. In addition, with different geographies choosing different platforms, employees find themselves hopping between phones and collaboration platforms, making it harder to monitor conversations across the numerous end-points.  In the words of Dubber chief customer officer Andy Lark, “The average employee is engaging in work conversations across more than four applications every day – such as mobile, Zoom, Cisco Webex and WhatsApp. As a result, FSIs are under pressure to capture 100% of conversations and messages wherever they may be taking place.”  While it’s critical to streamline communication and rein it in from a compliance perspective, data surveillance “places a huge burden on IT and compliance teams who have to maintain a visibility of all client-company interactions,” Lark said.  With recording metadata and transcriptions pulled from so many applications, data silos quickly build up and multiply. According to Lark, “This can lead to frustration when locating individual recordings for dispute resolution and communication audits by compliance teams. Failure to show that all calls are being recorded and stored compliantly can lead to company fines.” Furthermore, the challenge is not just recording conversations across those channels, but also stitching those interactions together across the customer journey”, he said.  To ensure companies stay clear of financial fines and security violations, they must expedite the required processes to capture, secure and make data easily accessible. Lark said, “Implementing unified conversational intelligence that’s able to capture, record and store crucial conversations wherever they may be taking place is vital to avoiding compliance breaches and addressing broader mandates to know both the employee and customer. In addition, unification circumvents the common issue of data silos occurring between teams, departments and business units.” That’s where Dubber comes in.  Unifying conversational data at scale  Unlike legacy call recording solutions that track a single end-point, a cloud-based unified solution – such as Dubber’s – captures all conversations, identifies chosen keywords and phrases across applications, and routes alerts to stakeholders through automated workflows. In addition, Lark said, “Unified Call Recording allows the compliant capture of recordings from any end-point and the secure storage of those recordings in a central repository for the FCA mandated, 7-10 years. There, access is in one location for quick and easy audit and dispute resolution.”  Its AI-powered Voice Intelligence allows compliance professionals to proactively identify potential breaches by scraping keywords from conversations as they occur. Consequently, addressing violations and fraud occurs in real-time, Lark added.  Connecting communication channels such as voice, video or text, into CRM systems are essential for ensuring advisors stay on top of their client’s expectations.  Lark concluded, “Clients are more focused on customer experience than ever. If you don’t cater to their communication needs, they will find financial services firms to communicate with on their terms. But more critically, answering the need to know the customer, know what was said, and know your compliance standing has become more critical than ever.”  Copyright © 2021 FinTech Global"
Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II,The EU crowdfunding regulation: a German perspective,Lexology | Corporate Finance/M&A,Lexology,"Taylor Wessing  The EU crowdfunding regulation: a German perspective  Contributor: Taylor Wessing  Summary: Crowdfunding is an innovative way of fundraising that enables prospective fundraisers to obtain necessary financing through small contributions from a  The EU crowdfunding regulation  Crowdfunding is an innovative way of fundraising that enables prospective fundraisers to obtain necessary financing through small contributions from a large group of investors.  In the US, the first regulation on crowdfunding was introduced back in 2015. However, the EU has lagged behind and individual Member States have created national crowdfunding frameworks that differ from one another. The lack of a harmonised regulatory framework has been a significant impediment to the provision of crowdfunding services on a cross-border basis.  The idea of a sole EU Regulation on crowdfunding that would bridge these gaps was set out in the EU Commission's FinTech Action Plan. However, the first draft of the future EU regulatory framework on crowdfunding was followed by a relatively long co-decision procedure of the European Parliament and the Council, during which various amendments to the original proposal were made. After more than two years of long and intense discussions between EU lawmakers, the final compromise text of the EU Regulation ((EU) 2020/1503) on Crowdfunding Service Providers (ECSPR) was adopted and published on 20 October 2020.  The ECSPR creates a level-playing field for operators of crowdfunding platforms in the EU by introducing a harmonised set of rules that will enable European crowdfunding service providers (CSPs) to explore the full potential of the EU Single Market.  The ECSPR will start to apply as of 10 November 2021. CSPs already operating under national regimes have been provided with a 12-month transitional period to ensure compliance with the new rules.  Application  The ECSPR covers two of the most common practices used by crowdfunding platforms:  Lending-based crowdfunding  Investment-based crowdfunding.  Some other types of crowdfunding practices, like donation-based crowdfunding or reward-based crowdfunding (where investors receive a non-financial consideration for their investment) will not be directly covered by the ECSPR.  Only crowdfunding offers with a consideration not exceeding EUR 5,000,000 per project owner over a 12-month period will be within the scope of the ECSPR. Offers exceeding this threshold will need to be made in accordance with general requirements on the issuing of financial instruments and the provision of regulated financial services (eg under the Prospectus Regulation, MiFID II etc).  Lending-based crowdfunding  The EU legislator has emphasised that this crowdfunding practice should be clearly distinguished from the activities of regulated credit institutions that grant credits for their own account and take deposits or other repayable funds from the public. The operator of a crowdfunding platform acts as an intermediary who merely facilitates the execution of a loan agreement between the borrower (project owner) and the lender (investor) without acting as a lender or a borrower itself.  Under the ECSPR, the term 'loan' refers to an agreement in which a defined amount of money is made available to the project owner:  for an agreed duration  which creates an unconditional repayment obligation of the advance (together with accrued interest) to the investor  in accordance with the instalment payment schedule.  Despite seeming quite straightforward, this definition excludes certain types of loan agreements, e.g. qualified subordinated loan agreements.  In addition to the simple facilitation of granting of loans via their platform, CSPs will also be allowed to provide individual portfolio management services in relation to loans. To that end, they will be allowed to allocate a pre-determined amount of funds of an investor to one or more crowdfunding projects marketed on their platform, in accordance with an individual mandate given by the investor.  Bearing in mind the ever increasing deployment of innovative technologies in the financial sector, the EU legislator has stipulated explicitly that the use of auto-investing tools by crowdfunding platforms that enable automatic allocation of investors' funds in different projects is deemed to be the individual portfolio management of loans within the meaning of the ECSPR.  Authorisation  Legal entities that provide crowdfunding services within the meaning of the ECSPR will need to obtain authorisation from the national competent authority (NCA) in their Member State of establishment. Once authorised, they will be able to provide crowdfunding services across the EU on a cross-border basis.  Crowdfunding platforms located outside the EU - including the ones that have found their comfort zone in (until recently) the biggest FinTech centre of the European Union, London - will either need to relocate or establish subsidiaries in the EU to obtain authorisation in accordance with the new rules under the ECSPR.  Apart from an EU location, the prospective CSPs will also be required to fulfil a number of operational regulatory requirements for the purposes of authorisation. These include, among others, requirements on credit risk assessments and due diligence in relation to crowdfunding offers, requirements on complaints handling and management of conflict of interest etc. Furthermore, following in the footsteps of MiFID II, the ECSPR stipulates certain investor protection requirements that CSPs will be required to comply with. These include requirements on the:  mandatory provision of a short information sheet on each crowdfunding offer, called a Key Investor Information Sheet to investors (KIIS)  content and accuracy of marketing communications and  mandatory entry knowledge test based on which the CSPs will ensure that the prospective investor can bear potential losses attached to a particular investment.  CSPs that provide portfolio management are also required to draw up a KIIS at platform level containing relevant information about fees, about the available crowdfunding projects, responsible persons within the CSP's organisation and guidance as regards the complaints handling process.  Transposition  On 10 June 2021, the German Parliament officially adopted the law that transposes the ECSPR and Directive (EU) 2020/1504 into national law.  Given that the ECSPR is a Regulation, which is directly applicable in all EU Member States without the need for national transposition, one may ask why the German legislator came up with an idea to adopt such national transposition law in the first place? The reason for this lies in the fact that several provisions of the ECSPR permit individual Member States to define certain rules at national level, enabling smoother integration of the new rules into existing regimes.  The inclusion of certain types of instruments within the scope of the ECSPR (like shares in private limited companies), national rules on the civil liability of certain persons and rules on the provision of regulated services related to crowdfunding activities are just some areas that the ECSPR does not regulate directly. Amendments of national rules are therefore necessary.  Changes to existing financial services regulation  Under existing rules in Germany, the roles of both the fundraiser and the investor in the crowdfunding structure could potentially fall under the scope of other regulated financial services.  First, the lending activity of the investor itself can (under certain conditions) constitute the regulated activity of the lending business within the meaning of the German Banking Act (KWG). On the investor side, fundraising via a crowdfunding platform can also trigger the need to be licensed for deposit-taking under the KWG.  To bridge this regulatory uncertainty, the German transposition law makes certain amendments to the KWG. Fundraisers and lenders that raise/invest funds via crowdfunding platforms authorised under the ECSPR will not be treated as lenders or deposit-takers for the purposes of those regulated activities.  Investment-based crowdfunding  Investment-based crowdfunding covers both the placement of transferable securities within the meaning of Art. 4 paragraph 1 Nr. 44 MiFID II as well as admitted instruments for crowdfunding purposes i.e. shares in private limited companies.  However, the ECSPR explicitly stipulates that its framework applies without prejudice to national laws of individual Member States that govern the transferability of such instruments e.g. by stipulating requirements for the transfer to be authenticated by a notary.  The German legislator has decided to exercise the discretionary power provided by the ECSPR to exclude shares in private limited companies from the scope of the new regime. This decision was taken because share transfers in private limited companies are subject to notarial authentication. The German legislator does not, therefore, consider them suitable instruments for crowdfunding purposes.  Civil liability  The ECSPR requires Member States to ensure that their national law imposes civil liability on natural and legal persons who prepare a KIIS (i.e. project owners) in cases where:  its information is misleading or inaccurate; or  when certain information is omitted that would be viewed negatively by investors.  The same applies to KIIS that CSPs providing individual portfolio management of loans need to prepare at platform level. In that case, civil liability will apply to the operator of the crowdfunding platform.  The German legislator has implemented this provision into national law by holding the members of the management board of a project owner (or CSP in the case of the KIIS prepared at platform level) personally liable for the accuracy and completeness of information provided in the KIIS. They will be held accountable for both intentional as well as negligent provision of inaccurate or incomplete information in the KIIS.  These provisions of the transposing law have attracted some criticism:  where other information documents (like security prospectuses) only attract civil liability where false information is proffered through acts of gross negligence, the owners of crowdfunding projects will face civil liability even when the simple negligence threshold has been crossed. It may be challenging for small companies to summarise all the relevant risks and features of the offering on only six A4 pages, which is the prescribed maximum length of the KIIS. This could represent a competitive disadvantage in comparison with other more established financing models. For example, when securities are issued, the issuers have over 300 pages within a prospectus to make full disclosures  prospective fundraisers may simply rely on established alternative finance models, commonly known in Germany as the grey capital market. They may seek to use qualified subordinated loans or issue investment products under the German Capital Investment Act. These carry a lower level of risk of personal liability for disclosure.  The market's reaction  It is fair to say that the national transposition law has attracted the widespread criticism of the FinTech industry. The onerous personal liability provisions and the exclusion of share placements in private limited companies from the scope of the framework are viewed as potential impediments to the development of the crowdfunding sector.  The Federal German Crowdfunding Association didn’t seem to be satisfied with the content of the transposition law either, calling it “the crowdfunding prevention law”.  Many believe that the exclusion of shares in private limited companies from the scope of the new regime will lead to the incorporation of fundraising SPVs in other EU jurisdictions. Project owners will still be able to place these instruments on a cross-border basis via authorised crowdfunding platforms back into Germany.  Prospective fundraisers can also be deterred from launching their crowdfunding offer from Germany because of the severe provisions on personal liability.  Nevertheless, the strong German FinTech industry based in hubs like Berlin and Munich will not fail to benefit from the new rules on crowdfunding, despite these drawbacks. The requirements on operators of crowdfunding platforms will be the same as in any other EU Member State and the importance of the German market as a source of funding across the EU will not be jeopardised by a few cumbersome legislative provisions.  Comment  The ECSPR has pioneered a level playing field for operators of crowdfunding platforms and it aims to boost the provision of crowdfunding services on a cross-border basis across the EU. Based on its provisions, it has the potential to bridge significant divergences in national regimes on crowdfunding in different Member States.  However, its practical effect on the industry remains to be seen. Answers to many questions that prospective fundraisers may need on the conditions under which they can leverage the new regime will still be found in the laws of individual Member States.  The FinTech Action Plan, the ECSPR and recently published legislative and non-legislative proposals under the Digital Finance Package prove the Commission’s strong commitment to the creation of a suitable legal and regulatory framework for the FinTech industry in the EU. In the months and years ahead, further development and detail will emerge from the framework."

Paycheck Protection Program,BankThink Community banks are getting too little credit for PPP loans,American Banker | Daily Report,American Banker,"BankThink Community banks are getting too little credit for PPP loans  The deal to buy Happy Bancshares enables Arkansas-based Home to expand into Dallas and Austin and could provide a springboard for more acquisitions in the Lone Star State.  The California bank historically lost technology industry clients as their needs became more complex. That could change now that it has hired 10 senior bankers and plans to recruit more.  The industry opposes expanded IRS reporting and other tax-related provisions that Congress would use to pay for the overhaul. But the bill could also boost funding for small businesses and affordable housing.  Changes made in the waning days of the previous administration limited the government-sponsored enterprises’ purchases of certain loan types, which drew criticism from lenders and community groups alike.

False Claims Act,"It’s up to advisers to bring down FSCS levy, says FCA director",New Model Adviser | Latest News,Citywire,"It’s up to advisers to bring down FSCS levy, says FCA director  If advisers stop giving unsuitable advice, PI premiums and the FSCS levy will go down, the FCA’s director of consumer investments has said.  The FCA can only do so much to bring down the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) levy through regulation – it is up to advisers to stop giving unsuitable advice to lower it, the FCA’s director of consumer investments Debbie Gupta has said.  Although the FCA intends to reduce the FSCS levy by 10% every year between 2025 and 2030, advisers need to take responsibility for their own actions if they want it to go down in the meantime, Gupta told Citywire New Model Adviser.  ‘There is a need to stabilise the levy over the next five years. We have to deal with historic advice first, correct that and, having stabilised it, spend the next five years building on the work we have already done,’ she told NMA.  ‘We will apply a combination of rules and regulations and, more importantly, show firms what good advice looks like. A big part of that is the work we are doing on defined benefit [DB] transfer advice.  ‘We have helped firms understand what good advice looks like through guidance tools, seminars and events, for example. Our aspiration is for less unsuitable advice in the market, which will drive the reduction in the levy over time. If firms adopt those better standards of advice and are able to address things when they go wrong, that will bring the levy down quicker and faster.’  Gupta used the same reasoning for the ailing professional indemnity (PI) insurance market.  She said the FCA recognises that firms doing the right thing are struggling to obtain adequate cover due to capacity constraints in the insurance market but added that, as PI insurers price on risk, it is also up to advisers to reduce that risk in the type of advice they give. And that includes DB transfer advice.  ‘The role of the regulator is to ensure the firms operating in this space are doing so to regulatory standards, which takes some of the risks out of the system and insurance premiums ought to reflect that.  ‘Some firms are struggling to pay the increased PI premiums and some are struggling with the exclusions on the cover insurers are prepared to provide, but there are also firms continuing to give poor quality, unsuitable DB transfer advice that are having a problem securing insurance.  ‘If firms are giving good advice, they should have no problem getting cover.’  This morning the FCA vowed to reduce the FSCS levy by 10% per year from 2025 to 2030. It will also start a review into the compensation framework after total pensions and investment claims on the lifeboat scheme hit £453m this year."
Equal Credit Opportunity Act,CFPB Sues LendUp Loans for Allegedly Violating 2016 Consent Order and Allegedly Continuing to Deceive Borrowers,JD Supra Commercial Law,JD Supra,"CFPB Sues LendUp Loans for Allegedly Violating 2016 Consent Order and Allegedly Continuing to Deceive Borrowers  The CFPB has filed a lawsuit against Oakland, CA-based online lender LendUpLoans alleging that LendUp is in violation of a 2016 Consent Order that required the lender to pay over $3.5 million in consumer redress as well as civil penalties and to cease misleading consumers with alleged false claims about the cost of loans and the benefits of repeat borrowing.  In the Complaint filed last week in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, the CFPB accuses LendUp with continuing to engage in the same illegal and deceptive marketing that was the basis of the 2016 Consent Order as well as allegedly failing to provide timely and accurate notices to consumers whose loan applications were denied. The Complaint alleges violations of the Consumer Financial Protection Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (“ECOA”) and ECOA’s implementing regulation, Regulation B. The CFPB seeks an injunction, damages or restitution to consumers, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, and the imposition of a civil money penalty.  LendUp offers consumers single-payment and installment loans, marketing itself as an alternative to payday lenders, and using the brand identity “The LendUp Ladder.” The company’s website tells consumers that the LendUp Ladder “incentivize[s] responsible actions and enable[s] borrowers to earn access to apply for larger loans at lower interest rates over time.”  The CFPB alleges that this statement is not only misleading, but patently false. Its investigation found that 140,000 repeat borrowers were charged the same or higher interest rates for loans despite working their way up the levels of the LendUp Ladder. The investigation also found that many borrowers had their access to larger loans reduced, even after reaching the highest level of the LendUp Ladder. In addition, the CFPB alleges that LendUp failed to provide timely adverse action notices on over 7,400 loan applications, and issued over 71,800 adverse action notices without accurately describing why the loan was denied, in violation of ECOA and Regulation B.  In a press release, Acting Director Dave Uejio accused LendUp of “structur[ing] its business around wholesale deception and keeping borrowers in cycles of debt,” adding that the Bureau “will not tolerate this illegal scheme or allow this company to continue preying on vulnerable consumers.”"
Freedom of Information Act,University hauled into court over Biden's hidden records,WND | U.S.,World Net Daily (WND),"University hauled into court over Biden's hidden records  By Ailan Evans Daily Caller News Foundation Attorneys representing the Daily Caller News Foundation and Judicial Watch took to court Wednesday arguing for access to records and communications about a treasure trove of documents related to President Joe Biden’s time as Senator housed at the University of Delaware. The organizations were appealing a January decision… The post University hauled into court over Biden's hidden records appeared first on WND.  Attorneys representing the Daily Caller News Foundation and Judicial Watch took to court Wednesday arguing for access to records and communications about a treasure trove of documents related to President Joe Biden’s time as Senator housed at the University of Delaware.  The organizations were appealing a January decision by the Superior Court of Delaware which denied them access under the Delaware Freedom Of Information Act (FOIA) to the gift agreement between the university and Biden when he donated his Senate records as well as communications between the university and Biden and his representatives about the release of his Senate records.  TRENDING: Christian superstar urges faithful to demand probe of Afghanistan catastrophe  The university said it will only make the documents public two years after Biden retires from public life. Oral arguments Wednesday centered on whether documents stored in publicly-funded institutions like universities could be accessed through a FOIA request.  “How the University of Delaware is storing, maintaining, processing, and releasing President Biden’s Senate records is of concern to the citizens of Delaware and all Americans,” President of Judicial Watch Tom Fitton said in a statement to the DCNF. “During today’s hearing, it seemed as though the Delaware Supreme Court is skeptical of the unusual secrecy in the handling of these records by the University.”  Bill Green, the attorney representing the DCNF and Judicial Watch, argued that documents stored in public universities are accessible via FOIA.  “Shelf space has value, utilities have value, real estate has value,” Green said Wednesday, pointing to the 4,000 cubic feet necessary to house more than 30 years worth of documents.  Green argued that the only evidence the University of Delaware submitted proving no public funds were used to house the documents are unsworn statements by university officials rather than affidavits, which he argued are insufficient. He also argued the Delaware Superior Court’s ruling unfairly shifted the burden of proof to the plaintiffs, maintaining that the university, as the custodian of the public documents, had to show that public funds were not used to house Biden’s records.  “The University of Delaware’s argument that a public university housing public records is not subject to public disclosure requirements would be comical if all this weren’t so serious,” Daily Caller News Foundation President Neil Patel said in a statement. “We are hopeful that the court will not allow this attempt to hide President Biden’s rightfully public information to stand.”  Bill Manning, the attorney representing the University of Delaware, argued Wednesday that whether or not state funds were used to house the documents is irrelevant. He maintained that if all documents housed at state expense were accessible under FOIA, that would mean that any and all documents housed in publicly-funded universities could be accessed by the public.  The records may contain information related to Tara Reade, a woman who accused Biden of sexually assaulting her in 1993. Reade said that information related to the incident could be stored at the university.  The DCNF and Judicial Watch had each filed FOIA requests for the records in April 2020, arguing that the records should be publicly available as their housing was paid for with public funds. The university denied the request, stating that “[t]here have been no expenditures of public funds regarding or related to the Joseph R. Biden, Jr. Senatorial papers.”  Both the DCNF and Judicial Watch filed petitions in Delaware’s Office of the Attorney General to determine whether the university’s decision violated FOIA, but the attorney general denied both petitions, siding with the university’s position that the records were not related to the expenditure of state funds.  The organizations then filed a joint appeal of the attorney general’s decision, arguing that the housing of Biden’s Senate records at the University of Delaware must have been paid for by public funds and pointing out that the university receives roughly $120 million in state funds each year. However, the ruling was upheld by the Superior Court of Delaware in January."
Freedom of Information Act,South Hill ordered to produce documents; appeals filed,The News & Record | News,The News & Record,"South Hill ordered to produce documents; appeals filed  The Town of South Hill must grant Richmond attorney Richard Hawkins access to certain documents that he first asked for over two years ago.  In June, Circuit Judge J. William Watson Jr. ruled that the Town must turn over two sets of documents identified in his order as “the undated, unsigned, typed document identified on p. 9 of the Town’s log of Documents withheld” and “the undated petition identified on p. 8 of the Town’s log of Documents withheld.”  Five other documents: a “2/27/2019 letter identified on p. 7 of the Town’s Log of Documents Withheld, 8/11/2019 email identified on p. 9 of the Town’s Log of Documents Withheld, 8/22/2019 letter identified on p. 10 of the Town’s Log of Documents Withheld, 10/3/2019 resignation letter identified on p. 10 of the Town’s Log of Documents Withheld, [and] 12/2/2019 resignation letter with enclosures identified on p. 10 of the Town’s Log of Documents Withheld were found to be exempt from disclosure under Virginia’s Freedom of Information Act.  The specific contents of the seven documents sought by Hawkins are not described in the final order issued by Watson. In a lawsuit filed in January 2020, Hawkins wrote that he was seeking “among other things … all complaints from citizens or third parties about [South Hill Town Manager] Kim Callis that have been sent to or received by (i) any member of the Town Council, (ii) directly to Mr. Callis, or (iii) anyone else in the Town government from September 2018 to present.”  In a follow-up request Hawkins also asked for “internal complaints” filed against or about Callis and “copies of the resignation letters submitted by three high level town employees” — former Finance Director Catherine Bigelow, former Public Works Director Bill Wilson, and former Human Resources Manager Karen Lambert.  The decision has been appealed to the Virginia Supreme Court after both lawyers objected to the final order. Hawkins balked at the court’s decision to withhold the release of all documents sought, to award attorney’s fees and to deem him the prevailing party under the Virginia Freedom of Information Act.  Attorney Melissa York, representing the Town of South Hill, took exception to the finding that two of the seven documents withheld by the Town Office were not deemed exempt under Virginia’s Freedom of Information Act.  The final order allows the Town to avoid releasing the non-exempt documents while the appeal is pending. So far, no date has been set to hear the appeal.  When asked about the FOIA dispute, Callis said, “As this is a pending legal matter we cannot comment. The issues are being addressed by the Town’s legal counsel.” Callis would not even confirm that the Town had appealed the decision.  He also did not respond to questions about whether South Hill Town Council would make any changes to town policy and procedures related to FOIA requests following Watson’s final order. He also did not say when or if Watson’s decision had been discussed with members of Town Council, or Council’s policy committee.  When asked directly whether they would investigate how the Town handles FOIA requests, Delores Luster, head of the policy committee said, “While I understand that you are simply performing your due diligence as a journalist, the matter that you refer to is currently in litigation. As such, it is completely inappropriate for me to make a comment at the present time.”  Policy committee member Joseph Taylor offered a similar response, saying, “Richard Hawkins, III v. Town of South Hill is now pending before the Virginia Supreme Court upon Mr. Hawkins’ appeal of the Mecklenburg Circuit Court ruling. Therefore, as a member of Town Council and the Policy Committee, it is not appropriate for me to comment at this time due to pending litigation.”  Shep Moss, the third member of the policy committee, also declined comment. “I appreciate you reaching out to me. At this time no information about this matter has been shared with me as a member of Council, so I cannot comment,” Moss said.  Hawkins alleged in his complaint filed in Mecklenburg County Circuit Court in January 2020 that his Freedom of Information Act request for documents from the Town of South Hill began after three high-level town employees resigned their posts in 2019.  According to Hawkins’ complaint, “two of them reported directly to the Town’s Manager, Mr. Kim Callis, and the third had difficulties with him.”  Hawkins alleged that his concerns about town operations and the conduct of Callis was amplified in August 2019 when Callis “sent out a memorandum perhaps best described as a ‘gag order’ to the Town’s supervisory personnel telling them not to discuss ‘town employee and employment matters’ with either the Mayor or the Town Council members and if they had any problems, they should address them directly to him.”  Around this same period, Council member Ben Taylor attempted to censure South Hill Mayor Dean Marion for holding ongoing discussions with town employees regarding personnel matters.  The motion failed on a vote of 5-3 with Taylor, and former council members Glenn Allen and Millie Bracey voting in favor of the censure. A Council majority consisting of late Vice Mayor Leroy Sasser, former council member Lisa Jordan, and current members Delores Luster, Mike Moody and Lillie Feggins-Boone quashed the censure attempt.  Hawkins first request for 17 categories of documents was sent to the town via email on Sept. 9, 2019.  Two weeks later, the Town Office responded by claiming it did not “have any responsive documents.” Hawkins, in his complaint wrote that he “did not believe the town’s assertion was accurate.”  On Oct. 15, 2019, he sent a follow-up letter.  The Town responded to the second request by providing some documents, but Hawkins believed it was still withholding responsive information. On Nov. 26, 2019, he sent a third request. With this request he included the provision of Virginia’s Freedom of Information Act that obligates public bodies to liberally construe the law so as not to “withhold a public record in its entirety on the grounds that some portion of the public record is excluded from disclosure.”  He also asked for “a list of items” the town was seeking to withhold “rather than simply a statement invoking an exclusion.”  When the town, on Dec. 5, 2019, responded telling Hawkins that it “was fully compliant with the FOIA” and was withholding “27 pages of otherwise responsive documents” that were exempt from production under the law, Hawkins made one last written request to obtain the information he was seeking.  When that request was denied by the town, he filed a petition for mandamus in the Mecklenburg County Circuit Court. His petition, filed on Jan. 30, 2020, asked the court to order South Hill to turn over all requested documents, assess civil penalties against the town and order South Hill to pay the attorney’s fees and associated costs related to the lawsuit.  The response filed by attorney Melissa York on behalf of the town argues that the “Town properly responded [to Hawkins’] VFOIA requests” by delivering 153 pages of documents on Sept. 23, 2019, an additional 95 pages on Oct. 25, 2019, and another 52 pages of documents on Jan. 10, 2020.  York’s response also alleged that Hawkins “filed this Petition for Mandamus based solely on his subjective belief that the Town has improperly withheld as exempt documents responsive to his VFOIA requests.”  She further explained the reason for withholding 27 pages of responsive documents saying they were exempt from disclosure because they contained “only personnel information, “only information subject to the attorney client privilege” or were otherwise “not responsive to the requests.” Specifically, York argued that any complaints about Callis regardless of who made them, should be considered part of Callis’ personnel file, and exempt from public disclosure.  The preamble of Virginia’s Virginia Freedom of Information Act states that “the General Assembly ensures the people of the Commonwealth ready access to public records in the custody of a public body or its officers and employees. Unless a public body or its officers or employees specifically elect to exercise an exemption provided by this chapter or any other statute, every meeting shall be open to the public and all public records shall be available for inspection and copying upon request.”  The preamble continues, “The provisions of this chapter shall be liberally construed to promote an increased awareness by all persons of governmental activities and afford every opportunity to citizens to witness the operations of government. Any exemption from public access to records or meetings shall be narrowly construed and no record shall be withheld, or meeting closed to the public unless specifically made exempt pursuant to this chapter or other specific provision of law.”  Virginia’s law contains 150 specific exemptions that, when invoked, allow a public body to deny, in whole or part, any person’s request for copies of documents. The law also requires the body withholding any document state “with reasonable particularity” the basis for refusing to make public any document and “cite, as to each category of withheld records, the specific Code section that authorizes the withholding of the records.”  Tell-a-Friend | Submit a Comment  233"
US Securities & Exchange Commission,SEC Gives Whistle-Blower $110 Million in Second-Biggest Payout,Yahoo! Finance | Biotechnology Industry News,Yahoo! Finance,"SEC Gives Whistle-Blower $110 Million in Second-Biggest Payout  (Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission awarded $110 million to a tipster whose information resulted in enforcement actions, bringing total payments under the agency’s whistle-blower program to more than $1 billion.  The tipster’s award, the second-largest ever, includes $40 million from the SEC and $70 million from a related action brought by another agency, according to a statement Wednesday. Under the SEC’s whistle-blower program, tipsters can be paid for information that prompts sanctions by another agency.  “Today’s announcement underscores the important role that whistle-blowers play in helping the SEC detect, investigate and prosecute potential violations of the securities laws,” SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in the statement. “The assistance that whistle-blowers provide is crucial to the SEC’s ability to enforce the rules of the road for our capital markets.”  The SEC has made disbursements to 207 tipsters since issuing its first award in 2012. Individuals are eligible for payments ranging from 10% to 30% of the fines collected in enforcement cases where penalties exceed $1 million. Funds used to pay tipsters don’t come out of disgorgement, the portion of a sanction that’s supposed to be returned to harmed investors.  Neither the whistle-blowers nor the firms accused of misconduct were identified by the SEC, in keeping with the federal government’s policy of withholding information that could reveal a tipster’s identity.  The biggest award given to a whistle-blower was $114 million in October 2020.

Appeal from the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida ________________________ (September 15, 2021) Before MARTIN, ROSENBAUM, and LUCK, Circuit Judges. ROSENBAUM, Circuit Judge: USCA11 Case: 20-13715 Date Filed: 09/15/2021 Page: 2 of 78 We’ve probably all read stories about a few fortunate food servers collecting incredibly generous tips. 1 While that, of course, is not the norm, 2 even the best servers with the most magnanimous customers cannot earn tips during the periods their employers require them to engage in non-tipped work. So the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. §§ 201, et seq. (“FLSA”), and the regulations the Department of Labor has promulgated to effectuate it impose rules to ensure that tipped employees—who receive sub-minimum hourly wages with the expectation that tips will be high enough to bring their hourly rates to at least the minimum wage—spend the bulk of their time working in tip-producing tasks. Plaintiff-Appellant Lindsay Rafferty, who worked as a server at a Denny’s restaurant, contends that Defendant-Appellee Denny’s, Inc., failed to comply with these rules. Instead, Rafferty claims, Denny’s required her to spend much of her time performing untipped duties related to her tipped work and untipped duties that had nothing to do with her tipped work. As a result, she asserts, Denny’s paid her the sub-minimum hourly wage for time she worked in non-tip-producing tasks as well as in her tipped occupation. Rafferty also claims that Denny’s violated the 1 See, e.g., Jill Harness, 9 Amazing Tipping Stories, Mental Floss (April 10, 2019), https:// www.mentalfloss.com/article/50592/9-absolutely-amazing-tipping-stories. 2 See, e.g., Dan Sweeney, Servers share their worst tipping tales, from 3 percent on a $600 tab to Huggies coupons, The Sun-Sentinel (Aug. 10, 2018), https://www.sun-sentinel.com/ news/sound-off-south-florida/fl-reg-tipping-follow-20180810-story.html. 2 USCA11 Case: 20-13715 Date Filed: 09/15/2021 Page: 3 of 78 FLSA by failing to provide the FLSA-required notification to her of the tip rules. Denny’s moved for and prevailed on summary judgment on all counts. After careful consideration and with the benefit of oral argument, we now conclude that genuine issues of material fact concerning Rafferty’s non-tipped labor claims preclude the entry of summary judgment. But we agree with the district court that Denny’s was entitled to summary judgment on Rafferty’s FLSA notice claims. We therefore affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings. I. A. Factual Background Lindsey Rafferty joined the Denny’s team as a server at one of its Akron, Ohio, locations in February 2012. Besides waiting on tables, Rafferty also had to perform some other tasks for her job. When she spent time on these other duties, Rafferty did not interact with customers and could not earn a tip. Denny’s required Rafferty to engage in these non-tipped duties before, during, and after every shift worked.3 Rafferty’s untipped duties that, according to Rafferty, were related to her occupation as a server consisted of cutting all salad-bar items and filling and 3 Because we are reviewing an order on a motion for summary judgment, we recite the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party—here, Rafferty. See Schumann v. Collier Anesthesia, P.A., 803 F.3d 1199, 1207 (11th Cir. 2015). The actual facts may or may not be as alleged. 3 USCA11 Case: 20-13715 Date Filed: 09/15/2021 Page: 4 of 78 refilling the salad bar; stocking all premade dressings; slicing fruits; emptying, cleaning, and refilling all flavored syrup containers; cleaning throughout the front of the restaurant; cleaning, filling, and refilling the server line; cleaning and stocking the drink stations; and rolling silverware by hand into individual place settings. During any given shift, Rafferty testified, she spent between “30 and 50 percent of the time” doing these tasks. Denny’s also required Rafferty to engage in various duties that Rafferty viewed as unrelated to her occupation of serving customers. These included preparing all side and entrée salads and other food items in the back of the restaurant; greeting and seating customers; answering phones and working the cash register; bussing tables; preparing and plating desserts; handling takeout and delivery orders over the phone and from walk-in customers; managing and fulfilling orders from food delivery apps, including Uber Eats, Grubhub, and DoorDash; sweeping and mopping; wiping down the microwave and stoves; cleaning and wiping counters; washing and scrubbing walls; breaking down and cleaning the soda, juice, and coffee machines; wiping down blinds and light fixtures; cleaning chairs; cleaning and scrubbing refrigerators, the ice-cream freezer, sinks, trays, and bins; emptying, washing, and refilling all salt, pepper, syrup, and condiment dispensers, and sugar caddies; detail cleaning the salad bar; and detail cleaning the expeditor line. 4 USCA11 Case: 20-13715 Date Filed: 09/15/2021 Page: 5 of 78 Throughout Rafferty’s time working as a server for Denny’s, Denny’s paid Rafferty as a “tipped employee” under the FLSA.4 That means Denny’s paid her at a rate below the minimum wage, with the expectation that she would make up the rest of her wage rate (at least to the minimum wage) through tips. Denny’s claimed a “tip credit” for the amount between what it paid her and the minimum wage. See 29 U.S.C. § 203(m)(2)(A). Rafferty was required to accurately report all cash tips she received during each shift when she clocked out. If, in any given workweek, a tipped employee reported less in tips than necessary to make up the difference between her wage rate and the minimum wage, Denny’s claimed it automatically paid the difference. But Rafferty asserts that Denny’s paid her less than the minimum wage and claimed a tip credit on all hours worked, regardless of whether she served customers or engaged in non-tip-producing work. She left her job with Denny’s in October 2018. B. Procedural Background Not that long afterwards, Rafferty sued Denny’s in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. She alleged violations of the FLSA and sought to bring claims on behalf of herself and all similarly situated tipped employees who were subject to Denny’s alleged policy or practice of paying these 4 The FLSA defines a “tipped employee” as “any employee engaged in an occupation in which he customarily and regularly receives more than $30 a month in tips.” 29 U.S.C. § 203(t). 5 USCA11 Case: 20-13715 Date Filed: 09/15/2021 Page: 6 of 78 employees sub-minimum hourly wages in violation of the tip-credit provisions of the FLSA. Though six more plaintiffs opted into this collective action over the course of the district-court proceedings, the district court found them not to be similarly situated to Rafferty. So it ultimately dismissed them without prejudice, leaving Rafferty as the sole remaining plaintiff. Rafferty’s complaint alleged three counts under the FLSA. In Count One, Rafferty asserted that Denny’s had failed to provide its employees with appropriate notice of the tip credit it claimed under the FLSA. Count Two contended that Denny’s took the tip credit for employees’ time when they were required to engage in untipped duties unrelated to their occupation as servers. And Count Three complained that Denny’s claimed the tip credit for employees’ time even though the employees were required to work more time than permitted in non-tipped socalled related duties. Denny’s moved for summary judgment on all counts, and the district court granted Denny’s motion. As to Count One, the district court found “no genuine issue of material fact regarding Denny’s compliance with the tip credit notice requirements set forth in in 29 U.S.C. § 203(m) and 29 C.F.R. § 516.28(a)(3).” On appeal, Rafferty argues that Count One also included a second theory warranting Denny’s liability for allegedly violating the notice requirements contained in § 203(m): that Denny’s violated the FLSA by not providing updated notice each time the amount of the tip 6 USCA11 Case: 20-13715 Date Filed: 09/15/2021 Page: 7 of 78 credit changed. The district court declined to consider this argument because it concluded that Rafferty did not allege this theory in her complaint. And even if she had, the district court reasoned, Denny’s gave notice of the required information, sufficient to satisfy 29 C.F.R. § 516.28(a)(3), through its online “Workday” portal. To resolve Counts Two and Three, the district court relied on a 2018 Opinion Letter that the Department of Labor (“DOL” or “Department”) issued interpreting the dual-jobs regulation. Based on this letter, the court held that Rafferty’s claims failed because she had not provided any evidence that she had conducted “sidework” at any time that was not “contemporaneous” with her tiprelated activities. Rafferty timely appealed. II. We review de novo a district court’s grant of summary judgment and apply the same legal standards that governed the district court, viewing all evidence and drawing all reasonable inferences in the nonmoving party’s favor. Schumann v. Collier Anesthesia, P.A., 803 F.3d 1199, 1207 (11th Cir. 2015). Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(a), summary judgment is appropriate if “the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” 7 USCA11 Case: 20-13715 Date Filed: 09/15/2021 Page: 8 of 78 III. A. Material issues of fact exist concerning Rafferty’s dual-jobs-regulation claims (Counts Two and Three), so summary judgment was not appropriate Rafferty alleges in Counts Two and Three that Denny’s violated the Department’s dual-jobs regulation in two ways. In Count Two, she asserts that Denny’s took the tip credit for hours she worked on duties unrelated to her primary occupation as a server. And in Count Three, Rafferty contends that Denny’s claimed the tip credit for hours she worked excessively in untipped duties that were related to her primary job. Before we analyze these claims, in Section III.A.1, we review the applicable statutory and regulatory background because understanding them is necessary to applying the governing analytical framework. Section III.A.2 considers whether deference to the Department’s 2018 Opinion Letter’s interpretation of the dual-jobs regulation is appropriate and then construes the dual-jobs regulation. And having established in Sections III.A.1 and III.A.2 the proper analytical framework for assessing Rafferty’s dual-jobs claims, in Section III.A.3, we evaluate whether material issues of fact remain concerning Rafferty’s dual-jobs claims. 8 USCA11 Case: 20-13715 Date Filed: 09/15/2021 Page: 9 of 78 1. a. 29 U.S.C. § 203(m): the Tip-Credit Provision Congress enacted the FLSA to ensure “all able-bodied working men and women a fair day’s pay for a fair day’s work.” Watkins v. City of Montgomery, Ala., 775 F.3d 1280, 1283 (11th Cir. 2014) (citation omitted). Congress also sought “to aid the unprotected, unorganized and lowest paid of the nation’s working population; that is, those employees who lacked sufficient bargaining power to secure for themselves a minimum subsistence wage.” Schumann, 803 F.3d at 1207 (citation omitted). Towards this end, the FLSA establishes a minimum wage that covered employers may pay. See 29 U.S.C. § 206(a). But exceptions exist. See 29 U.S.C. § 206(a)(1). One of these exceptions applies to wages an employer pays a “tipped employee,” which, as we have noted, the FLSA defines as “any employee engaged in an occupation in which he customarily and regularly receives more than $30 a month in tips.” 29 U.S.C. § 203(t); see also 29 C.F.R. § 531.56. Title 29, United States Code, Section 203(m) codifies this provision.5 It authorizes an employer to pay a tipped employee less than the minimum wage, 5 Section 203(m)(2)(A) provides, in relevant part, (A) In determining the wage an employer is required to pay a tipped employee, the amount paid such employee by the employee’s employer shall be an amount equal to— 9 USCA11 Case: 20-13715 Date Filed: 09/15/2021 Page: 10 of 78 provided that the tips the employee receives at least make up for the difference between what the employer pays and the minimum wage. In addition, § 203(m) provides that it can be applied to only those tipped employees whom the employer has informed of § 203(m)(2)(A). This subsection is sometimes referred to as the “tip-credit provision” of the FLSA. Congress added the tip-credit provision to the FLSA in 1966. See Fair Labor Standards Act Amendments of 1966, Pub. L. No. 89-601, § 101, 80 Stat. 830, 830 (1966). In these same amendments, Congress authorized the Secretary of Labor “to promulgate necessary rules, regulations, or orders with regard to the amendments made by this Act.” Id. at § 603, 80 Stat. at 844. (i) the cash wage paid such employee which for purposes of such determination shall be not less than the cash wage required to be paid such an employee on August 20, 1996; and (ii) an additional amount on account of the tips received by such employee which amount is equal to the difference between the wage specified in clause (i) and the wage in effect under section 206(a)(1) of this title. The additional amount on account of tips may not exceed the value of the tips actually "
Paycheck Protection Program,"Official: Reality TV star sentenced for Ponzi scheme, fraud",Omaha World-Herald | Home,Omaha World-Herald,"Official: Reality TV star sentenced for Ponzi scheme, fraud  ATLANTA (AP) — A former cast member on the reality television show Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta has been sentenced to more than 17 years in federal prison for conspiracy and wire fraud related to a Ponzi scheme and related…  U.S. District Judge Mark H. Cohen sentenced Maurice Fayne, also known as Arkansas Mo, to 17 and a half years behind bars and five years of supervised release. Fayne, 38, of Dacula, Georgia, also was ordered to pay restitution of nearly $4.5 million to the victims.  Fayne pleaded guilty to the charges on May 11. Those also included charges of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution involving a loan application for the Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP.  “Fayne planned to use the PPP program as a cover for his long-running Ponzi scheme,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Kurt R. Erskine in a news release Wednesday. “The funds the program supplies serve as a lifeline to many businesses desperately trying to stay afloat during the pandemic, and unfortunately his fraud helped deplete those precious dollars.”  Erskine said from March 2013 through May 2020, Fayne ran a multistate Ponzi scheme that defrauded more than 20 people who invested in his trucking business. Instead of using investors' money to operate the business, he used the funds to pay personal debts and expenses and to fund an extravagant lifestyle, Erskine said.  During the scheme, Fayne spent more than $5 million at a casino in Oklahoma, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia said.  In April 2020, Fayne submitted a $3.7 million loan application to United Community Bank, falsely claiming that his trucking business had 107 employees and an average monthly payroll of $1.4 million.  Prosecutors said that instead of using the money to retain workers and other business expenses, Fayne used the loan to cover expenses including $40,000 in past-due child support, $50,000 for restitution owed in a previous fraud case, $85,000 for custom-made jewelry, $136,000 to lease a Rolls-Royce and $907,000 to start a new business in Arkansas.  Fayne appeared on season 8 of VH1’s Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta as the love interest of longtime cast member Karlie Redd."
Paycheck Protection Program,"Low unemployment, largest workforce to date",Community Impact | Kyle,Community Impact Newspaper,"Low unemployment, largest workforce to date  Unemployment has come down to 4.4% in July from a high of 12.3% in April 2020, and the amount of people in the labor force has grown beyond even pre-pandemic levels.  Trends in employment and unemployment in Hays County show the labor pool growing and expanding past 2020 lows, but not keeping pace with job postings.  Unemployment has come down to 4.4% in July from a high of 12.3% in April 2020, and the amount of people in the labor force has grown beyond even pre-pandemic levels.  Workforce Solutions Rural Capital Area, an organization that provides job seekers with training and recruitment services to employers in the nine counties that surround Austin, reports that the labor pool in Hays County has swollen to 126,017 workers, up from 121,435 last year. In April 2020 the labor market fell to 115,020 from a high of 124,113 in February. In the nine-county area, the total workforce has grown to nearly 600,000, and as of July the average unemployment rate was 4.3%.  “It’s really interesting to me when we look at the civilian labor force, if you look at where we were in February 2018 to February of 2020, we grew by about 9,000 people,” Workforce Solutions CEO Paul Fletcher said. “The whole labor force grew. And then in April of 2020 because of COVID[-19] we were down to about where we were back in February of 2018. And then in July, just two months ago, we read 126,000. So we’ve really rebounded,” he said.  Yet recent lower unemployment numbers have not translated into the same pre-pandemic labor market. Many businesses, especially in the service sector, have shuttered, and many workers have found an opportunity to jump careers, get new training or be more selective in where they work.  “We were in such a low unemployment scenario before COVID[-19] hit that if you wanted a job, you had a job, and we’re kind of back in the same place again now if you want a job, you can get a job,” Fletcher said. “But people have been able to be a lot more selective about where they go to work. They’re looking for higher pay and better hours.”  Competing for employees  At a normal fall job fair for students at Texas State University in San Marcos it is common to see a turnout of around 400-500 job seekers, but the most recent fair on Aug. 31 saw an estimated 1,500 people, said Ray Rogers, director of career services for TXST. He said the high turnout was not just students, but also employers eager to fill jobs.  “We’ve seen employers want to hire our students in pretty high numbers. We’ve had a lot of employer engagement, and a lot of requests from employers to come on campus and attend our job fairs,” Rogers said. “Our job postings have been pretty high that we receive, just from employers wanting to post on our job posting system for students and alumni.”  Rogers said that even for part-time student work, job seekers are seeing incentives such as higher hourly pay then they would make on campus and sign on bonuses. What is surprising is that with the influx of students back on campus and looking for work, more employers than they usually see—some that have not tried to recruit student workers before—are eagerly offering incentives and higher wages, he said.  “The student employment that we see here on campus or off campus, it cannot meet the demand right now that our employers have, and as a result employers are starting to pay quite a bit,” he said. “I just saw a job posting come in from Dairy Queen for $14 an hour, which is a great salary for a student, coming in working a part time job for 20 to 15 hours a week.”  What is happening right now in San Marcos with student employment is like having two freshman classes move to town, he said, because last year’s freshman class was remote learning, so now freshman and sophomores are trying to find work for the first time.  “It’s not just 6,500 students, you know, we have 12,000-13,000 students who are in that first time, on-campus experience,” Rogers said.  An increase in wages has been both a recruitment and retention tool in the hospitality industry.  Kyle Mylius, founder of The Root Cellar Cafe in San Marcos that is part of a restaurant group that includes Rhea’s Ice Cream, The Coffee Bar and Tin Top Burgers, said the businesses that managed to survive lockdowns and to-go ordering only have had to adapt to a workforce no longer willing to work for historically low wages. “When we were shut down, and we were shut down for longer than most of the restaurants in the market, we lost a lot of people,” Mylius said. “I think what the industry has had to do is increase their pay. We’ve done that as well. We’re working on other things that we’ve wanted to do for several years, and we’re in the final stages of being able to try to provide benefits for our employees.”  It is not just the hospitality industry that has struggled with employment retention. Hospital staff, especially nurses, are in demand more than ever. While nursing is always an in-demand job, stress from working in hospitals with nearly every bed filled with patients during the recent Delta-variant COVID surge has created a situation where many seasoned professionals are leaving for other work.  In a joint statement from Ascension Seton and Baylor Scott & White Health, the hospital groups emphasized that they continue to face ongoing staffing shortages and are actively recruiting for open positions.  “This latest COVID-19 spike is putting extraordinary pressure on our hospitals, emergency departments and healthcare professionals,” the statement reads.  “Given the recent surge in hospitalizations affecting facilities in Central Texas and throughout the state—and the statewide nursing shortage—both health care systems are sourcing staff using multiple resources, increasing shifts, paying critical staffing bonuses and redeploying non-nursing staff to assist with non-clinical tasks.”  Changing industry trends  Spencer Thomas, co-owner of the Texas Pie Co. in Kyle, said employee retention was paramount beginning in March of 2020. “We limited our hours and we broke our crew up into three different shifts, so there weren’t too many people here at the same time,” he said. Despite sales declining 40% by the end of 2020 compared to 2019, Texas Pie Co. was able to keep most of its staff because of a mix of the payroll protection program and some employees working part time, Thomas said.  “We are just now, as school has started, starting to undo that scheme of three shifts a day. ... We’re pretty much back to normal,” he said.  While Texas Pie Co. tried to stay open in a limited way, Mylius said his restaurant group remained completely closed longer than most of the restaurants in the San Marcos area before gradually implementing to-go orders only and finally reopening for dine-in customers.  It has still been daunting to get employees back, he said.  “Even with a kind of higher-end market pay, it’s still a challenge to get people back, especially more so in the kitchen and in the back of the house,” he said.  Fletcher said these trends are still mostly anecdotal and the data is not conclusive, but it is becoming clear the hospitality industry workforce is going through a huge shift, with many career workers deciding not to come back. “We are seeing people that were previously employed in the food service and hospitality industry—restaurants and hotels—not return to those occupations because those occupations were kind of the first to shut down, and the last to really restart,” he said. Many of those former employees also took the opportunity to improve their skills and move into a different industry such as manufacturing, skilled trades or health care.  “[They moved to an] occupation seemed to be a little more stable and opportunity for more upward, upward movement, and more of a career rather than a job,” he said.  The increase in total workforce has not kept up with increases in help wanted postings. Of the top 25 most postings per sector, according to Workforce Solutions data, the most postings are usually for retail sales people, and over the past year that number has gone down by only about 400 postings. In 2020, the county had a total of 2,087 job postings compared to 1,682 in 2021 through July, putting the total number of postings on pace to surpass 2020.  There are already more postings for registered nurses in Hays County than all of 2020, rising from 1,502 last year to 1,529 between January and July of 2021.  Hotel, motel and resort desk clerk job posting have completely dropped off, with 311 postings in all of last year. This year has only seen a handful of postings and the sector did not break into the top 25.  Child care remains a hurdle  For workers who are also parents, the struggle to show up to work and have any sort of child care remains difficult. Fletcher said the pandemic caused a lot of closures of child care facilities, and while his organization is seeing more reopen, the total need is not being met.  “The whole child care industry really took a big hit during COVID because they had so many children that stayed home with parents, everybody just stayed home if they could. That meant that that industry didn’t have any revenue coming in, and it’s hard to keep those businesses open without the kids coming in,” Fletcher said.  Virtual learning might continue to be a factor that could put a strain on childcare, as parents of older children rely on the school day in order to go to work.  Senate Bill 15 passed through the Texas Legislature on Sept. 1, and would provide funding for school districts to fund virtual or remote learning. The bill has yet to be signed by Gov. Greg Abbott. The bill would allow districts to mitigate spread of the Delta variant by sending students home but keeping them enrolled in virtual classrooms, and enrollment would be capped at 10%.  If classrooms continue to see viral spread and school children are sent home, SB 15 could prevent them from falling behind in their studies, but does not address the burden placed on parents and caretakers who have to keep their children at home while out sick. While many employers are beginning to offer more competitive pay, wages remain low in many sectors, making it difficult for some workers to afford child care to begin with. Texas has kept the current federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour and tip-earner wage of $2.13 an hour since 2010. Other states have adopted higher minimum wages, averaging out to $9.21 in 2021 according to the Labor Law Center. That makes child care virtually unaffordable for many families. Throughout last year, Workforce Solutions was able to provide a 25% child care subsidy for workers who apply for it through a grant from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. That funding has ended, Fletcher said, but more funding should be available in the future.  Even if that funding resumes, the cost of childcare in Texas could still prove unaffordable. According to the Economic Policy Institute, the average cost of infant care in Texas is $777 per month, and $589 per month for a four-year-old."
Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act,A Survey of State Standing Where Federal Standing Fails,Montgomery McCracken | Ahead of the Class,Montgomery McCracken,"A Survey of State Standing Where Federal Standing Fails  Every lawyer knows that in order to sue in federal court, plaintiffs must show that they are not merely raising abstract disputes, but have actually suffered concrete injuries.

Every lawyer knows that in order to sue in federal court, plaintiffs must show that they are not merely raising abstract disputes, but have actually suffered concrete injuries. As the Supreme Court has long held, that requirement is built into Article III, section 2 of the United States Constitution, which limits the federal judiciary’s power to resolving certain “Cases” and “Controversies.” See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 559-61 (1992). Without such an injury, the federal courts simply lack constitutional jurisdiction to resolve the case.  In Spokeo v. Robins, 136 S. Ct. 1540 (2016), the Supreme Court clarified that plaintiffs don’t necessarily meet this requirement merely by pointing out that a defendant violated the law. Some statutes, the Supreme Court reasoned, establish bare procedural requirements, the violation of which may not lead to an actual injury. Id. at 1550. Armed with this clarification, defendants have successfully moved to dismiss federal cases where plaintiffs’ claims rely solely on statutory violations. Kamal v. J. Crew Grp., Inc., 918 F.3d 102 (3d Cir. 2019) (dismissing claim where plaintiff alleged the defendant violated of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (“FACTA”) by printing more than the last five digits of his credit card on a receipt and no other injury). And just this past term, the Court reaffirmed Spokeo’s continued vitality in TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 141 S. Ct. 2190 (2021).  But that leaves state courts, whose jurisdiction is not defined by the U.S. Constitution and its injury-in-fact requirement. While many states still hew closely to federal standards for guidance, other states explicitly distinguish their jurisdiction from Article III constraints, announcing that their jurisdiction is broader. In the years since Spokeo, such distinctions have received and will continue to receive closer examination, as plaintiffs reorient their statute-based claims to jurisdictions with more favorable standards. Indeed, the TransUnion dissent predicted just such a migration—warning that TransUnion’s winning Article III argument may have achieved a ‘pyrrhic victory’ for just this reason. 141 S. Ct. at 2224 n.9 (Thomas, J., dissenting).  We are keeping tabs on this development, tracking states where courts have adjudicated (or refused to adjudicate) suits that do not meet federal standing principles. We tailored our initial focus to states that have considered these issues more frequently as well as our local jurisdictions. We will continue to update and expand our map to provide coverage on this burgeoning issue of the law.  State Standings: CADEILNJNYPA"
US AML Regulations,Backpage founders get mistrial because US overplayed child sex trafficking claims,Ars Technica | News,Ars Technica,"Backpage founders get mistrial because US overplayed child sex trafficking claims  US focused too heavily on child sex trafficking in case with no trafficking charges.  A federal judge yesterday declared a mistrial in the case against Backpage's founders, ruling that US prosecutors unfairly tainted the jury by focusing too heavily on claims of child sex trafficking in a trial that involved zero charges of child sex trafficking. A new trial will be held.  ""'The government, as prosecutors, are held to a higher standard,' said Judge Susan Brnovich from the bench as court opened for what was expected to be the eighth day of the trial. 'Their goal is not to win at any costs, but their goal is to win by the rules,'"" according to an Arizona Republic article.  The case against Backpage founders Michael Lacey and James Larkin, plus five Backpage executives and managers, is in US District Court for the District of Arizona. The actual charges are for conspiracy, facilitating prostitution, and money laundering. An order confirming the declaration of mistrial was filed, but Brnovich explained her reasoning orally.  US law enforcement agencies seized Backpage.com in April 2018, with the Justice Department calling it ""the Internet's leading forum for prostitution ads, including ads depicting the prostitution of children.""  Prosecutors persisted despite warnings  ""I, at the beginning of this, gave the government some leeway because child sex trafficking [and] sex trafficking are forms of prostitution,"" Brnovich said, according to a Reason article. ""Yet in the [government's] opening and with every witness thereafter, it seems, the government has abused that leeway."" The defendants will be punished if the government proves they ""knowingly facilitated prostitution... but it should be done correctly,"" she said.  After the prosecution's opening statement came ""close to causing [a] mistrial,"" the government agreed to minimize its focus on child sex trafficking, the judge reportedly said. Brnovich warned prosecutors to keep testimony focused on the charges in the 100-count indictment and ""said she wanted to tamp down on discussions of child sex trafficking and murders of people who had advertised on Backpage, knowing such testimony would inflame the jury,"" the Arizona Republic wrote. But one prosecution witness, a physician who works with sex trafficking victims, ""emphasized child sex trafficking above everything else,"" Brnovich said.   ""Brnovich said such testimony was allowable only if it involved evidence that Backpage executives and employees knew about it,"" according to the Arizona Republic. The article continued:  Similarly, Brnovich said that testimony given by Jessika Svendgard, who discussed being sold as a teen on Backpage, went beyond the legal boundaries she set in place. Brnovich said that despite her ruling that prosecutors stay away from day-in-the-life style testimony from any prostitutes or trafficking victims, the government's attorneys succeeded in getting Svendgard to discuss exactly that.  Svendgard told jurors, at times through tears, about being sold on Backpage by a series of pimps. ""I would be raped for money,"" she said. Brnovich said the use of that word ""raises a whole new emotional response from people.""  Brnovich said she doesn't view the prosecutors' mistakes ""as intentional misconduct,"" but ""the cumulative effect of all of that is something that I can't overlook and won't overlook."" The judge scheduled an October 5 status hearing to discuss a new trial.  Defendants sought acquittal  Yesterday's ruling came in response to a defendants' motion for acquittal or, at minimum, mistrial. The defendants contended that the ""government's opening argument was a parade of horribles about human trafficking destroying the lives of trafficked women and children, with barely any mention of charged counts and zero linkage of any defendant to any charged count."" The government ""absolutely ignored the court's admonitions"" to focus on the charges, which center on ""whether each individual defendant had specific knowledge of each charged ad and specifically intended to promote a business of prostitution by that ad,"" the motion said.  ""During two hours of improper, inflammatory argument, the government failed to allege that any defendant had knowledge of a single ad charged in the indictment, much less set forth any facts that could establish the specific intent necessary to convict on any count,"" the motion also said.  The US government's response said that the court ""issued a pretrial ruling addressing this issue, finding that '[s]ex trafficking and child sex trafficking are, by definition, both forms of prostitution,' and '[e]vidence that tends to prove that defendants were aware that Backpage.com was being used to facilitate sex trafficking and child sex trafficking are extremely probative to show notice to defendants that the website was being used for illegal purposes'—including facilitation of prostitution.""  ""Throughout the last three years of intense pretrial litigation, defendants never seriously addressed any evidence concerning their prostitution-marketing strategies,"" the US argued. ""In the instant motion, defendants studiously avoid discussing this evidence. Rather, defendants continue to take the exceedingly narrow view that they can only be liable if they had specific knowledge of each individual ad."""
HIPAA - Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act,Douglas County reps level accusations at Tri-County Health,Centennial Citizen | Letters to the editor,Centennial Citizen,"Ellis Arnold  Douglas County reps level accusations at Tri-County Health  Kevin Bracken, Douglas County's newest representative on the Tri-County Health Department board — a longtime critic of the agency — has asked it to investigate what he alleges was “illegal” activity regarding the video recording of the board's Aug. 30 meeting.  And another Douglas County representative to the board, Linda Fielding, accused fellow board members of being ""compromised"" at the meeting.  The Aug. 30 meeting saw contentious exchanges between Tri-County officials leading up to the agency's decision to require mask wearing by everyone inside schools as a COVID-19 safety measure and to repeal the ability of counties to opt out of its public health orders.  Those actions have met with stout opposition from Douglas County's elected commissioners, who are taking steps to pull the county out of its 55-year-old relationship with Tri-County, the public-health agency for Douglas, Adams and Arapahoe counties. The Douglas County School District is enforcing the mask rule, however.  Kevin Bracken emailed his accusations to other Tri-County board members, along with elected leaders in the three counties. The email was forwarded to Colorado Community Media by Douglas County Commissioner George Teal.  In his email, Bracken referred to his comments at the Aug. 30 meeting.  “I just want it noted that the (video of the) Aug. 30 meeting had a very concerning fast forward through several of the board members' comments. (Comments of) mine and Dr. Fielding in particular were (affected) more than any other board members,” Bracken said during the Board of Health's Sept. 9 meeting.  Bracken added: “I find it very concerning if this file was edited.”  'Was it intentional or not?'  Ronnae Brockman, the Tri-County executive assistant who helps run health board meetings, criticized Bracken's comments and called them “false claims.”  “If you continue to engage in this hostile and defamatory behavior, I will take legal action against you,” Brockman told Bracken.  Bracken responded that he never alleged that Brockman, specifically, edited the video.  Brockman said that because of her position, when Bracken says a video was edited, “that is defamatory to me.”  “There is a difference between saying, 'Hey, you guys, I noticed this is something happened on your video,'” Brockman said. “It's very different than your accusatory email.”  Board President Kaia Gallagher, an Arapahoe County representative, acknowledged there was disruption in the video, saying: “The question really is, was it intentional or not?”  Gallagher said a disruption in recording has occurred before.  “To the extent possible, the Tri-County Health Department staff will look into it,” Gallagher said. Bracken said the Aug. 30 video is the only file that has been fast-forwarded through “in the recordings I've had an opportunity to watch.”  Jan Brainard, another Board of Health member from Arapahoe County, said she remembers that “after the very first Zoom meeting,” referring to a video-conferencing service used to conduct meetings remotely, she noticed a problem with the video recording.  “I called or sent an email to Ronnae (Brockman) and asked her where I could find it, and it was the exact same thing. There were parts of it missing,” Brainard said.  She added: “My point being that this is not intentional. It was not directed at Mr. Bracken.”  Bracken appears to be correct that his comments at the Aug. 30 meeting were affected by the disruption more than other board members' comments in the period that runs from roughly 49:00 to 1:12:00 in the recording (available online at tinyurl.com/TriCountyAug30Video), when much of the board discussion took place.  But many comments from John Douglas, executive director of Tri-County Health, were also disrupted, including comments from Douglas that appeared not to be in response to Bracken. Not all of Bracken's comments were disrupted.  Claims of members 'compromised'  What could be called the most controversial part of the meeting discussion is still almost entirely intact on the recording. That's when Fielding references Colorado statute 18-8-306, a state law that prohibits coercion of public officials. The law bars “attempts to influence any public servant.”  “I have information directly about one case, and there may be other cases that I suspect, and this is concerning board members who have been basically compromised because they have had complaints filed against them,” Fielding said during the Aug. 30 meeting.  During the meeting, Fielding called the meeting itself “compromised” and said it should be canceled “until we can resolve the status of those board members.”  It wasn't clear from her comments which board members Fielding was referring to or where complaints were allegedly filed, and she did not offer evidence to back her claims of coercion. Colorado Community Media reached out to Fielding with questions about the allegations, but she did not respond.  Asked about Fielding's claims, Becky O'Guin, spokesperson for Tri-County Health, said on Sept. 1: “We ... do not have information on what Dr. Fielding mentioned during the meeting. Any legal issues would be taken up in executive session with the Board of Health and (its) legal counsel,” An executive session is a closed-door meeting, often held to discuss legal questions.  HIPAA a factor, Tri-County says  During the Sept. 9 Board of Health meeting, after Bracken raised his concerns about the Aug. 30 meeting video, Fielding suggested that Tri-County staff contact Zoom to try to improve the quality of meeting recordings and recover some of what was fast-forwarded through; Bracken seconded that motion. The board voted it down.  An email from Bracken to other board members and county officials regarding the meeting video said: “I am requesting an investigation into tampering, censorship, and this illegal activity.”  A statement from O'Guin on Sept. 10 statement said: “TCHD staff did not edit the video of the August 30th Board of Health meeting and have no control over where the videos are compressed. That this issue occurred during Mr. Bracken's and Dr. Fielding's comments is entirely coincidental. Finally, the compression issue isn't unique to the August 30th Board of Health meeting. It has occurred on recordings of other Board meetings as well as internal TCHD meetings.”  O'Guin's Sept. 10 statement noted that the meeting videos often include places where the video is “compressed” and the sentences are unintelligible, meaning they sound like they are being “fast-forwarded” through.  O'Guin pointed to recordings of Tri-County's previous three regular Board of Health meetings as examples of when the disruption occurred in the past. She noted disruption in the June 10 meeting at 45:14, in the July 8 meeting at 56:51 and 1:05:17, and in the Aug. 12 meeting at 33:07.  “We have talked to Zoom about this issue and have been told that, unless we record to the cloud, we will continue to experience these issues. Unfortunately, TCHD is prohibited from recording to the cloud by HIPAA and must record the meeting on a TCHD computer,” O'Guin's statement read. (""The cloud"" refers to the use of remote internet services rather than software on a user's own computer.)  The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, is a federal law that required the creation of national standards to protect sensitive patient health information from being disclosed without the patient's consent or knowledge, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website.  Asked how HIPAA applies to the situation, O’Guin on Sept. 13 said: ""TCHD has (an) enterprise-wide Zoom account with HIPAA-compliant features. TCHD staff use Zoom for telehealth appointments and other tasks that involve handling protected health information (PHI) on clients."" (Telehealth means the providing of health care or public-health activities remotely via telecommunications technology, such as videoconferencing.)  ""We have agency-wide HIPAA policies and procedures and through our Zoom account, staff are blocked from recording to the Zoom Cloud to reduce the potential for accidental disclosure of PHI because the Zoom Cloud is not HIPAA-compliant and not under TCHD’s control,"" O'Guin continued. ""We are looking into purchasing additional Zoom licenses that are outside of our HIPAA-compliant licenses to enable better Zoom recording quality.""  ""We are considering an alternative Zoom account that lacks HIPAA-compliant features for public meetings,"" O'Guin added.  Based on meeting length according to the official meeting minutes and the length of the recording, about 30 minutes was lost from the Aug. 30 meeting, according to O'Guin.  Zoom automatically converts recordings to an MP4 file when the meeting ends, and this file was uploaded in its entirety to Tri-County's website, O'Guin said.  “The file cannot be fixed. This is how the video was converted by Zoom. Please note that TCHD isn't required to post these recordings but did so in an effort to be transparent,” O'Guin said."

SUMMARY:  The Federal Trade Commission (“FTC” or “Commission”) is issuing a final rule (“Final Rule”) to amend its Affiliate Marketing Rule to correspond to changes made to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”) by the Dodd-Frank Act.  DATES:  This rule is effective October 18, 2021.  Start Further Info  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:  David Lincicum (202-326-2773), Division of Privacy and Identity Protection, Bureau of Consumer Protection, Federal Trade Commission, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20580.  End Further Info End Preamble Start Supplemental Information  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  I. Background  A. The Affiliate Marketing Rule  The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (“FACT Act”) was signed into law on December 4, 2003. Public Law 108-159, 117 Stat. 1952. Section 214 of the FACT Act added a new section 624 to the FCRA. This provision gives consumers the right to restrict a person from using certain information obtained from an affiliate to make solicitations to that consumer. Section 624 generally provides that if a person receives certain consumer eligibility information from an affiliate, the person may not use that information to make solicitations to the consumer about its products or services, unless the consumer is given notice and an opportunity (via a simple method) to opt out of such use of the information, and the consumer does not opt out. The statute also provides that Section 624 does not apply, for example, to a person using eligibility information: (1) To make solicitations to a consumer with whom the person has a pre-existing business relationship; (2) to perform services for another affiliate subject to certain conditions; (3) in response to a communication initiated by the consumer; or (4) to make a solicitation that has been authorized or requested by the consumer. Unlike the FCRA affiliate sharing opt-out (15 U.S.C. 1681a(d)(2)(A)(iii)) and the opt-out of sharing with non-affiliated third parties under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”), 15 U.S.C. 6801 et seq., which apply indefinitely, Section 624 provides that a consumer's affiliate marketing opt-out election must be effective for a period of at least five years. Upon expiration of the opt-out period, the consumer must be given a renewal notice and an opportunity to renew the opt-out before information received from an affiliate may be used to make solicitations to the consumer.  The Commission published regulations implementing Section 624, the Affiliate Marketing Rule, 16 CFR part 680, on October 30, 2007.[1]  B. Dodd-Frank Act  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”) was signed into law in 2010.[2]  The Dodd-Frank Act substantially changed the federal legal framework for financial services providers. Among the changes, the Dodd-Frank Act transferred to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) the Commission's rulemaking authority under portions of the FCRA.[3]  Accordingly, in 2012, the Commission rescinded several of its FCRA rules, which had been replaced by rules issued by the CFPB.[4]  The FTC retained rulemaking authority for other rules promulgated under the FCRA to the extent the rules apply to motor vehicle dealers described in section 1029(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act [5]  predominantly engaged in the sale and servicing of motor vehicles, the leasing and servicing of motor vehicles, or both (“motor vehicle dealers”).[6]  The rules for which the FTC retains rulemaking authority include the Affiliate Marketing Rule, which now applies only to motor vehicle dealers.[7]  Entities that are not motor vehicle dealers are covered by the CFPB's Regulation V, subpart C, which is substantially similar to the Commission's rule.[8]  II. Regulatory Review of the Affiliate Marketing Rule  On September 22, 2020, the Commission solicited comments on the Affiliate Marketing Rule as part of its periodic review of its rules and guides.[9]  The Commission sought information about the costs and benefits of the rule, and its regulatory and economic impact. In addition, the Commission proposed amending the rule to narrow its scope to motor vehicle dealers excluded from CFPB jurisdiction as described in the Dodd-Frank Act.[10]  The Commission received no comments.  III. Overview of Final Rule  The Commission promulgated the Affiliate Marketing Rule at a time when it had rulemaking authority for a broader group of entities. While the Dodd-Frank Act did not change the Commission's enforcement authority for the Affiliate Marketing Rule, it did narrow the Commission's rulemaking authority with respect to the rule. It now covers only motor vehicle dealers. The amendments in the Dodd-Frank Act necessitate a technical revision to the Affiliate Marketing Rule to ensure the regulation is consistent with the text of the amended FCRA. Accordingly, the Commission amends the Affiliate Marketing Rule to properly reflect the rule's scope.  The amendment to § 680.1(b) narrows the scope description of the Affiliate Marketing Rule to the entities excluded from CFPB jurisdiction as described in the Dodd-Frank Act.[11]  It does so by replacing the broad term “person” with the term “motor vehicle dealer,” as defined in amended § 680.3.  The amendment to § 680.3 adds a definition of “motor vehicle dealer” that defines motor vehicle dealers as those entities excluded from CFPB jurisdiction as described in the Dodd-Frank Act.[12]  The amendments do not change the substantive provisions of the rule or the examples in the rule, even where those provisions and examples involve entities covered by the CFPB's rule rather than the Commission's rule. The Start Printed Page 51610primary reason for retaining these provisions and examples is that the rule addresses the relationship between covered motor vehicle dealers and their affiliates, which may not be motor vehicle dealers. The obligations and exceptions set forth by the rule are inextricably linked to a consumer's relationship and actions in relation to all affiliates, both motor vehicle dealers and non-motor vehicle dealers. In order for the rule to apply meaningfully, it must address both types of entities, even those not directly covered by the rule. This will not create any conflict with the CFPB's corresponding rule, as the Commission's Affiliate Marketing Rule and the CFPB's rule are substantially similar and impose the same obligations and exceptions on entities they cover.  IV. Paperwork Reduction Act  The Affiliate Marketing Rule contains information collection requirements as defined by 5 CFR 1320.3(c), the definitional provision within the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”) regulations that implement the Paperwork Reduction Act (“PRA”). 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. OMB has approved the rule's existing information collection requirements through February 28, 2023 (OMB Control No. 3084-0131). Under the existing clearance, the FTC has attributed to itself the estimated burden regarding all motor vehicle dealers and shares equally the remaining estimated PRA burden with the CFPB for other persons for which both agencies have enforcement authority.  The Final Rule amends 16 CFR part 680. The amendments do not modify or add to information collection requirements previously approved by OMB. The amendments make no substantive changes to the rule, other than to clarify that the scope of the rule is limited to motor vehicle dealers. The rule's OMB clearance already reflects that scope. Therefore, the Commission does not believe the amendments substantially or materially modify any “collections of information” as defined by the PRA.  V. Regulatory Flexibility Act  The Regulatory Flexibility Act (“RFA”), as amended by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, requires an agency to either provide an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (“IRFA”) with a proposed rule, or certify that the proposed rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.[13]  The Commission published an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis in order to inquire into the impact of the proposed rule on small entities.[14]  The Commission received no responsive comments.  The Commission does not believe these amendments have the threshold impact on small entities. The amendments effectuate changes to the Dodd-Frank Act and will not impose costs on small motor vehicle dealers because the amendments are for clarification purposes and will not result in any increased burden on any motor vehicle dealer. Thus, a small entity that complies with current law need not take any different or additional action under the Final Rule. Therefore, the Commission certifies that amending the Affiliate Marketing Rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small businesses.  Although the Commission certifies under the RFA that the Final Rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities, and hereby provides notice of that certification to the Small Business Administration, the Commission nonetheless has determined publishing a final regulatory flexibility analysis (“FRFA”) is appropriate to ensure the impact of the rule is fully addressed. Therefore, the Commission has prepared the following analysis:  A. Need for and Objectives of the Final Rule  To address the Dodd-Frank Act's changes to the Commission's rulemaking authority, the amendments clarify that the rule applies only to motor vehicle dealers.  B. Significant Issues Raised in Public Comments in Response to the IRFA  The Commission did not receive any comments that addressed the burden on small entities. In addition, the Commission did not receive any comments filed by the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration (“SBA”).  C. Estimate of Number of Small Entities to Which the Final Rule Will Apply  The Commission anticipates many covered motor vehicle dealers may qualify as small businesses according to the applicable SBA size standards. As explained in the IRFA, however, determining a precise estimate of the number of small entities is not readily feasible. No commenters addressed this issue. Nonetheless, as discussed above, these amendments do not add any additional burdens on any covered small businesses.  D. Projected Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other Compliance Requirements, Including Classes of Covered Small Entities and Professional Skills Needed To Comply  The amendments impose no new reporting, recordkeeping, or other compliance requirements.  E. Description of Steps Taken To Minimize Significant Economic Impact, if any, on Small Entities, Including Alternatives  The Commission did not propose any specific small entity exemption or other significant alternatives because the amendments will not increase reporting requirements and will not impose any new requirements or compliance costs.  VI. Other Matters  Pursuant to the Congressional Review Act (5 U.S.C. 801 et seq.), the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs designated this rule as not a “major rule,” as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2).

US AML Regulations,Cryptocurrency: Rise of decentralized finance sparks 'dirty money' fears Regulators fear new blockchain technologies will make it easier for criminals and kleptocrats to move money around the global financial system,Financial Post | News Alerts,Financial Post,"Cryptocurrency: Rise of decentralized finance sparks 'dirty money' fears Regulators fear new blockchain technologies will make it easier for criminals and kleptocrats to move money around the global financial system  Article content  ShapeShift, as the enterprise is known, would become a “decentralized autonomous organization,” or DAO, over time, he declared. Its corporate structure would fade away. Control of its open-source software for exchanging cryptocurrencies would “gradually migrate” to holders of ShapeShift’s FOX digital token, which had been distributed to employees, investors and customers. Voorhees will receive the biggest share, a little more than 5 per cent of the maximum total supply, he added.  “ShapeShift’s vision is the establishment of an immutable, borderless financial system,” Voorhees wrote on Twitter, where he has nearly 525,000 followers. “Let’s be direct: money and finance shall not be operated by coercive government among free people. They shall — like language, mathematics, and love — emerge voluntarily and without central rule.”  Voorhees’s July 14 proclamation has since become a hot topic of conversation in U.S. regulatory circles, where it has been seen by some officials as heralding a new phase in the battle to prevent money laundering on blockchains — the digital ledgers of cryptocurrency transactions.  Regulators have long worried that the secrecy of the crypto trade — in which coins are controlled by the holder of a “private key,” a form of cryptographical password — creates opportunities to disguise the origin and ownership of funds. Now, they fear that new blockchain technologies will make it easier for criminals and kleptocrats — who are believed to launder hundreds of billions of dollars a year — to move money around the global financial system.  These anxieties are being fuelled by the growth of what has become known as decentralized finance or DeFi — a business with assets now measured in the tens of billions of dollars. Operating under names like Uniswap, Sushiswap and Pancakeswap, DeFi platforms seek to replace financial intermediaries such as banks or brokers with software known as smart contracts, commonly run on the Ethereum blockchain, that would automate market activity. Although their legal status is hazy and their structures vary, DAOs are a way to put control of DeFi platforms into the hands of a community of stakeholders, often entrusted with governance tokens granting voting rights, rather than a centralised company.  Article content  The appeal of DeFi platforms is that they would lower costs and speed up trading, using digital assets. The worry among regulators is they would replace the very entities that governments turn to for help in enforcing the laws against money laundering — bankers, brokers and money transmitters that stand between people and markets.  Of particular concern is the fate of a key pillar of the anti-money laundering regime — the requirement on financial companies to “know your customer.” The KYC obligation means intermediaries are supposed to know their users’ names, monitor their transactions and report activities that raise money-laundering suspicions to the authorities.  Voorhees and his crypto allies have never really wanted to know their customers — and they now believe that DeFi innovations of recent months will enable them to break free of such obligations. As a company, ShapeShift gave in to regulatory pressure in 2018 and began to collect user details. As a DAO, ShapeShift no longer sees a requirement to do KYC checks, it says.  Article content  “The company is not providing any regulated services,” said Veronica McGregor, its spokesperson, in a statement. “At present, there are no official regulators of DAOs. ShapeShift is not an exchange, is not a financial intermediary and is not holding custody of any funds. It’s simply an open-source interface for users to interact with their own digital assets.”  The most likely result of these developments will be legal conflict, industry executives say. On one side of the battle are software developers — motivated by both libertarian ideals and commercial considerations — who are looking to turn the financial services industry on its head. On the other are regulators wondering what is going to be left to regulate in the years to come.  Article content  “DeFi is using loopholes in regulation because they don’t actually hold the customer’s money, unlike a broker,” says David Jevans, chief executive of CipherTrace, a cryptocurrency intelligence company started in 2015 with funding from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to help prevent financial crime. “This has allowed a nice wave of innovation, which is great. But it also allows a wave of innovation by people trying to launder money through the system.”  The question facing U.S. officials is “how does a person who writes some software get regulated” by the Treasury or the Securities and Exchange Commission, he adds, estimating it could take two years for the resulting legal challenges to unfold. “We will see how it shakes out.”  Article content  ‘The most private payment system’  Money launderers do not need cryptocurrencies to be successful. Most do just fine with traditional methods — such as mixing illicit funds into trade flows or ploughing them into assets such as property or art. But while the extent of money laundering in the crypto markets is difficult to calculate, the official concern is undeniable. Janet Yellen, U.S. Treasury secretary, in February described “the misuse” of cryptocurrencies as a “growing problem.” A month earlier Christine Lagarde, European Central Bank president, linked digital assets to “totally reprehensible money-laundering activity.”  “Criminals of all types are increasingly using cryptocurrency to launder their illicit proceeds,” the U.S. justice department’s cyber-digital task force said in a report last year. “Transnational criminal organizations, including drug cartels, may find cryptocurrency especially useful to hide financial activities and to move vast sums of money efficiently across borders without detection.”  Article content  A bevy of analytical firms has emerged to help detect illicit activity in the industry. But their tools are better suited to spotting crimes taking place on blockchains themselves — such as thefts, scams and ransomware payments — than in quantifying the amount of money from crimes committed elsewhere that finds its way on to crypto markets.  These watchdogs take advantage of the fact that blockchain transactions are public and gather data to identify suspicious patterns of activity or addresses. Focusing on this kind of “cryptocurrency native” crime — meaning it is “practically dependent on cryptocurrency or inherently intertwined with it” — Chainalysis, a leading crypto forensics firm, estimates illicit activity represented 0.34 per cent of cryptocurrency transaction volume in 2020, down from 2.1 per cent in 2019, as the overall level of crypto activity increased last year.  Article content  Chainalysis says it knows that bad actors such as drug traffickers “are laundering their ill-gotten funds by converting them into cryptocurrency and sending them around the world.” But it adds that it is “harder to both investigate this activity in individual cases or to size it in the aggregate” because such funds move “into cryptocurrency directly from fiat [official currencies] rather than move from known illicit addresses” on blockchains, leaving no trace of how the money was originally made.  One of the ironies of the DeFi revolution is that for all the talk about supplanting banks and brokers, the crypto industry still relies on such regulated players as the first line of defence against money laundering. These firms — with their costly anti-money laundering programs — are seen as guardians of the “on ramps” and “off ramps” connecting the fiat and cryptocurrency worlds. As in old western movies, the banks and the brokers are supposed to head off the bad guys at the pass.  Article content  “The ‘on ramps’ and the ‘off ramps’ into the blockchain, they have the traditional AML requirements,” says Michael Gronager, chief executive of Chainalysis. “So as soon as you bring in dollars into a shop, into a crypto exchange, into a broker, they are bound by the traditional rules…and they would catch that.”  Adding to the challenge for law enforcement is that some developers are working to make it harder to spot illicit activity. One example involves difficult to trace privacy coins — such as Monero, Zcash and Dash. The U.S. justice department last year called their use an example of “a high-risk activity that is indicative of possible criminal conduct.”  Jevans of CipherTrace, which is being acquired by Mastercard, says privacy coins “are designed to avoid detection” through techniques including “ring signatures, meaning multiple parties are involved in signing a transaction so it is hard to tell which one actually initiated it.” He sees “room in the crypto ecosystem for privacy coins” but only if their developers add compliance features to make it possible to discern the address from which a token comes.  Article content  “You are talking about many PhDs in computer science and mathematics and cryptography who are contributing to this project,” Jevans says. “They are not bad guys, necessarily. They just want to build the most private payment system on planet Earth and they don’t really care who uses it. I get it from an intellectual perspective. If you want to build the most private system in the world, you should go build it. But bad guys actually use that stuff.”  Preferring not to ‘know your customer’  ShapeShift’s own history highlights the allure of such private systems. When Voorhees started the cryptocurrency exchange in 2014 — the same year he agreed to pay US$50,000 to settle SEC allegations involving the sale of unregistered securities — ShapeShift did not ask customers for personal information. Voorhees, who sees KYC schemes as “unethical and dangerous,” argues that collecting that kind of data creates a “honeypot” for hackers specializing in identity theft.  Article content  By 2018, however, Voorhees said he came to fear that his exchange would be shut down if it failed to follow KYC rules and it began to seek personal information from its customers. Coupled with turbulence in crypto markets, the change in KYC policy devastated the company, forcing it to almost halve its staff from 135 people to about 70, he said in a video interview posted on ShapeShift’s website.  “It was a super-dark time,” he said in the interview. “The vast majority of our customers just went elsewhere, and I certainly can’t blame them. There were lots of other companies that weren’t nearly as worried about the regulatory system as we were at that point, and so the customers just went there…We suddenly became super unprofitable, and losing tons of money.”  Article content  The embrace of DeFi by opponents of KYC raises the possibility that the platforms are becoming the financial services equivalent of self-driving cars that can do just about everything but stop at red lights. Yet, applying the regulatory brakes could be tricky. There are questions over whether U.S. officials have the legal authority to impose anti-money laundering rules on the software developers behind such protocols.  Crypto advocates are already arguing that regulators would be violating the U.S. constitution if they try. “The writing and publishing of software is free speech under the first amendment,” says Miller Whitehouse-Levine, policy director at the DeFi Education Fund, an industry advocacy group. “How do you ask folks to change their speech essentially to comply with what the government thinks they should be doing?”  Article content  The more likely approach would be to find some corporate nub in the DeFi platforms to which legal obligations could be attached. Gary Gensler, SEC chair, hinted at such possibilities in a recent Financial Times interview in which he said DeFi platforms reminded him of the “peer-to-peer” lending businesses that developed in the earlier part of the century.  Just as there was “a company in the middle” of peer-to-peer lending, he said DeFi has “a fair amount of centralization,” including governance mechanisms, fee models and incentive systems. “A lot of the developers want to suggest that they are not [doing anything] more than developing software,” he added. “It’s a misnomer to say they [DeFi platforms] are just software that is put out to the web.”  DeFi advocates say they recognize the difficulty the authorities face in fashioning regulatory mechanisms that would work without traditional financial intermediaries. But they warn that a precipitous response could drive DeFi innovation to other countries — and they have allies in Congress who share their concerns. A furore on Capitol Hill this summer over imposing tax reporting requirements on crypto “brokers” — which remains unresolved — showed that the industry has allies on both sides of the U.S. political divide.  Article content  Ultimately, the crypto industry is asking that the DeFi platforms be given the room that they need to develop — and mature. The people who understand the platforms’ flaws well enough to fix them are the software developers who came up with the protocols in the first place, these advocates argue.  “DeFi poses all sorts of unique public policy questions. The crypto community has ideas on how to [respond],” says Kristin Smith, executive director of the Blockchain Association, an industry lobbying group. “Our ask of policymakers is, let’s take some time to learn about this.”  © 2021 The Financial Times Ltd  _____________________________________________________________  If you liked this story, sign up for more in the FP Finance newsletter.  _____________________________________________________________"

ACTION:   Final rule.   SUMMARY:   The Federal Trade   Commission (‘‘FTC’’ or ‘‘Commission’’)   is issuing a final rule (‘‘Final Rule’’) to   amend its Affiliate Marketing Rule to   correspond to changes made to the Fair   Credit Reporting Act (‘‘FCRA’’) by the   Dodd-Frank Act.   DATES:   This rule is effective October 18,   2021.   FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:   David Lincicum (202–326–2773),   Division of Privacy and Identity   Protection, Bureau of Consumer   Protection, Federal Trade Commission,   600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW,   Washington, DC 20580.   SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:   I. Background   A. The Affiliate Marketing Rule   The Fair and Accurate Credit   Transactions Act of 2003 (‘‘FACT Act’’)   was signed into law on December 4,   2003. Public Law 108–159, 117 Stat.   1952. Section 214 of the FACT Act   added a new section 624 to the FCRA.   This provision gives consumers the   right to restrict a person from using   certain information obtained from an   affiliate to make solicitations to that   consumer. Section 624 generally   provides that if a person receives certain   consumer eligibility information from   an affiliate, the person may not use that   information to make solicitations to the   consumer about its products or services,   unless the consumer is given notice and   an opportunity (via a simple method) to   opt out of such use of the information,   and the consumer does not opt out. The   statute also provides that Section 624   does not apply, for example, to a person   using eligibility information: (1) To   make solicitations to a consumer with   whom the person has a pre-existing   business relationship; (2) to perform   services for another affiliate subject to   certain conditions; (3) in response to a   communication initiated by the   consumer; or (4) to make a solicitation   that has been authorized or requested by   the consumer. Unlike the FCRA affiliate   sharing opt-out (15 U.S.C.   1681a(d)(2)(A)(iii)) and the opt-out of   sharing with non-affiliated third parties   under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act   (‘‘GLBA’’), 15 U.S.C. 6801   et seq.,   which   apply indefinitely, Section 624 provides   that a consumer’s affiliate marketing   opt-out election must be effective for a   period of at least five years. Upon   expiration of the opt-out period, the   consumer must be given a renewal   notice and an opportunity to renew the   opt-out before information received   from an affiliate may be used to make   solicitations to the consumer.   The Commission published   regulations implementing Section 624,   the Affiliate Marketing Rule, 16 CFR   part 680, on October 30, 2007.  1  B. Dodd-Frank Act   The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform   and Consumer Protection Act (‘‘Dodd-   Frank Act’’) was signed into law in   2010.  2  The Dodd-Frank Act   substantially changed the federal legal   framework for financial services   providers. Among the changes, the   Dodd-Frank Act transferred to the   Consumer Financial Protection Bureau   (‘‘CFPB’’) the Commission’s rulemaking   authority under portions of the FCRA.  3  Accordingly, in 2012, the Commission   rescinded several of its FCRA rules,   which had been replaced by rules   issued by the CFPB.  4  The FTC retained   rulemaking authority for other rules   promulgated under the FCRA to the   extent the rules apply to motor vehicle   dealers described in section 1029(a) of   the Dodd-Frank Act  5  predominantly   engaged in the sale and servicing of   motor vehicles, the leasing and   servicing of motor vehicles, or both   (‘‘motor vehicle dealers’’).  6  The rules for   which the FTC retains rulemaking   authority include the Affiliate   Marketing Rule, which now applies   only to motor vehicle dealers.  7  Entities   that are not motor vehicle dealers are   covered by the CFPB’s Regulation V,   subpart C, which is substantially similar   to the Commission’s rule.  8  II. Regulatory Review of the Affiliate   Marketing Rule   On September 22, 2020, the   Commission solicited comments on the   Affiliate Marketing Rule as part of its   periodic review of its rules and guides.  9  The Commission sought information   about the costs and benefits of the rule,   and its regulatory and economic impact.   In addition, the Commission proposed   amending the rule to narrow its scope   to motor vehicle dealers excluded from   CFPB jurisdiction as described in the   Dodd-Frank Act.  10  The Commission   received no comments.   III. Overview of Final Rule   The Commission promulgated the   Affiliate Marketing Rule at a time when   it had rulemaking authority for a   broader group of entities. While the   Dodd-Frank Act did not change the   Commission’s enforcement authority for   the Affiliate Marketing Rule, it did   narrow the Commission’s rulemaking   authority with respect to the rule. It now   covers only motor vehicle dealers. The   amendments in the Dodd-Frank Act   necessitate a technical revision to the   Affiliate Marketing Rule to ensure the   regulation is consistent with the text of   the amended FCRA. Accordingly, the   Commission amends the Affiliate   Marketing Rule to properly reflect the   rule’s scope.   The amendment to § 680.1(b) narrows   the scope description of the Affiliate   Marketing Rule to the entities excluded   from CFPB jurisdiction as described in   the Dodd-Frank Act.  11  It does so by   replacing the broad term ‘‘person’’ with   the term ‘‘motor vehicle dealer,’’ as   defined in amended § 680.3.   The amendment to § 680.3 adds a   definition of ‘‘motor vehicle dealer’’ that   defines motor vehicle dealers as those   entities excluded from CFPB   jurisdiction as described in the Dodd-   Frank Act.  12  The amendments do not change the   substantive provisions of the rule or the   examples in the rule, even where those   provisions and examples involve   entities covered by the CFPB’s rule   rather than the Commission’s rule. The   VerDate Sep<11>2014  16:05 Sep 15, 2021 Jkt 253001 PO 00000 Frm 00021 Fmt 4700 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\16SER1.SGM 16SER1  51610    Federal Register   / Vol. 86, No. 177 / Thursday, September 16, 2021 / Rules and Regulations   13   5 U.S.C. 603–605.    14   85 FR 59466, 59469 (Sept. 22, 2020).   primary reason for retaining these   provisions and examples is that the rule   addresses the relationship between   covered motor vehicle dealers and their   affiliates, which may not be motor   vehicle dealers. The obligations and   exceptions set forth by the rule are   inextricably linked to a consumer’s   relationship and actions in relation to   all affiliates, both motor vehicle dealers   and non-motor vehicle dealers. In order   for the rule to apply meaningfully, it   must address both types of entities, even   those not directly covered by the rule.   This will not create any conflict with   the CFPB’s corresponding rule, as the   Commission’s Affiliate Marketing Rule   and the CFPB’s rule are substantially   similar and impose the same obligations   and exceptions on entities they cover.   IV. Paperwork Reduction Act   The Affiliate Marketing Rule contains   information collection requirements as   defined by 5 CFR 1320.3(c), the   definitional provision within the Office   of Management and Budget (‘‘OMB’’)   regulations that implement the   Paperwork Reduction Act (‘‘PRA’’). 44   U.S.C. 3501   et seq.   OMB has approved   the rule’s existing information   collection requirements through   February 28, 2023 (OMB Control No.   3084–0131). Under the existing   clearance, the FTC has attributed to   itself the estimated burden regarding all   motor vehicle dealers and shares   equally the remaining estimated PRA   burden with the CFPB for other persons   for which both agencies have   enforcement authority.   The Final Rule amends 16 CFR part   680. The amendments do not modify or   add to information collection   requirements previously approved by   OMB. The amendments make no   substantive changes to the rule, other   than to clarify that the scope of the rule   is limited to motor vehicle dealers. The   rule’s OMB clearance already reflects   that scope. Therefore, the Commission   does not believe the amendments   substantially or materially modify any   ‘‘collections of information’’ as defined   by the PRA.   V. Regulatory Flexibility Act   The Regulatory Flexibility Act   (‘‘RFA’’), as amended by the Small   Business Regulatory Enforcement   Fairness Act of 1996, requires an agency   to either provide an Initial Regulatory   Flexibility Analysis (‘‘IRFA’’) with a   proposed rule, or certify that the   proposed rule will not have a significant   impact on a substantial number of small   entities.  13  The Commission published   an Initial Regulatory Flexibility   Analysis in order to inquire into the   impact of the proposed rule on small   entities.  14  The Commission received no   responsive comments.   The Commission does not believe   these amendments have the threshold   impact on small entities. The   amendments effectuate changes to the   Dodd-Frank Act and will not impose   costs on small motor vehicle dealers   because the amendments are for   clarification purposes and will not   result in any increased burden on any   motor vehicle dealer. Thus, a small   entity that complies with current law   need not take any different or additional   action under the Final Rule. Therefore,   the Commission certifies that amending   the Affiliate Marketing Rule will not   have a significant economic impact on   a substantial number of small   businesses.   Although the Commission certifies   under the RFA that the Final Rule will   not have a significant impact on a   substantial number of small entities,   and hereby provides notice of that   certification to the Small Business   Administration, the Commission   nonetheless has determined publishing   a final regulatory flexibility analysis   (‘‘FRFA’’) is appropriate to ensure the   impact of the rule is fully addressed.   Therefore, the Commission has prepared   the following analysis:   A. Need for and Objectives of the Final   Rule   To address the Dodd-Frank Act’s   changes to the Commission’s   rulemaking authority, the amendments   clarify that the rule applies only to   motor vehicle dealers.   B. Significant Issues Raised in Public   Comments in Response to the IRFA   The Commission did not receive any   comments that addressed the burden on   small entities. In addition, the   Commission did not receive any   comments filed by the Chief Counsel for   Advocacy of the Small Business   Administration (‘‘SBA’’).   C. Estimate of Number of Small Entities   to Which the Final Rule Will Apply   The Commission anticipates many   covered motor vehicle dealers may   qualify as small businesses according to   the applicable SBA size standards. As   explained in the IRFA, however,   determining a precise estimate of the   number of small entities is not readily   feasible. No commenters addressed this   issue. Nonetheless, as discussed above,   these amendments do not add any   additional burdens on any covered   small businesses.   D. Projected Reporting, Recordkeeping,   and Other Compliance Requirements,   Including Classes of Covered Small   Entities and Professional Skills Needed   To Comply   The amendments impose no new   reporting, recordkeeping, or other   compliance requirements.   E. Description of Steps Taken To   Minimize Significant Economic Impact,   if any, on Small Entities, Including   Alternatives   The Commission did not propose any   specific small entity exemption or other   significant alternatives because the   amendments will not increase reporting   requirements and will not impose any   new requirements or compliance costs.   VI. Other Matters   Pursuant to the Congressional Review   Act (5 U.S.C. 801   et seq.  ), the Office of   Information and Regulatory Affairs   designated this rule as not a ‘‘major   rule,’’ as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2).

Abstract:   The Office of Population   Affairs (OPA), U.S. Department of   Health and Human Services (HHS) is   requesting 3 years of approval by OMB   on a new collection. The Health   Education and Relationships for Teens   Study (HEARTS) is expected to be a   large, multischool random assignment   evaluation of the Love Notes   curriculum, a popular relationship   education curriculum that is widely   implemented among federal teen   pregnancy prevention and sexual risk   avoidance education grantees. The   purpose of HEARTS is to provide   evidence of effectiveness of the Love   Notes curriculum by examining the   impacts of Love Notes on youth   outcomes such as knowledge about   healthy relationships, self-efficacy and   motivation to engage in healthy   behaviors, interpersonal communication   skills, sexual risk behaviors, and health.   The study will be conducted in   approximately 40 schools, with half   randomly assigned to deliver Love   Notes to high school youth in health or   other classes and the other half in the   control condition with business as usual   health programming. Data collection   activities are planned to begin in spring   2022 in approximately four to six   schools, with additional schools brought   into the study during the 2022–23   school year. The study will collect   youth outcome surveys at baseline and   at 6 months and 12 months following   the completion of the program. The   study will also collect extensive   implementation data, including youth   VerDate Sep<11>2014  16:44 Sep 15, 2021 Jkt 253001 PO 00000 Frm 00023 Fmt 4703 Sfmt 4703 E:\FR\FM\16SEN1.SGM 16SEN1  51672    Federal Register   / Vol. 86, No. 177 / Thursday, September 16, 2021 / Notices   engagement exit ticket surveys after   Love Notes sessions, focus groups with   youth, program facilitator logs and   attendance records, and teacher exit   ticket surveys after periodic Love Notes   sessions.

ACTION:   Final rule.   SUMMARY:   The Federal Trade   Commission (‘‘FTC’’ or ‘‘Commission’’)   is issuing a final rule (‘‘Final Rule’’) to   amend its Affiliate Marketing Rule to   correspond to changes made to the Fair   Credit Reporting Act (‘‘FCRA’’) by the   Dodd-Frank Act.   DATES:   This rule is effective October 18,   2021.   FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:   David Lincicum (202–326–2773),   Division of Privacy and Identity   Protection, Bureau of Consumer   Protection, Federal Trade Commission,   600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW,   Washington, DC 20580.   SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:   I. Background   A. The Affiliate Marketing Rule   The Fair and Accurate Credit   Transactions Act of 2003 (‘‘FACT Act’’)   was signed into law on December 4,   2003. Public Law 108–159, 117 Stat.   1952. Section 214 of the FACT Act   added a new section 624 to the FCRA.   This provision gives consumers the   right to restrict a person from using   certain information obtained from an   affiliate to make solicitations to that   consumer. Section 624 generally   provides that if a person receives certain   consumer eligibility information from   an affiliate, the person may not use that   information to make solicitations to the   consumer about its products or services,   unless the consumer is given notice and   an opportunity (via a simple method) to   opt out of such use of the information,   and the consumer does not opt out. The   statute also provides that Section 624   does not apply, for example, to a person   using eligibility information: (1) To   make solicitations to a consumer with   whom the person has a pre-existing   business relationship; (2) to perform   services for another affiliate subject to   certain conditions; (3) in response to a   communication initiated by the   consumer; or (4) to make a solicitation   that has been authorized or requested by   the consumer. Unlike the FCRA affiliate   sharing opt-out (15 U.S.C.   1681a(d)(2)(A)(iii)) and the opt-out of   sharing with non-affiliated third parties   under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act   (‘‘GLBA’’), 15 U.S.C. 6801   et seq.,   which   apply indefinitely, Section 624 provides   that a consumer’s affiliate marketing   opt-out election must be effective for a   period of at least five years. Upon   expiration of the opt-out period, the   consumer must be given a renewal   notice and an opportunity to renew the   opt-out before information received   from an affiliate may be used to make   solicitations to the consumer.   The Commission published   regulations implementing Section 624,   the Affiliate Marketing Rule, 16 CFR   part 680, on October 30, 2007.  1  B. Dodd-Frank Act   The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform   and Consumer Protection Act (‘‘Dodd-   Frank Act’’) was signed into law in   2010.  2  The Dodd-Frank Act   substantially changed the federal legal   framework for financial services   providers. Among the changes, the   Dodd-Frank Act transferred to the   Consumer Financial Protection Bureau   (‘‘CFPB’’) the Commission’s rulemaking   authority under portions of the FCRA.  3  Accordingly, in 2012, the Commission   rescinded several of its FCRA rules,   which had been replaced by rules   issued by the CFPB.  4  The FTC retained   rulemaking authority for other rules   promulgated under the FCRA to the   extent the rules apply to motor vehicle   dealers described in section 1029(a) of   the Dodd-Frank Act  5  predominantly   engaged in the sale and servicing of   motor vehicles, the leasing and   servicing of motor vehicles, or both   (‘‘motor vehicle dealers’’).  6  The rules for   which the FTC retains rulemaking   authority include the Affiliate   Marketing Rule, which now applies   only to motor vehicle dealers.  7  Entities   that are not motor vehicle dealers are   covered by the CFPB’s Regulation V,   subpart C, which is substantially similar   to the Commission’s rule.  8  II. Regulatory Review of the Affiliate   Marketing Rule   On September 22, 2020, the   Commission solicited comments on the   Affiliate Marketing Rule as part of its   periodic review of its rules and guides.  9  The Commission sought information   about the costs and benefits of the rule,   and its regulatory and economic impact.   In addition, the Commission proposed   amending the rule to narrow its scope   to motor vehicle dealers excluded from   CFPB jurisdiction as described in the   Dodd-Frank Act.  10  The Commission   received no comments.   III. Overview of Final Rule   The Commission promulgated the   Affiliate Marketing Rule at a time when   it had rulemaking authority for a   broader group of entities. While the   Dodd-Frank Act did not change the   Commission’s enforcement authority for   the Affiliate Marketing Rule, it did   narrow the Commission’s rulemaking   authority with respect to the rule. It now   covers only motor vehicle dealers. The   amendments in the Dodd-Frank Act   necessitate a technical revision to the   Affiliate Marketing Rule to ensure the   regulation is consistent with the text of   the amended FCRA. Accordingly, the   Commission amends the Affiliate   Marketing Rule to properly reflect the   rule’s scope.   The amendment to § 680.1(b) narrows   the scope description of the Affiliate   Marketing Rule to the entities excluded   from CFPB jurisdiction as described in   the Dodd-Frank Act.  11  It does so by   replacing the broad term ‘‘person’’ with   the term ‘‘motor vehicle dealer,’’ as   defined in amended § 680.3.   The amendment to § 680.3 adds a   definition of ‘‘motor vehicle dealer’’ that   defines motor vehicle dealers as those   entities excluded from CFPB   jurisdiction as described in the Dodd-   Frank Act.  12  The amendments do not change the   substantive provisions of the rule or the   examples in the rule, even where those   provisions and examples involve   entities covered by the CFPB’s rule   rather than the Commission’s rule.

Abstract:   The Office of Population   Affairs (OPA), U.S. Department of   Health and Human Services (HHS) is   requesting 3 years of approval by OMB   on a new collection. The Health   Education and Relationships for Teens   Study (HEARTS) is expected to be a   large, multischool random assignment   evaluation of the Love Notes   curriculum, a popular relationship   education curriculum that is widely   implemented among federal teen   pregnancy prevention and sexual risk   avoidance education grantees. The   purpose of HEARTS is to provide   evidence of effectiveness of the Love   Notes curriculum by examining the   impacts of Love Notes on youth   outcomes such as knowledge about   healthy relationships, self-efficacy and   motivation to engage in healthy   behaviors, interpersonal communication   skills, sexual risk behaviors, and health.   The study will be conducted in   approximately 40 schools, with half   randomly assigned to deliver Love   Notes to high school youth in health or   other classes and the other half in the   control condition with business as usual   health programming. Data collection   activities are planned to begin in spring   2022 in approximately four to six   schools, with additional schools brought   into the study during the 2022–23   school year. The study will collect   youth outcome surveys at baseline and   at 6 months and 12 months following   the completion of the program. The   study will also collect extensive   implementation data, including youth   VerDate Sep<11>2014  16:44 Sep 15, 2021 Jkt 253001 PO 00000 Frm 00023 Fmt 4703 Sfmt 4703 E:\FR\FM\16SEN1.SGM 16SEN1  "

Background on the Securities   Each Note is the unsecured obligation of a financial institution that provides for the payment at   maturity of a cash amount based on the performance of an index or other reference asset (e.g.   commodities, currencies or other financial instruments or benchmarks).

For a   more complete description of each Note, and its underlying index, see each Note’s Registration   Statement and pricing supplement and its website.   Risk Factor Information   Interested persons are referred to each Note’s Registration Statement for a description of risks   associated with an investment in the Notes.  Investing in the Notes involves a number of risks not   associated with an investment in conventional debt securities.  An investment in the Notes involves   significant risks and is not appropriate for every investor.  Investing in the Notes is not equivalent to   investing directly in the index underlying each Note. Accordingly, the Notes should be purchased   only by knowledgeable investors who understand the terms of the investment and are familiar with   the behavior of each underlying index and financial markets generally. The Notes are riskier than   ordinary unsecured debt securities.   Risks associated with an investment in the Notes may include, but are not limited to, issuer   creditworthiness; loss of all or a substantial portion of an investment in the Notes; no guaranteed   minimum payment at maturity or call, or upon acceleration or early redemption, no  payment of   interest or any coupon amount; risks associated with the applicable index or reference asset;   acceleration and redemption, resulting in a loss of all or a substantial portion of an investment; and   restriction on the minimum number of Notes that may be redeemed and on the procedures and   timing for early redemption.    Other Information About the Notes   The Notes may be subject to early redemption or acceleration in whole or in part at any time.   Accordingly, an investor should not expect to be able to hold the Notes to maturity. Additionally, the   Notes do not guarantee any return of principal at, or prior to, maturity or call, or upon early   redemption. Instead, at maturity, investors will receive a cash payment, the amount of which will vary   depending on the performance of the underlying index or reference asset, reduced by any applicable   fees, and may be zero.   Typically, the Notes may be redeemed early, at the investor’s option, subject to a minimum   redemption amount of a specified number (e.g., 50,000) of Notes.  Upon such early redemption, the   investor would receive a cash payment that is based on the performance of the underlying index or   reference asset, less any applicable fees.

The Shares will trade   on NYSE Chicago from 7:00 a.m. ET until 4:15 p.m. ET on every business day in accordance with   NYSE Chicago Article 20, Rule 1.       Extended Hours Trading   The Shares will trade on NYSE Arca, NYSE, NYSE American, NYSE National and NYSE Chicago   from 9:30 a.m. ET until 4:00 p.m. ET (the “Core Trading Session”).  In addition, the Shares will trade   (i) on NYSE Arca from 4:00 a.m. ET until 9:30 a.m. ET (the “NYSE Arca Early Trading Session”), (ii)   on the NYSE, NYSE American, NYSE National and NYSE Chicago from 7:00 a.m. ET until 9:30 a.m.   ET (the “NYSE/NYSE American/NYSE National/NYSE Chicago Early Trading Session” and, together   with the NYSE Arca Early Trading Session, the “Early Trading Sessions”), (iii) on NYSE Chicago   from 4:00 p.m. ET until 4:15 p.m. ET (the “NYSE Chicago Late Trading Session”), and (iv) on NYSE   Arca, NYSE American and NYSE National from 4:00 p.m. ET until 8:00 p.m. ET (the “NYSE   Arca/NYSE American/NYSE National Late Trading Session” and, together with the NYSE Chicago   Late Trading Session, the “Late Trading Sessions”).   Members are reminded of NYSE Arca Rule 7.34-E(d), NYSE Rule 7.34, NYSE American Rule   7.34E(e), NYSE National Rule 7.34 and NYSE Chicago Article 8, Rule 17 regarding Customer   Disclosure and that trading in the Shares during the Early Trading Sessions or Late Trading Session   may result in additional trading risks which include: (1) that the current applicable underlying index   value may not be updated during the Early Trading Sessions or Late Trading Session, (2) the IIV   may not be updated during the Early Trading Sessions or Late Trading Session, (3) lower liquidity in   the Early Trading Sessions or Late Trading Session may impact pricing, (4) higher volatility in the   Early Trading Sessions or Late Trading Session may impact pricing, (5) wider spreads may occur in   the Early Trading Sessions or Late Trading Session, and (6) since the IIV is not calculated or widely   disseminated during the Early Trading Sessions or Late Trading Session, an investor who is unable   to calculate an implied value for the Shares in those sessions may be at a disadvantage to market   professionals.

Members recommending transactions   in the Notes to customers should make a determination that the recommendation is suitable for the   customer.   FINRA has implemented increased sales practice and customer margin requirements for FINRA   members applicable to leveraged exchange-traded products and options on such products, as   described in FINRA Regulatory Notices 09-31 (June 2009), 09-53 (August 2009) and 09-65   (November 2009).   Leveraged exchange-traded products are riskier than ordinary exchange-traded products and are   not suitable for all investors. In particular, leveraged exchange-traded products should be purchased   only by investors who understand leverage risk and the consequences of seeking daily or monthly   compounded leveraged investment results, and who intend to actively monitor and manage their   investments. The Exchange makes no representation regarding the suitability of an investment in   leveraged exchange-traded products.   Trading Halts   NYSE Arca, NYSE, NYSE American, NYSE National and NYSE Chicago will halt trading in the   Shares for a regulatory halt similar to a halt based on NYSE Arca Rule 7.18-E, NYSE Rule 7.18,   NYSE American Rule 7.18E, NYSE National Rule 7.18 and NYSE Chicago Article 22, Rule 6,   respectively, and/or a halt because dissemination of the IIV of the Shares and/or the underlying   value of an index has ceased.  Further, each exchange will halt trading in the Shares in accordance   with NYSE Arca Rule 7.12-E, NYSE Rule 80B, NYSE American Rule 7.12E, NYSE National Rule   7.12 and NYSE Chicago Article 20, Rule 2  (“Trading Halts Due to Extraordinary Market Volatility”).   Exemptive, Interpretive and No-Action Relief Under Federal Securities Regulations   The Commission has issued letters (the “No-Action Letters”) granting exemptive, interpretive and no-  action relief from certain provisions of rules under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Act”) for   exchange-traded securities listed and traded on a registered national securities exchange that meet   certain criteria.    AS WHAT FOLLOWS IS ONLY A SUMMARY OF THE RELIEF OUTLINED IN THE NO-ACTION   LETTERS REFERENCED ABOVE, THE EXCHANGE ADVISES INTERESTED PARTIES TO   CONSULT THE NO-ACTION LETTERS FOR MORE COMPLETE INFORMATION REGARDING   THE MATTERS COVERED THEREIN AND THE APPLICABILITY OF THE RELIEF GRANTED IN   RESPECT OF TRADING IN SECURITIES.  INTERESTED PARTIES SHOULD ALSO CONSULT   THEIR PROFESSIONAL ADVISORS.

The provisions of the   Rules apply to underwriters, prospective underwriters, brokers, dealers, and other persons who have   agreed to participate or are participating in a distribution of securities, and affiliated purchasers of   such persons.   The exemptive letters state that the SEC Division of Trading and Markets will not recommend   enforcement action under Rule 101 of Regulation M against persons who may be deemed to be   participating in a distribution of Notes to bid for or purchase the Notes during their participation in   such distribution.   Rule 102 of Regulation M prohibits issuers, selling security holders, or any affiliated purchaser of   such person from bidding for, purchasing, or attempting to induce any person to bid for or purchase   a covered security during the applicable restricted period in connection with a distribution of   securities effected by or on behalf of an issuer or selling security holder.  Rule 100 of Regulation M   defines “distribution” to mean any offering of securities that is distinguished from ordinary trading   transactions by the magnitude of the offering and the presence of special selling efforts and selling   methods.   The exemptive letters state that the SEC Division of Trading and Markets will not recommend   enforcement action under Rule 102 of Regulation M against the issuer and its affiliated purchasers   who bid for or purchase or redeem notes during the continuous offering of the notes.   Section 11(d)(1) of the Exchange Act; Exchange Act Rule 11d1-2   Section 11(d)(1) of the Exchange Act generally prohibits a person who is both a broker and a dealer   from effecting any transaction in which the broker-dealer extends credit to a customer on any   security which was part of a new issue in the distribution of which he or she participated as a   member of a selling syndicate or group within thirty days prior to such transaction.   The exemptive letters state that the SEC Division of Trading and Markets will not recommend   enforcement action under Section 11(d)(1) of the Exchange Act against broker-dealers who treat   Notes, for purposes of Rule 11d1-2, as “securities issued by a registered . . . open-end investment   company as defined in the Investment Company Act” and thereby, extend credit or maintain or   arrange for the extension or maintenance of credit on the notes that have been owned by the   persons to whom credit is provided for more than 30 days, in reliance on the exemption contained in   the rule.   This Information Bulletin is not a statutory prospectus. Members should consult the   applicable trust’s registration statement, Statement of Additional Information, prospectus and   each Note’s website for relevant information.   "

Risks associated with an investment in the Notes may include, but are not limited to, issuer   creditworthiness; loss of all or a substantial portion of an investment in the Notes; no guaranteed   minimum payment at maturity or call, or upon acceleration or early redemption, no  payment of   interest or any coupon amount; risks associated with the applicable index or reference asset;   acceleration and redemption, resulting in a loss of all or a substantial portion of an investment; and   restriction on the minimum number of Notes that may be redeemed and on the procedures and   timing for early redemption.    Other Information About the Notes   The Notes may be subject to early redemption or acceleration in whole or in part at any time.   Accordingly, an investor should not expect to be able to hold the Notes to maturity. Additionally, the   Notes do not guarantee any return of principal at, or prior to, maturity or call, or upon early   redemption. Instead, at maturity, investors will receive a cash payment, the amount of which will vary   depending on the performance of the underlying index or reference asset, reduced by any applicable   fees, and may be zero.   Typically, the Notes may be redeemed early, at the investor’s option, subject to a minimum   redemption amount of a specified number (e.g., 50,000) of Notes.  Upon such early redemption, the   investor would receive a cash payment that is based on the performance of the underlying index or   reference asset, less any applicable fees.

The provisions of the   Rules apply to underwriters, prospective underwriters, brokers, dealers, and other persons who have   agreed to participate or are participating in a distribution of securities, and affiliated purchasers of   such persons.   The exemptive letters state that the SEC Division of Trading and Markets will not recommend   enforcement action under Rule 101 of Regulation M against persons who may be deemed to be   participating in a distribution of Notes to bid for or purchase the Notes during their participation in   such distribution.   Rule 102 of Regulation M prohibits issuers, selling security holders, or any affiliated purchaser of   such person from bidding for, purchasing, or attempting to induce any person to bid for or purchase   a covered security during the applicable restricted period in connection with a distribution of   securities effected by or on behalf of an issuer or selling security holder.  Rule 100 of Regulation M   defines “distribution” to mean any offering of securities that is distinguished from ordinary trading   transactions by the magnitude of the offering and the presence of special selling efforts and selling   methods.   The exemptive letters state that the SEC Division of Trading and Markets will not recommend   enforcement action under Rule 102 of Regulation M against the issuer and its affiliated purchasers   who bid for or purchase or redeem notes during the continuous offering of the notes.   Section 11(d)(1) of the Exchange Act; Exchange Act Rule 11d1-2   Section 11(d)(1) of the Exchange Act generally prohibits a person who is both a broker and a dealer   from effecting any transaction in which the broker-dealer extends credit to a customer on any   security which was part of a new issue in the distribution of which he or she participated as a   member of a selling syndicate or group within thirty days prior to such transaction.   The exemptive letters state that the SEC Division of Trading and Markets will not recommend   enforcement action under Section 11(d)(1) of the Exchange Act against broker-dealers who treat   Notes, for purposes of Rule 11d1-2, as “securities issued by a registered . . . open-end investment   company as defined in the Investment Company Act” and thereby, extend credit or maintain or   arrange for the extension or maintenance of credit on the notes that have been owned by the   persons to whom credit is provided for more than 30 days, in reliance on the exemption contained in   the rule.

Investing in the Notes involves a number of risks not   associated with an investment in conventional debt securities.  An investment in the Notes involves   significant risks and is not appropriate for every investor.  Investing in the Notes is not equivalent to   investing directly in the index underlying each Note. Accordingly, the Notes should be purchased   only by knowledgeable investors who understand the terms of the investment and are familiar with   the behavior of each underlying index and financial markets generally. The Notes are riskier than   ordinary unsecured debt securities.   Risks associated with an investment in the Notes may include, but are not limited to, issuer   creditworthiness; loss of all or a substantial portion of an investment in the Notes; no guaranteed   minimum payment at maturity or call, or upon acceleration or early redemption, no  payment of   interest or any coupon amount; risks associated with the applicable index or reference asset;   acceleration and redemption, resulting in a loss of all or a substantial portion of an investment; and   restriction on the minimum number of Notes that may be redeemed and on the procedures and   timing for early redemption.    Other Information About the Notes   The Notes may be subject to early redemption or acceleration in whole or in part at any time.   Accordingly, an investor should not expect to be able to hold the Notes to maturity. Additionally, the   Notes do not guarantee any return of principal at, or prior to, maturity or call, or upon early   redemption.

Additionally, the   Notes do not guarantee any return of principal at, or prior to, maturity or call, or upon early   redemption. Instead, at maturity, investors will receive a cash payment, the amount of which will vary   depending on the performance of the underlying index or reference asset, reduced by any applicable   fees, and may be zero.   Typically, the Notes may be redeemed early, at the investor’s option, subject to a minimum   redemption amount of a specified number (e.g., 50,000) of Notes.  Upon such early redemption, the   investor would receive a cash payment that is based on the performance of the underlying index or   reference asset, less any applicable fees.

Leveraged exchange-traded products are riskier than ordinary exchange-traded products and are   not suitable for all investors. In particular, leveraged exchange-traded products should be purchased   only by investors who understand leverage risk and the consequences of seeking daily or monthly   compounded leveraged investment results, and who intend to actively monitor and manage their   investments. The Exchange makes no representation regarding the suitability of an investment in   leveraged exchange-traded products.

The provisions of the   Rules apply to underwriters, prospective underwriters, brokers, dealers, and other persons who have   agreed to participate or are participating in a distribution of securities, and affiliated purchasers of   such persons.   The exemptive letters state that the SEC Division of Trading and Markets will not recommend   enforcement action under Rule 101 of Regulation M against persons who may be deemed to be   participating in a distribution of Notes to bid for or purchase the Notes during their participation in   such distribution.   Rule 102 of Regulation M prohibits issuers, selling security holders, or any affiliated purchaser of   such person from bidding for, purchasing, or attempting to induce any person to bid for or purchase   a covered security during the applicable restricted period in connection with a distribution of   securities effected by or on behalf of an issuer or selling security holder.  Rule 100 of Regulation M   defines “distribution” to mean any offering of securities that is distinguished from ordinary trading   transactions by the magnitude of the offering and the presence of special selling efforts and selling   methods.   The exemptive letters state that the SEC Division of Trading and Markets will not recommend   enforcement action under Rule 102 of Regulation M against the issuer and its affiliated purchasers   who bid for or purchase or redeem notes during the continuous offering of the notes.   Section 11(d)(1) of the Exchange Act; Exchange Act Rule 11d1-2   Section 11(d)(1) of the Exchange Act generally prohibits a person who is both a broker and a dealer   from effecting any transaction in which the broker-dealer extends credit to a customer on any   security which was part of a new issue in the distribution of which he or she participated as a   member of a selling syndicate or group within thirty days prior to such transaction.   The exemptive letters state that the SEC Division of Trading and Markets will not recommend   enforcement action under Section 11(d)(1) of the Exchange Act against broker-dealers who treat   Notes, for purposes of Rule 11d1-2, as “securities issued by a registered . . . open-end investment   company as defined in the Investment Company Act” and thereby, extend credit or maintain or   arrange for the extension or maintenance of credit on the notes that have been owned by the   persons to whom credit is provided for more than 30 days, in reliance on the exemption contained in   the rule.

Please forward this information Bulletin to other interested persons   within your organization.     Background on the Securities   Each Note is the unsecured obligation of a financial institution that provides for the payment at   maturity of a cash amount based on the performance of an index or other reference asset (e.g.   commodities, currencies or other financial instruments or benchmarks).

For a   more complete description of each Note, and its underlying index, see each Note’s Registration   Statement and pricing supplement and its website.   Risk Factor Information   Interested persons are referred to each Note’s Registration Statement for a description of risks   associated with an investment in the Notes.  Investing in the Notes involves a number of risks not   associated with an investment in conventional debt securities.  An investment in the Notes involves   significant risks and is not appropriate for every investor.  Investing in the Notes is not equivalent to   investing directly in the index underlying each Note. Accordingly, the Notes should be purchased   only by knowledgeable investors who understand the terms of the investment and are familiar with   the behavior of each underlying index and financial markets generally. The Notes are riskier than   ordinary unsecured debt securities.   Risks associated with an investment in the Notes may include, but are not limited to, issuer   creditworthiness; loss of all or a substantial portion of an investment in the Notes; no guaranteed   minimum payment at maturity or call, or upon acceleration or early redemption, no  payment of   interest or any coupon amount; risks associated with the applicable index or reference asset;   acceleration and redemption, resulting in a loss of all or a substantial portion of an investment; and   restriction on the minimum number of Notes that may be redeemed and on the procedures and   timing for early redemption.    Other Information About the Notes   The Notes may be subject to early redemption or acceleration in whole or in part at any time.   Accordingly, an investor should not expect to be able to hold the Notes to maturity. Additionally, the   Notes do not guarantee any return of principal at, or prior to, maturity or call, or upon early   redemption. Instead, at maturity, investors will receive a cash payment, the amount of which will vary   depending on the performance of the underlying index or reference asset, reduced by any applicable   fees, and may be zero.   Typically, the Notes may be redeemed early, at the investor’s option, subject to a minimum   redemption amount of a specified number (e.g., 50,000) of Notes.  Upon such early redemption, the   investor would receive a cash payment that is based on the performance of the underlying index or   reference asset, less any applicable fees.

Equal Credit Opportunity Act,CFPB Sues Online Lender Over Alleged CFPA and ECOA Violations,JD Supra Commercial Law,JD Supra,"CFPB Sues Online Lender Over Alleged CFPA and ECOA Violations  On September 8, 2021 the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) announced that it filed a complaint against an online lender for alleged violations of a 2016 consent order, the Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA), 12 U.S.C. §§ 5564, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA), 15 U.S.C. §§ 1691–1691f, and Regulation B (Reg B), 12 C.F.R. § 1002.9(a)–(b).  In 2016, and as previously covered by Enforcement Watch, the CFPB entered a consent order to resolve alleged violations of the Consumer Financial Protection Act, Truth in Lending Act, and their implementing regulations. The 2016 consent order required the lender to pay a $1.8 million civil penalty and $1.83 million in redress, and to cease its allegedly unlawful practices.  In its new lawsuit, the CFPB alleges that the lender has continued the same allegedly unlawful practices, including deceptive marketing and failure to provide timely and accurate notices to borrowers. Specifically, the complaint alleges that the lender misrepresented the benefits of borrowing from it, including by falsely claiming that certain “returning borrowers . . . gain access to larger loans at lower interest rates.” The complaint further alleges that the lender failed to provide timely and adequate notice of adverse action taken as to thousands of loan applications, as is required by the ECOA and Reg B.  The CFPB seeks injunctive relief, costs, civil penalties, and additional monetary relief for consumers and unjust enrichment."

Background   On May 20  2021, in order to facilitate the rule-making process for the Proposed Amendments, the   CSA published Notice 94-304 -   Frequency of the requirement to deliver Form 94-102F3 Customer   Collateral Report: Regulated Clearing Agency (  Notice 94-304)   announcing that all jurisdictions,   except the Ontario Securities Commission (the   OSC  ), were making/issuing, as applicable in the   local jurisdiction, parallel orders of general application (the   Orders  ) reducing the frequency of the   requirement  for regulated clearing agencies  1     to deliver Form 94-102F3    Customer Collateral   Report: Regulated Clearing Agency (  Form 94-102F3).   The Orders came into effect on August 1,   2021  2  .     The  OSC  made amendments to NI 94-102, which have the same effect as the Orders. These   amendments came into force on August 1, 2021  3  .      The CSA, except the OSC, are now proposing to amend NI 94-102 to reduce the frequency of the   requirement to deliver Form 94-102F3.   1   A regulated clearing agency is defined in NI 94-102 as “(a) in British Columbia, Manitoba and Ontario, a   person or company recognized or exempt from recognition as a clearing agency in the local jurisdiction,   and (b) in Alberta, Newfoundland and Labrador, New Brunswick, the Northwest Territories, Nova Scotia,   Nunavut, Prince Edward Island, Québec, Saskatchewan and Yukon, a person or company recognized or   exempt from recognition as a clearing agency or clearing house pursuant to the securities legislation of any   jurisdiction of Canada”.   2  Blanket Order 94-502, available on the website of the securities regulatory authority in the local   jurisdiction.   3     See, in Ontario, Amendment to National Instrument 94-102 Derivatives: Customer Clearing and Protection of   Customer Collateral and Positions,  published  May 20, 2021. The Amendments, which do not include any new   requirements, were made by the OSC on an expedited basis, and without prior publication for comment, as permitted   under paragraph 143.2(5)(b) of the   Securities Act   (Ontario).   -2-   Substance and Purpose of the Proposed Amendments   As detailed in Notice 94-304, the Proposed Amendments were developed by the CSA as a way to   reduce regulatory  burden without compromising investor protection or adversely impacting   systemic risk.   The CSA recognize that clearing intermediaries that receive customer collateral are also required   to deliver information to the securities regulatory authority in either Form 94-102F1   Customer   Collateral Report: Direct Intermediary   or Form 94-102F2   Customer Collateral Report: Indirect   Intermediary,   as applicable, each of which presents a snapshot of the value of collateral held or   posted by each reporting clearing intermediary.  The  CSA  note,  however,  that Form 94-102F3   provides a snapshot of the value of customer collateral received by the regulated clearing agency   from each clearing intermediary and the location where the regulated clearing agency holds this   customer collateral and its value. This information is not otherwise available to the CSA.    Furthermore, reporting Form 94-102F3, together with Form 94-102F1 and Form 94-102F2, allows   for data reconciliation, and allows  the CSA to detect and respond to major changes in the   derivatives clearing market, as well as to monitor customer collateral arrangements in support of   the development and implementation of rules that protect customer assets and are responsive to   market practices.    Reducing the frequency of the requirement to deliver Form 94-102F3 from monthly to quarterly   generates time and cost savings for regulated clearing agencies, without compromising the CSA’s   ability to detect major changes in the derivatives clearing market and to ensure the proper   identification of customer collateral and the clearing intermediaries, regulated clearing agencies   and permitted depositories that hold it.    Summary of the Proposed Amendments   Except in Ontario and subject to the Orders, section 43 of NI 94-102 currently requires a regulated   clearing agency  that receives customer collateral to electronically deliver a completed Form 94-  102F3 to the relevant regulator or securities regulatory authority, within 10 business days of the   end of each calendar month.   The CSA is proposing to amend NI 94-102 to reduce the frequency of the requirement to deliver   Form 94-102F3 from monthly to quarterly. As a result of the Proposed Amendments, a regulated   clearing agency will be required to electronically deliver a completed Form 94-102F3 within 10   days of the end of each calendar quarter.   -3-   Contents of Annexes   The following annexes form part of this notice:   •  Annex A – Proposed Amendments to National Instrument 94-102   Derivatives: Customer   Clearing and Protection of Customer Collateral and Positions   •    Annex B - Blackline of National Instrument 94-102   Derivatives: Customer Clearing and   Protection of Customer Collateral and Positions   showing the proposed amendments   •  Annex C – Local Matters, where applicable   Request for Comments    Please provide your comments in writing by   November 15, 2021  .

ORDER INSTITUTING ADMINISTRATIVE   AND CEASE-AND-DESIST PROCEEDINGS,   PURSUANT TO SECTIONS 203(e) AND   203(k) OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS   ACT OF 1940, MAKING FINDINGS, AND   IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS AND   A CEASE-AND-DESIST ORDER    I.      The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate and in the   public interest that public administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are,   instituted pursuant to Sections 203(e) and 203(k) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940   (“Advisers Act”) against BFC Planning, Inc. (“BFC” or “Respondent”).     II.      In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer   of Settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the   purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the   Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings   herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over it and the subject matter of these   proceedings, which are admitted, Respondent consents to the entry of this Order Instituting   Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings, Pursuant to Sections 203(e) and 203(k) of the   Investment Advisers Act of 1940, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a   Cease-and-Desist Order (“Order”), as set forth below.   III.      On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds  1    that:    1    The findings herein are made pursuant to BFC’s Offer of Settlement and are not binding on any other person or   entity in this or any other proceeding.    2   Summary   1.  These proceedings arise out of breaches of fiduciary duty by BFC, a registered   investment adviser, in connection with its mutual fund share class selection practices that resulted in   receipt by its affiliate Berthel Fisher & Company Financial Services, Inc. (“BFCFS”), a dually-  registered broker-dealer and registered investment adviser, of two types of fees from BFC’s   advisory clients’ investments at times from January 2014 through March 2018.  These fees   included: (1) fees BFCFS received when BFC purchased, recommended, or held for BFC’s   advisory clients mutual fund share classes that paid fees pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the   Investment Company Act of 1940 (“12b-1 fees”) instead of lower-cost available share classes of the   same funds that did not charge these fees; and (2) fees BFCFS received from its unaffiliated   clearing broker as a result of BFC’s advisory clients’ uninvested cash being swept into share classes   of certain money market mutual funds (“money market funds”) instead of lower-cost share classes   of the same money market funds that did not result in the payment of fees to BFCFS that were   available to clients.     2.  First, from January 2014 through March 2018 (the “Relevant 12b-1 Period”),   BFCFS and its registered representatives who were also investment advisory representatives   (“IARs”) of BFC received 12b-1 fees from mutual fund share classes that BFC had purchased,   recommended, or held for advisory clients mutual fund share classes that charged 12b-1 fees instead   of lower-cost share classes of the same funds that were available to the clients.  BFC did not   adequately disclose this conflict of interest in its Forms ADV or otherwise.  BFC, although eligible   to do so, did not self-report this 12b-1 fee related conflict of interest to the Commission pursuant to   the Division of Enforcement’s (the “Division”) Share Class Selection Disclosure Initiative (“SCSD   Initiative”).  2  3.  Second, from September 2016 through March 2018 (the “Relevant Cash Sweep   Period”), BFCFS received revenue sharing payments from the clearing broker based on the amount   of Respondents’ advisory client assets invested in certain share classes of money market funds used   as cash sweep vehicles.  During the Relevant Cash Sweep Period, BFCFS’s agreement with the   clearing broker provided options to sweep BFC’s clients’ cash into share classes of the same money   market funds that had lower costs to fund investors and did not pay revenue sharing.  BFC selected   higher-cost revenue sharing money market fund share classes instead of lower-cost share classes of   the same money market funds that did not pay revenue sharing to BFCFS and were available to   advisory clients.  BFC did not adequately disclose this conflict of interest in its Forms ADV or   otherwise.     4.  From at least January 2014, BFC also, by causing certain of its advisory clients to   invest in higher-cost share classes of mutual funds that paid 12b-1 fees and money market funds   that resulted in revenue sharing payments when fund share classes were available to the clients that   2    See   Div. of Enforcement, U.S. Sec. & Exch. Comm’n,   Share Class Selection Disclosure Initiative,   https://www.sec.gov/enforce/announcement/scsd-initiative (last modified Feb. 12, 2018).   3   presented a more favorable value under the particular circumstances in place at the time of the   transactions, breached its duty to seek best execution for those transactions.     5.  During each of the relevant periods, BFC also failed to adopt and implement written   compliance policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations of the Advisers Act   and the rules thereunder in connection with mutual fund and money market fund share class   selection practices.   Respondent   6.  Respondent BFC Planning, Inc. (“BFC”) is an Iowa corporation based in Cedar   Rapids, Iowa.  BFC has been registered with the Commission as an investment adviser since   January 3, 2007.  In its March 31, 2021 Form ADV, Part 1 BFC reported regulatory assets under   management of $1,274,830,615.  BFC provides advisory services through its IARs, all of whom   are registered representatives of BFCFS.     Related Parties   7.  Berthel Fisher & Company is an Iowa corporation based in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.    BFC is a subsidiary of Berthel Fisher & Company.   8.  Berthel Fisher & Company Financial Services, Inc. (“BFCFS”) is an Iowa   corporation based in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.  BFCFS has been registered with the Commission as an   investment adviser since August 27, 2003 and has been registered with the Commission as a   broker-dealer since June 1983 (CRD #13609).  BFCFS is also a subsidiary of Berthel Fisher &   Company, and, therefore, BFCFS and BFC are under common control with each other.   Mutual Fund Share Class Selection and 12b-1 Fees   9.  Mutual funds typically offer investors different types of shares or “share classes.”   Each share class represents an interest in the same portfolio of securities with the same investment   objective.  The primary difference among the share classes is the fee structure.   10.  For example, some mutual fund share classes charge 12b-1 fees to cover certain   costs of fund distribution and sometimes shareholder services.  These recurring fees, which are   included in a mutual fund’s total annual fund operating expenses, vary by share class, but typically   range from 25 to 100 basis points.  They are deducted from the mutual fund’s assets on an ongoing   basis and paid to the fund’s distributor or principal underwriter, which generally remits the 12b-1   fees to the broker-dealer that distributed or sold the shares.      4   11.  Many mutual funds also offer share classes that do not charge 12b-1 fees (e.g.,   “Institutional Class” or “Class I” shares (collectively, “Class I shares”)).  3    An investor who holds   Class I shares of a mutual fund will usually pay lower total annual fund operating expenses over   time – and thus will generally earn higher returns – than one who holds a share class of the same   fund that charges 12b-1 fees.  Therefore, if a mutual fund offers a Class I share, and an investor is   eligible to own it, it is often, though not always, better for the investor to purchase or hold the   Class I share.    12.  During the Relevant 12b-1 Period, BFC and its IARs purchased, recommended or   held  4    for clients mutual fund share classes that charged 12b-1 fees when lower-cost share classes of   those same funds were available to those clients.  BFCFS received 12b-1 fees that it would not   have collected had its advisory clients been invested in the available lower-cost share classes.    BFCFS shared a portion of these fees with its registered representatives who were IARs of BFC.   13.  The payments BFCFS received from the clearing broker created an incentive for   BFC to recommend its advisory clients buy or hold share classes that paid 12b-1 fees over other   share classes of the same mutual funds that did not pay 12b-1 fees when rendering investment   advice to BFC’s advisory clients.  In April 2018, BFC began to credit to advisory client accounts   on a going-forward basis 12b-1 fees received on share classes held by the advisory clients.    Cash Sweep Share Class Selection and Revenue Sharing Payments   14.  A sweep account (“Sweep Account”) is a money market mutual fund or bank   account used by broker-dealers to hold uninvested cash (  e.g.  , incoming cash deposits, dividends, or   certain investment returns) until the investor or its adviser decides how to invest the money.    During the Relevant Cash Sweep Period, BFC recommended that clients choose certain money   market fund share classes to hold uninvested cash in the clients’ Sweep Accounts.  A money   market fund is a type of mutual fund registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and   regulated pursuant to Rule 2a-7 under that Act.  Money market funds generally invest in short   term, highly liquid securities with limited credit risk, and are frequently used in Sweep Accounts as   cash sweep vehicles.  The investment yields and expense ratio of a money market fund will differ   from fund to fund.   15.  During the Relevant Cash Sweep Period, the clearing broker agreed to share with   BFCFS a portion of the revenue the clearing broker received in connection with certain share   classes of money market funds offered to Sweep Accounts.  Another share class of the same   money market funds was available to BFC’s clients that did not pay BFCFS any revenue sharing   for client assets and had lower expenses and higher yields for BFC’s clients than the revenue   sharing money market fund share classes.     3    Share classes that do not charge 12b-1 fees also go by a variety of other names in the mutual fund industry, such as   “Class F2,” “Class Y” and “Class Z” shares.  As used in this Order, the term “Class I shares” refers generically to   share classes that do not charge 12b-1 fees.     4    In many cases, mutual funds permit certain advisory clients who hold shares in classes charging 12b-1 fees to   convert those shares to Class I shares without cost or tax consequences to the client.    5   16.  The amount of revenue sharing BFCFS received from the clearing broker differed   depending on the share class of the money market fund that BFC recommended to its advisory   clients and the amount of assets advisory clients, who were BFCFS brokerage customers, held in   the share class.  During the Relevant Cash Sweep Period, even though a share class of the same   money market fund that did not result in revenue sharing payments was always available to its   clients, BFC routinely purchased, recommended or held for clients share classes of money market   funds for cash sweep vehicles that paid revenue sharing to BFCFS rather than those that did not.   17.  The payments BFCFS received from the clearing broker for higher-cost revenue   sharing money market fund share classes created an incentive for BFC to recommend advisory   clients purchase or hold a money market fund share class that paid revenue sharing over share   classes of the same money market funds that did not pay revenue sharing.  In April 2018, BFC   began to credit to BFC advisory client accounts on a going-forward basis revenue sharing received   on money market fund share classes in Sweep Accounts held by BFC advisory clients.   Disclosure Failures   18.  As an investment adviser, BFC was obligated to disclose all material facts to   advisory clients, including any conflicts of interest between the adviser and its clients, that could   affect the advisory relationship and how those conflicts could affect the advice BFC provided its   clients.  To meet this fiduciary obligation, BFC was required to provide advisory clients with full   and fair disclosure that is sufficiently specific so that the advisory clients could understand the   conflicts of interest concerning BFC’s advice about investing in different share classes of mutual   funds or money market funds, and could have an informed basis on which advisory clients could   consent to or reject the conflicts.     19.  During the Relevant 12b-1 Period, BFC’s Form ADV Part 2A brochures disclosed   that advisory clients “may incur” 12b-1 fees, and that because IARs “may receive 12b-1 fees …   there is a potential conflict of interest.”  BFC did not disclose the conflicts of interest that arose   when it invested advisory clients in a mutual fund share class that would generate 12b-1 fee   revenue for BFCFS and for BFC’s IARs, while share classes of the same funds that did not pay   12b-1 fees were available to its clients.   20.  During the Relevant Cash Sweep Period, BFC’s Form ADV Part 2A brochures   disclosed that BFC “… and our affiliated broker-dealers may have entered into various   arrangements … referred to as revenue sharing arrangements,” and that “these situations present a   conflict of interest that may affect the judgment of our affiliated persons.”  BFC did not disclose   the conflicts of interest that arose when it invested advisory clients in a money market fund share   class that would generate revenue sharing for BFCFS, while share classes of the same funds that   did not generate this revenue were available to its clients.    6   Best Execution Failures   21.  An investment adviser’s fiduciary duty includes, among other things, an obligation   to seek best execution for client transactions.  5  22.  From at least January 2014, by causing certain of its advisory clients to invest in   share classes of mutual funds that paid 12b-1 fees and money market funds that resulted in revenue   sharing payments from the clearing broker to BFCFS when share classes were available that   presented a more favorable value under the particular circumstances in place at the time of the   transactions, BFC violated its duty to seek best execution for those transactions.    Compliance Deficiencies   23.  During each of the Relevant Periods, BFC failed to adopt and implement written   compliance policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations of the Advisers Act   and the rules thereunder in connection with its mutual fund and money market fund share class   selection practices.     Disgorgement   24.

Read More The post CFPB Sues Online Lender Over Alleged CFPA and ECOA Violations appeared first on Consumer Finance Enforcement Watch.  On September 8, 2021 the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) announced that it filed a complaint against an online lender for alleged violations of a 2016 consent order, the Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA), 12 U.S.C. §§ 5564, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA), 15 U.S.C. §§ 1691–1691f, and Regulation B (Reg B), 12 C.F.R. § 1002.9(a)–(b).  In 2016, and as previously covered by Enforcement Watch, the CFPB entered a consent order to resolve alleged violations of the Consumer Financial Protection Act, Truth in Lending Act, and their implementing regulations. The 2016 consent order required the lender to pay a $1.8 million civil penalty and $1.83 million in redress, and to cease its allegedly unlawful practices.  In its new lawsuit, the CFPB alleges that the lender has continued the same allegedly unlawful practices, including deceptive marketing and failure to provide timely and accurate notices to borrowers. Specifically, the complaint alleges that the lender misrepresented the benefits of borrowing from it, including by falsely claiming that certain “returning borrowers . . . gain access to larger loans at lower interest rates.” The complaint further alleges that the lender failed to provide timely and adequate notice of adverse action taken as to thousands of loan applications, as is required by the ECOA and Reg B.  The CFPB seeks injunctive relief, costs, civil penalties, and additional monetary relief for consumers and unjust enrichment."
Federal Insurance Contributions Act,House Estate Tax Proposal Requires Immediate Action,Forbes | Retirement news,Forbes,"House Estate Tax Proposal Requires Immediate Action  The House tax proposal is wide reaching and will have a dramatic impact on estate and related tax planning for high income and wealthy taxpayers.  Recent Proposal  The House Democrats are proposing a $3.5 trillion spending plan. To support that package the Democrats have proposed tax increases to fund a large portion of that plan. The House Ways and Means Committee just issued statutory language for the tax increase proposal. While the tax legislative process will no doubt evolve with many twists and turns, these proposals might well be the blueprint for any final legislation. The implications of this are quite simple. Taxpayers who might be affected need to plan and take action now. If you’ve been sitting on the tax planning fence waiting to see what will be enacted, this proposal suggests you jump off the fence and plan with haste. This article will explain some of the “why” and “how.” Keep in mind, there remains incredible uncertainty, but inaction might prove the costliest option for some.  Overview of What the House Proposal Does and Doesn’t Include  This article will focus on estate planning changes, and actions you should consider with your advisory team now. But, some discussion of income tax changes is necessary as many of the income tax changes will have an impact on your estate tax planning. As expected, individual and corporate income tax rates will increase. What might be unexpected is the many different ways that taxes will be increased. The manner in which some of these changes are applied to trusts, the foundation of much of estate planning, is particularly harsh. Taxpayers contemplating immediate transfers to trusts for estate tax purposes, must also consider these income tax rules. Restrictions will affect retirement accounts as well.  Capital gains rates will be increased, but not as bad as being taxed at ordinary income rates.  From an estate tax perspective, the exemption will be cut in half, grantor trusts which have been the cornerstone of estate planning will be dramatically restricted, and valuation discounts which have been the elixir for many estate plans will be restricted.  Noticeably absent from the proposal are a host of changes that had been discussed. This includes the so-called “deemed realization” rules that would trigger capital gains tax gifts of appreciated assets, on death, or the transfer of assets from certain trusts. The adjustment of tax basis on death remains part of the law although many had anticipated its elimination. Thus, heirs who inherit appreciated assets will have that appreciation added to the tax basis so that a later sale will still not trigger gain (so long as there is no appreciation from date of death until the date of sale). That had been identified as a major loophole benefiting the wealthy, but it was not addressed. Some of the restrictions on dynastic trusts that had been included in the Sanders plan seem absent. But before wealthy taxpayers feel relief, consider that this proposal must wind its way through the Senate and any of these more restrictive changes could be added there. Easing the restrictions on deducting state and local taxes that had been introduced in the 2017 tax legislation was not included.  Effective Dates  When the proposals become effective is critical to determining if you have time to plan before the law changes, and how much time that might be. While many changes apply to tax years beginning after December 31, 2021, i.e., for most provisions they are to become effective in 2022, this is not true for all changes. 2022 is a common effective date for many provisions but caution is in order. There are significant provisions in the House proposal that have earlier effective dates. The discussions following will identify the proposed effective date of many provisions and explain the possible implications of those effective dates for planning. The bottom line for many planning steps is that you should act immediately and urgently. Uncertainly remains. Some critically important provisions to estate planning are pegged to become effective on the date of enactment. But when might that be?   7 Ways The New Tax Bill Could Impact Retirement Planning  Caregiver Expenses New Credit  There are several provisions in the House proposal that are helpful to taxpayers, and in particular to lower income taxpayers. This is one such example and this income tax credit could have important estate and related planning implications for lower income aging taxpayers. A tax credit will be provided, up to $4,000, for 50% of qualified expenses incurred caring for relatives living at home unable to perform the activates of daily living. This tax benefit will be phased-out if the taxpayer’s income exceeds $75,000. Thus, for lower income taxpayers this will take the edge of care costs for those living with chronic illness, other health issues and the challenges of aging.  Increase in Individual Income Tax Rates  The highest or “marginal” individual income tax rate increases to 39.6%. This rate would apply to married individuals filing joint tax returns with taxable income over $450,000, and to unmarried taxpayers with taxable income over $400,000. For many of the proposed changes the $400-$450,000 level of income is the demarcation of what is considered in the proposal to be high income and thus subject to higher tax changes, not only this change in rates. While this change will no doubt raise revenue this increase in rates alone may not trigger significant planning. Although, if you were to contemplate a Roth conversion it would be advantageous to do so before this rate increase becomes effective. But this higher income tax rate is even more significant when taken together with all the other tax increases on the wealthy discussed below. The many changes overall will be substantial for many taxpayers. For example, see the 3% surtax, increase in net investment income taxes, reduction in 199A deduction, etc.  This increase in income tax rates, as well as other income tax rate changes discussed below, have critical importance to estate planning. The highest rate applies to estates and trusts with taxable income over $12,500. That is a tiny fraction of the income level at which the highest rates apply to individuals, e.g., the family members who may be beneficiaries of an irrevocable trust. For estates and trusts in 2021 it may be worth accelerating income while rates are lower. For so-called complex or non-grantor trusts that pay their own income tax (e.g., a credit shelter trust funded on the death of a spouse) distributions may carry out income to the beneficiary and thus be taxed at a lower rate. So, the benefits of a possibly lower tax rate should be weighed against the provision of funds outright to a beneficiary (is the beneficiary responsible?) and the inclusion of those funds in the beneficiary’s estate if the distributed funds are not spent. Consider the implications of this to an accumulation trust created post-Secure Act. The Secure Act changed the rules applicable to retirement plans effectively eliminating the stretch-IRA. As a result, some taxpayers made funds payable to trusts to protect the beneficiaries of their plan assets. However, if all plan assets are distributed at the end of the 10th year following your death (as the plan holder) those funds are more likely to hit the new highest rate (and see the surtax discussion below).  This change applies to tax years beginning after December 31, 2021.  Sec. 138201 changing Sec. l(j)(2).  Tax Surcharge on High Income Individuals, Trusts, and Estates  A further increase in marginal income tax rates applies to certain high income taxpayers. Perhaps the idea was to make it appear, for political optics, that the maximum tax rate is only 39.6% as discussed above, when in fact the actual rate is 42.6%. This new provision imposes an additional tax of 3% of a taxpayer's modified adjusted gross income (“MAGI”) in excess of $5 million for married taxpayers filing joint returns. This provision is just another example as to the greater increase in tax rates for high income taxpayers beyond the 39.6% rate noted above.  The MAGI figure for trusts and estates is $100,000. This will thus, at a relatively low income level, subject trust income to a very high 42.6% tax rate. State and local taxes (and other changes in the House proposal) may make that effective tax rate even higher. Consider the impact of this in light of retirement assets paid to trusts. The Secure Act, as noted above, may have resulted in some plan holders changing beneficiaries to trusts because of the elimination of the stretch IRA. The Secure Act requires the payout of the full plan balance at the end of the 10th year following the death of the plan holder. That will for many plans result in a very high tax rate of 42.6% on those plan balances. If the funds were instead distributed to a beneficiary, the marginal tax bracket might be only 22% or about half. That is a tremendous difference and will require careful consideration of naming trusts as beneficiaries. That creates a particularly nettlesome dilemma for you if you want the protection a trust can provide for a beneficiary but don’t want to incur potentially a doubled income tax rate.  This increase applies to tax years beginning after December 31, 2021. This suggests for high income taxpayers realizing income in the current year before this additional change may be worthwhile. Income earned this year will be taxed at 35% instead of 42.6%.  Modifications to AGI include a reduction for investment interest.  Sec. 138206 adding new Sec. 1A.  Increase in Capital Gains Rate  The Biden administration had proposed taxing capital gains at ordinary income rates for those taxpayers with adjusted gross income of $1 million or more. That would have meant a tax rate of 39.6%. So, while the House proposal would increase capital gains rates, the change is not as costly as that initially proposed. Capital gains rate will be increased from 20% to 25%. This results in a 25% increase from the prior rate.  This change applies to taxable years ending after the date of introduction of this Act. The current capital gains tax rate of 20% will apply to gains prior to the date of introduction. It may also apply to sales that occur at a later date but based on a legally binding contractual arrangement that was in existence before the date of introduction. So, if you contracted to sell your business in March 2021 and it closes in November 2021, that should be subject to a 20% rate. But final legislative language (if this change is enacted) should be reviewed to confirm how this transition rule actually applies. What is the date of introduction? That is not the date of enactment. Could that potentially mean September 13, 2021, when the House Ways and Means Committee released their proposals? This is an important example of an effective date prior to 2022. But this effective date possibly means you can no longer trigger capital gains at the favorable old rate. So, continued planning for lower capital gains rates may no longer be possible.  Sec. 138202 changing Sec. l(h)(l)(D).  Net Investment Income Tax (“NIIT”) Applies to Trade or Business Income  The NIIT tax had applied a 3.8% additional tax on certain investment income. The House proposal will substantial expanded this NIIT tax to apply to all business income for taxpayers with more than $500,000 of income on a joint return, $400,000 for a single individual. The NIIT tax is not assessed on earnings already subject to FICA tax.  The purpose of this change is to end a planning technique that many business owners had used. For example, a physician organized her practice as a S corporation. She earned profits of $1 million. She took $200,000 out as a salary subject to FICA tax and the remaining $800,000 she withdrew as S corporation distributions and avoided FICA Tax. Now, the $600,000 of profits over $400,000 will be subject to the 3.8% NIIT tax. Thus, the 3.8% tax will apply to distributions from S corporations, LLCs, and partnerships. This will eliminate the planning approach used by many of paying distributions from the pass through entity in lieu of higher salary. This change will eliminate the benefit that using an S corporation structure provided for some. So, some taxpayers may reassess the legal structure of their business entities if these changes are enacted. Since S corporations require special provisions in trust instruments (as only certain types of trusts are allowed to hold S corporation stock) those special provisions may no longer be necessary.  If there are buy sell agreements, valuations for buy out or other purposes, they may all have to be reassessed. For example, if the physician in the above example had a buyout agreement with her partner, she may have a formula for the buyout price pegged to profits. But if salary is now increased because there is no longer a benefit to making distributions instead of paying compensation, that formula may be affected. Addressing this will be important for estate planning purposes.  The change is to apply to tax years after December 31, 2021. This might suggest to some that the planning illustrated above remains viable until year end. While that may be the case, such planning is not assured as the IRS may still challenge the above on the basis of the taxpayer/owner not being paid sufficient or “reasonable” compensation.  Sec. 138203 changing Sec. 1411.  Section 199A Deduction of Qualified Business Income Restricted  This provision, enacted as part of the 2017 tax act (the Tax Cut and Jobs Act), provided a deduction of 20% of income for qualifying business income (“QBI”). That specifically excluded income earned by specified businesses such as law, medicine and others. There has been a perception that this provision provided a significant benefit to many high income business owners so that the proposal restricts that. The maximum deduction that will be permitted will be $500,000 for those filing a joint (married) income tax return and $400,000 for single taxpayers. Notably, for trusts and estates the maximum deduction is set at a mere $10,000.  This will substantially limit 199A deductions for wealthy taxpayers. The figure for trusts is incredibly harsh and will effectively eliminate the benefit for trust owned real estate and other trust owned qualifying business interests. Now you have to consider what happens when evaluating gifts to trusts of real estate rental or other business interests that would qualify for 199A deduction for qualified business income as those interests will now be subject to the severe $10,000 limitation.  This change will apply to tax years beginning after December 31, 2021.  Sec. 138204 modifying Sec. 199A.  Restrictions on Use of Business Losses  Under current law the tax code limits pass-through business net losses which can offset non-business income to $250,000 (or $500,000 for married taxpayers filing joint returns). This change, if enacted, will permanently disallow net business deductions in excess of business income for non-corporate taxpayers. You will still be able to carry losses that are disallowed to the next tax year. Thus, you will no longer be able to offset losses on one business by other losses/gains on another business.  This change will apply to tax years beginning after December 31, 2021.  Sec. 138205 amending Sec. 461(1)  Contribution Limit for Individual Retirement Plans of High-Income Taxpayers with Large Account Balances.  If your retirement plan balances exceed $10 million, and your income exceeds $450,000 (married filing jointly) you will be restricted on making contributions to regular IRAs, Roth IRAs and defined contribution plans. Also, if you have such large account balances you will be required to withdraw from your plans pursuant to new min"

End Further Info End Preamble Start Supplemental Information  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  I. Background  A. The Address Discrepancy Rule  The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (“FACT Act”) was signed into law on December 4, 2003. Public Law 108-159, 117 Stat. 1952. The FACT Act added section 605(h) to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”), which requires a national consumer reporting agency (“CRA”) that receives a request for a consumer report that contains an address substantially different from the address on file for the consumer to notify the requester of the existence of the discrepancy.[1]  Section 605(h) also required federal banking agencies, the National Credit Union Administration and the Commission to issue regulations providing guidance regarding reasonable policies and procedures that a user of a consumer report should employ when the user receives a notice of address discrepancy.[2]  In 2007, the agencies issued the Address Discrepancy Rule to satisfy this requirement.[3]  The Address Discrepancy Rule requires a user of consumer reports to develop and implement reasonable policies and procedures designed to enable the user to form a reasonable belief that a consumer report relates to the consumer about whom it has requested a consumer report, when the user receives a notice of address discrepancy.[4]  Users must also develop and implement reasonable policies and procedures for furnishing an address for the consumer that the user has reasonably confirmed as accurate to the CRA from whom it received the notice when the user (1) can confirm the consumer report relates to the consumer about whom the user requested the Start Printed Page 51818report, (2) establishes a continuing relationship with the consumer, and (3) regularly furnishes information about the consumer to the CRA.[5]  B. Dodd-Frank Act  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”) was signed into law in 2010.[6]  The Dodd-Frank Act substantially changed the federal legal framework for financial services providers. Among the changes, the Dodd-Frank Act transferred to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) the Commission's rulemaking authority under portions of the FCRA.[7]  Accordingly, in 2012, the Commission rescinded several of its FCRA rules, which had been replaced by rules issued by the CFPB.[8]  The FTC retains rulemaking authority for other rules promulgated under the FCRA to the extent the rules apply to motor vehicle dealers described in section 1029(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act [9]  predominantly engaged in the sale and servicing of motor vehicles, the leasing and servicing of motor vehicles, or both (“motor vehicle dealers”).[10]  The rules for which the FTC retains rulemaking authority include the Address Discrepancy Rule, which now applies only to consumer report users that are motor vehicle dealers.[11]  Consumer report users that are not motor vehicle dealers are covered by the CFPB's rule.[12]  II. Regulatory Review of the Address Discrepancy Rule  On September 15, 2020, the Commission solicited comments on the Address Discrepancy Rule as part of its periodic review of its rules and guides.[13]  The Commission sought information about the costs and benefits of the Rule, and its regulatory and economic impact. In addition, the Commission proposed to narrow the scope of the Address Discrepancy Rule to motor vehicle dealers excluded from Consumer Financial Protection Bureau jurisdiction as described in the Dodd-Frank Act.[14]  The Commission received one comment.[15]  III. Overview of Final Rule  The Commission adopted the Address Discrepancy Rule at a time when it had rulemaking authority for a broader group of consumer report users. While the Dodd-Frank Act did not change the Commission's enforcement authority for the Address Discrepancy Rule, it did narrow the Commission's rulemaking authority with respect to the Rule. It now covers only motor vehicle dealers.[16]  The amendments in the Dodd-Frank Act necessitate a technical revision to the Address Discrepancy Rule to ensure the regulation is consistent with the text of the amended FCRA. Accordingly, the Final Rule amends the Address Discrepancy Rule to properly reflect the Rule's scope.  The sole commenter on the Rule stated the Address Discrepancy Rule allowed him to discover a case of identity theft involving the misuse of his Social Security number, and argued the Rule should not be changed.[17]  The Commission agrees no changes other than those required by the Dodd-Frank Act are necessary and the Final Rule makes no further amendments to the existing Rule. Although the Commission is revising the scope of the Rule so it is consistent with the applicable statute, the protections provided to consumers will not change: Users of consumer reports have the same obligations with respect to address discrepancies under the CFPB's corresponding rule as under the FTC's rule.  IV. Paperwork Reduction Act  The Address Discrepancy Rule contains information collection requirements as defined by 5 CFR 1320.3(c), the definitional provision within the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”) regulations that implement the Paperwork Reduction Act (“PRA”). 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. OMB has approved the Rule's existing information collection requirements through December 31, 2021 (OMB Control No. 3084-0137).  The Final Rule amends 16 CFR part 641. The amendments do not modify or add to information collection requirements previously approved by OMB. The amendments do not make any substantive changes to the Rule, other than to narrow the scope to motor vehicle dealers. The existing clearance already reflects that change in scope.  Therefore, the Commission does not believe the amendments substantially or materially modify any “collections of information” as defined by the PRA.  V. Regulatory Flexibility Act  The Regulatory Flexibility Act (“RFA”), as amended by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, requires an agency to either provide an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (“IRFA”) with a proposed rule, or certify the proposed rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.[18]  The Commission published an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis in order to inquire into the impact of the proposed Rule on small entities.[19]  The Commission received no responsive comments.  The Commission does not believe these amendments have the threshold impact on small entities. The amendments effectuate changes to the Dodd-Frank Act and will not impose costs on small motor vehicle dealers because the amendments are for clarification purposes and will not result in any increased burden on any motor vehicle dealer. Thus, a small entity that complies with current law need not take any different or additional action under the Final Rule. Therefore, the Commission certifies the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small businesses.  Although the Commission certifies under the RFA the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities, and hereby provides notice of that certification to the Small Business Administration, the Commission nonetheless has determined that publishing a final regulatory flexibility analysis (“FRFA”) is appropriate to ensure the impact of the rule is fully addressed. Therefore, the Commission has prepared the following analysis:  A. Need for and Objectives of the Final Rule  To address the Dodd-Frank Act's changes to the Commission's rulemaking authority the amendments change the scope of the Rule. With this action, the Commission makes the current scope of the Rule clearer.Start Printed Page 51819  B. Significant Issues Raised in Public Comments in Response to the IRFA  The Commission did not receive any comments that addressed the burden on small entities. In addition, the Commission did not receive any comments filed by the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration (“SBA”).  C. Estimate of Number of Small Entities to Which the Final Rule Will Apply  The Commission anticipates many covered motor vehicle dealers may qualify as small businesses according to the applicable SBA size standards.[20]  As explained in the IRFA, however, determining a precise estimate of the number of small entities is not readily feasible. No commenters addressed this issue. Nonetheless, as discussed above, these amendments do not add any additional burdens on any covered small businesses.  D. Projected Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other Compliance Requirements, Including Classes of Covered Small Entities and Professional Skills Needed To Comply  The amendments do not impose any new reporting, recordkeeping, or other compliance requirements.  E. Description of Steps Taken To Minimize Significant Economic Impact, if Any, on Small Entities, Including Alternatives  The Commission did not propose any specific small entity exemption or other significant alternatives because the amendments will not increase reporting requirements and will not impose any new requirements or compliance costs.  VI. Other Matters  Pursuant to the Congressional Review Act (5 U.S.C. 801 et seq.), the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs designated this rule as not a “major rule,” as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2).

Section 312 of the FACT Act amended section 623 [1]  of the FCRA by requiring the FTC, with other agencies, to issue guidelines for use by furnishers regarding the accuracy and integrity of the information about consumers that they furnish to consumer reporting agencies (“CRAs”) and to prescribe regulations requiring furnishers to establish reasonable policies and procedures for implementing the guidelines. Section 312 also required the Commission and the other agencies to issue regulations identifying the circumstances under which a furnisher must reinvestigate direct consumer disputes concerning the accuracy of information provided by the furnisher to a CRA. On July 1, 2009, the Commission issued the Furnisher Rule and the accompanying guidelines that took effect on July 1, 2010.[2]  The Rule requires furnishers to establish and implement reasonable written policies and procedures regarding the accuracy and integrity of the information relating to consumers that they furnish to a CRA.[3]  The Rule also requires that furnishers respond to direct disputes from consumers.[4]  B. Dodd-Frank Act  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”) was signed into law in 2010.[5]  The Dodd-Frank Act substantially changed the federal legal framework for financial services providers. Among the changes, the Dodd-Frank Act transferred to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) the Commission's rulemaking authority under portions of the FCRA.[6]  Accordingly, in 2012, the Commission rescinded several of its FCRA rules, which had been replaced by rules issued by the CFPB.[7]  The FTC retained rulemaking authority for other rules to the extent the rules apply to motor vehicle dealers described in section 1029(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act [8]  predominantly engaged in the sale and servicing of motor vehicles, the leasing and servicing of motor vehicles, or both (“motor vehicle dealers”).[9]  The retained rules include the Furnisher Rule, which now applies only to motor vehicle dealers.[10]  Furnishers originally covered Start Printed Page 51820by the Furnisher Rule that are not motor vehicle dealers are covered by the CFPB's rule.[11]  The Commission continues to have authority to enforce the CFPB's rule and has brought several actions alleging violations of the rule.[12]  II. Regulatory Review of the Furnisher Rule  On September 30, 2020, the Commission solicited comments on the Furnisher Rule as part of its periodic review of its rules and guides. The Commission sought information about the costs and benefits of the Rule, and its regulatory and economic impact. In addition, the Commission proposed amending sections 660.1 and 660.2 to narrow the scope of the Furnisher Rule to motor vehicle dealers excluded from CFPB jurisdiction as described in the Dodd-Frank Act. The Commission received one comment stating that the Furnisher Rule assists millions of consumers to discover inaccuracies in their consumer reports and emphasizing the need for continued enforcement of the Rule.[13]  The Commission agrees with this commenter.  III. Overview of Final Rule  The Commission adopted the Furnisher Rule at a time when it had rulemaking authority for a broader group of consumer report users. While the Dodd-Frank Act did not change the Commission's enforcement authority for the Furnisher Rule, it did narrow the Commission's rulemaking authority with respect to the Rule. It now covers only motor vehicle dealers.[14]  The amendments in the Dodd-Frank Act necessitate technical revisions to the Furnisher Rule to ensure the regulation is consistent with the text of the amended FCRA. Accordingly, the Commission amends the Furnisher Rule to properly reflect the Rule's scope.  The amendment to section 660.1 narrows the scope of the Furnisher Rule to “motor vehicle dealers,” as defined in amended section 660.2.  The amendment to section 660.2 adds a definition of “motor vehicle dealer” that defines motor vehicle dealers as those entities excluded from CFPB jurisdiction as described in the Dodd-Frank Act.[15]  The amendments also change the definition of “identity theft” by replacing the Rule's reference to 16 CFR 603.2(a), a provision of an FTC rule that has since been rescinded,[16]  with a reference to 12 CFR 1022.3(h), the equivalent provision in the CFPB's rule. The amendments make no other substantive changes to the Rule.  IV. Paperwork Reduction Act  The Furnisher Rule contains information collection requirements as defined by 5 CFR 1320.3(c), the definitional provision within the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”) regulations that implement the Paperwork Reduction Act (“PRA”). 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. OMB has approved the Rule's existing information collection requirements through July 31, 2022 (OMB Control No. 3084-0144). Under the existing clearance, the FTC has attributed to itself the estimated burden regarding all motor vehicle dealers and then shares equally the remaining estimated PRA burden with the CFPB for other persons for which both agencies have enforcement authority regarding the Furnisher Rule.  The Final Rule amends 16 CFR part 660. The amendments do not modify or add to information collection requirements previously approved by OMB. The amendments narrow the scope to motor vehicle dealers. The Rule's OMB clearance already reflects that change. Therefore, the Commission does not believe the amendments substantially or materially modify any “collections of information” as defined by the PRA.  V. Regulatory Flexibility Act  The Regulatory Flexibility Act (“RFA”), as amended by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, requires an agency to either provide an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (“IRFA”) with a proposed rule, or certify that the proposed rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.[17]  The Commission published an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis in order to inquire into the impact of the proposed Rule on small entities.[18]  The Commission received no responsive comments.  The Commission does not believe these amendments have the threshold impact on small entities. The amendments effectuate changes to the Dodd-Frank Act and will not impose costs on small motor vehicle dealers because the amendments are for clarification purposes and will not result in any increased burden on any motor vehicle dealer. Thus, a small entity that complies with current law need not take any different or additional action under the Final Rule. Therefore, the Commission certifies that amending the Furnisher Rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small businesses.  Although the Commission certifies under the RFA the Final Rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities, and hereby provides notice of that certification to the Small Business Administration, the Commission nonetheless has determined that publishing a final regulatory flexibility analysis (“FRFA”) is appropriate to ensure the impact of the rule is fully addressed. Therefore, the Commission has prepared the following analysis:  A. Need for and Objectives of the Final Rule  To address the Dodd-Frank Act's changes to the Commission's rulemaking authority, the amendments clarify that the Rule applies only to motor vehicle dealers.  B. Significant Issues Raised in Public Comments in Response to the IRFA  The Commission did not receive any comments that addressed the burden on small entities. In addition, the Commission did not receive any comments filed by the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration (“SBA”).  C. Estimate of Number of Small Entities to Which the Final Rule Will Apply  The Commission anticipates many covered motor vehicle dealers may qualify as small businesses according to the applicable SBA size standards. As explained in the IRFA, however, determining a precise estimate of the number of small entities is not readily feasible. No commenters addressed this issue. Nonetheless, as discussed above, these amendments do not add any additional burdens on any covered small businesses.Start Printed Page 51821  D. Projected Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other Compliance Requirements, Including Classes of Covered Small Entities and Professional Skills Needed To Comply  The amendments impose no new reporting, recordkeeping, or other compliance requirements.  E. Description of Steps Taken To Minimize Significant Economic Impact, if Any, on Small Entities, Including Alternatives  The Commission did not propose any specific small entity exemption or other significant alternatives because the amendments will not increase reporting requirements and will not impose any new requirements or compliance costs.  VI. Other Matters  Pursuant to the Congressional Review Act (5 U.S.C. 801 et seq.), the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs designated this rule as not a “major rule,” as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2).

Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board,34-93043 | Kenneth G. Friedrich,US SEC | Latest Administrative Proceedings Active,US Securities and Exchange Commission,"34-93043 | Kenneth G. Friedrich  UNITED STATES OF AMERICA   Before the   SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION   SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934   Release No. 93043 / September 17, 2021   ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING   File No. 3-20569   In the Matter of   Kenneth G. Friedrich,   Respondent.   ORDER INSTITUTING   ADMINISTRATIVE AND CEASE-AND-  DESIST PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO   SECTIONS 15(b), 15B(c) AND 21C OF   THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF   1934, MAKING FINDINGS, AND   IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS   AND A CEASE-AND-DESIST ORDER   I.   The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate and in the   public interest that public administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are,   instituted pursuant to Sections 15(b), 15B(c) and 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934   (“Exchange Act”) against Kenneth G. Friedrich (“Friedrich” or “Respondent”).     II.    In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer   of Settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the   purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the   Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings   herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of these   proceedings, which are admitted, and except as provided herein in Section V, Respondent consents   to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to   Sections 15(b), 15B(c) and 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 9(b) of the   Investment Company Act of 1940, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a   Cease-and-Desist Order (“Order”), as set forth below.     III.    On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds  1    that:   Summary   This matter involves improper conduct by Friedrich in connection with RBC Capital   Markets, LLC’s (“RBC”) purchase and sale of certain new issue municipal bonds from and to   unregistered brokers known as “flippers.”  Friedrich served as Head of RBC’s Municipal Sales,   Trading and Syndication group (the “Municipal Group”) from 2010 to June 2016.     RBC’s internal policy for primary offerings required the firm’s syndicate desk, when acting   as sole underwriter or senior syndicate manager, to allocate bonds according to a “standard   methodology” that prioritized customer and dealer orders over orders for flippers absent different   instructions from issuers.  However, between January 2014 and December 2017, the syndicate desk   did not always follow the standard methodology, instead sometimes filling orders for flippers ahead   and instead of institutional customer and dealer orders when orders exceeded the bonds available.    In connection with one November 2015 offering where the issuer directed a retail order period, the   syndicate desk also allocated some bonds to two flippers ahead and instead of retail customers   although the flippers did not meet the issuer’s retail eligibility criteria.  From at least January 2014   to June 2016, Friedrich was aware that the syndicate desk did not always follow the standard   methodology and he permitted the underwriters on the syndicate desk to fill orders for flippers   ahead and instead of customer and dealer orders.  He also participated in the decision to allocate   bonds to flippers in the November 2015 offering.     Between January 2014 and December 2017, RBC also used flippers to circumvent issuer   priority instructions and receive higher priority for its dealer orders in some instances when RBC   was not a participating underwriter in the offering.  From at least January 2014 to June 2016,   Friedrich permitted RBC traders to place orders for new issue bonds with flippers.  He was aware   that the flippers sometimes placed purported “customer” orders with the underwriters and, when   allocated bonds, sold the bonds to RBC.     As a result of this conduct, Friedrich violated Section 15B(c)(1) of the Exchange Act and   Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (“MSRB”) Rules G-11(k) and G-17.  He also violated   MSRB Rule G-27, and failed reasonably to supervise within the meaning of Section 15(b)(4)(E)   of the Exchange Act, with a view to preventing and detecting violations of MSRB Rules G-11(k)   and G-17 by a certain registered representative.   Respondent   1.    Kenneth G. Friedrich  , age 57, resides in New York, New York.  From January   1999 to June 2016, Friedrich was a registered representative associated with RBC.  From 2007 to   1    The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondent’s Offer of Settlement and are not binding on any other   person or entity in this or any other proceeding.     2010, he served as Head of RBC’s sales desk in the Municipal Group and, from 2010 to June 2016,   he served as Head of the Municipal Group.     Relevant Entities   2.    RBC Capital Markets, LLC  , incorporated in Minnesota with a principal place of   business in New York, New York, is registered with the Commission as a broker-dealer,   municipal securities dealer, investment adviser and municipal advisor.        3.    RMR Asset Management Company (“RMR”)  , was a California corporation   with a principal place of business in Chula Vista, California.  RMR primarily bought and sold   new issue bonds.  RMR was not registered with the Commission.  The Commission filed an   enforcement action against RMR and its associates in August 2018.  2  4.    Core Performance Management, LLC (“CPM”)   was a Florida limited liability   company located in Boca Raton, Florida that was dissolved on July 27, 2016.  CPM primarily   bought and sold new issue municipal bonds.  CPM was not registered with the Commission.  The   Commission filed an enforcement action against CPM and its associates in August 2018.  3  Background on Municipal Underwriting Process   5.  Municipalities often raise money by issuing bonds that are sold to the public   through an underwriting process.  In what is known as a “negotiated” offering, the municipal   issuer chooses a broker-dealer to act either as sole underwriter or as the senior manager of an   underwriting syndicate.  An underwriting syndicate is a group of broker-dealers that join together   to purchase new issue bonds from the issuer to distribute the bonds to the public.     6.  Negotiated offerings of new issue municipal bonds are conducted according to   certain rules, including the “priority of orders,” which establishes the sequence in which bonds   will be allocated to specific types of orders.  Issuer priority rules typically assign retail customer   orders the highest priority in the bond allocation process.  Issuers generally prioritize customer   orders ahead of orders for broker-dealers seeking bonds for their own inventory, and as a result   such orders are often not filled.     2    SEC v. RMR Asset Management Company, et al.  , 18-CV-01895-AJB-JMA (S.D. Cal. filed Aug. 14, 2018)   (partially settled action against RMR and 13 associated individuals for acting as unregistered brokers and, as to 10 of   them, for engaging in fraudulent practices in connection with flipping new issue municipal bonds).  In August 2020,   the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California granted summary judgment to the SEC, finding that   the three non-settling RMR associates acted as unregistered brokers in violation of Section 15(a) of the Exchange   Act when they engaged in thousands of securities transactions for RMR.    3    SEC v. Core Performance Management, LLC, et al.  , 18-CV-81081-BB (S.D. Fla., filed Aug. 14, 2018) (settled   action against CPM and five associated individuals for acting as unregistered brokers and for engaging in fraudulent   practices in connection with flipping new issue municipal bonds).   RBC’s Standard Methodology for Allocating Bonds in Primary Offerings   7.  Between January 2014 and December 2017, RBC had a written internal policy   (the “Policy”) relating to new issue municipal bond offerings.  The Policy established procedures   that RBC’s syndicate desk was to follow when RBC was acting as sole underwriter or senior   syndicate manager.  In the absence of different priority instructions from issuers, flippers were to   receive the lowest priority.  Specifically, the Policy required RBC’s syndicate desk to adhere to a   “standard methodology,” and prioritize orders and allocate bonds as follows:   ●    1  st    priority: Orders for Customers   ●    2  nd    priority: Orders for [RBC’s] own account, [RBC] related accounts or [RBC]   affiliated accounts (or syndicate member’s own, related or affiliated accounts, if   applicable)   ●    3  rd    priority: Orders for Broker-Dealers other than [RBC] and syndicate members   ●    4  th    priority: Any other orders   8.  The Policy defined “Customer” orders entitled to first priority under the standard   methodology to “generally include all orders received by or on behalf of an individual or   institution other than 2  nd  , 3  rd    and 4  th    priority.”  Orders that had last, or fourth, priority were   defined as “[any] other orders, including orders such as those submitted by a customer who, in   the reasonable belief of [RBC] plans to purchase the securities and immediately resell such   securities at higher prices (known as a “flipper”) or instances in which [RBC] is unable to   reasonably authenticate the status or qualification of an order during a retail order period directed   by an Issuer.”   9.  Pursuant to the Policy, in advance of each negotiated offering where RBC’s   syndicate desk acted as sole underwriter or senior syndicate manager, RBC provided issuers a   written notice titled “Notice of Priority of Orders from and Allocations to Investors” (the   “Notices”).  The Notices described the standard methodology, and they stated that RBC would   “deviate from such priority only when deemed by [RBC] to be in the best interests of the   syndicate or unless the Issuer otherwise consents.”   10.  The Policy further required RBC’s syndicate desk to document any and all   deviations from established priority provisions, as well as the reasons for the deviations, and to   keep that documentation and any issuer instructions in the firm’s underwriting files.   Friedrich Permitted the Improper Allocation of New Issue Bonds to Flippers   11.  In 2008, Friedrich, as Head of Sales, appointed a single institutional salesperson   to cover certain of RBC’s accounts for RMR, CPM and their affiliates (collectively, “the   flippers”).  As a result of this structure, all of RBC’s municipal bond transactions with flippers   were coordinated through the salesperson responsible for covering the flippers’ accounts.       12.  When serving as sole underwriter or senior syndicate manager, RBC’s syndicate   desk did not always adhere to the standard methodology in the Policy and the Notices, in the   absence of different priority instructions from issuers.  Instead, on at least 41 occasions when   orders exceeded the new issue bonds available, the syndicate desk prioritized orders for flippers   over orders for institutional customer and dealer orders.  As a result, the flippers orders’   “crowded out” institutional customer and/or dealer orders which should have been filled first.    Further, RBC’s syndicate desk failed to document these deviations from the standard   methodology or the reasons for them.  Friedrich knew that the syndicate desk did not always   follow the standard methodology in the absence of different instructions from issuers, and he   permitted the Head of the RBC syndicate desk (the “Syndicate Manager”) and the other   underwriters on the syndicate desk to sometimes allocate bonds to the flippers ahead and instead of   customers and dealers.    13.  For example, in March 2016, RBC served as senior manager for a negotiated   offering of municipal bonds in the total principal amount of $62.2 million.  In connection with   the offering, the salesperson who Friedrich assigned to cover the flipper accounts submitted four   orders for three different bond maturities on behalf of RMR and two CPM affiliates.  Orders for   the three bond maturities exceeded the available bonds by between 19% and 77%.  Despite this,   RBC’s syndicate desk allocated a combined $1.1 million in the three bond maturities to RMR   and the CPM affiliates.  As a result, approximately $7.9 million in institutional customer orders   and approximately $7.8 million in dealer orders were not filled.   14.  In one offering during the relevant period, the syndicate desk also allocated   oversubscribed bonds to the flippers ahead and instead of retail customers in contravention of the   issuer’s priority instructions.  In November 2015, RBC acted as senior syndicate manager for a   negotiated offering of municipal bonds in the total principal amount of $626.8 million.  The   issuer directed that a retail order period be held in which first priority was to be given to retail   customer orders.  Shortly before the retail order period closed, the salesperson who Friedrich   assigned to cover the flippers submitted two orders for RMR and an order for a CPM affiliate to   the syndicate desk.  The salesperson falsely certified that the orders met the issuer’s retail   eligibility criteria and affirmed their eligibility by providing zip codes that were not associated   with the flippers’ locations.  Friedrich and the Syndicate Manager participated in the decision to   allocate bonds to the flippers in this offering.  Although Friedrich and the Syndicate Manager,   who directly managed the offering, were aware that the flippers were not retail customers and   that the flippers did not meet the issuer’s retail eligibility criteria, the syndicate desk allocated   $500,000 in bonds of one maturity to RMR and $1,000,000 and $250,000 in bonds of another   maturity to RMR and the CPM affiliate, respectively.  As a result, retail orders from other buyers   for these maturities were not filled.     15.  Friedrich permitted the syndicate desk to deviate from the standard methodology   because he understood that RBC benefitted from its relationships with the flippers, who often   purchased new issue bonds from RBC in deals where there were not enough other buyers for the   bonds.     Friedrich Permitted the Improper Purchase of New Issue Bonds from Flippers   16.  When acquiring new issue municipal bonds for inventory, broker-dealers are   required to submit dealer orders directly to the underwriters offering the bonds.  From at least   January 2014 to June 2016, Friedrich permitted RBC traders to use flippers to circumvent this   requirement and obtain higher priority for RBC’s orders in offerings in which the firm was not a   participating underwriter.  When RBC’s trading desk wanted new issue bonds for inventory, the   traders directed the salesperson Friedrich assigned to cover the flippers to place indications of   interest in purchasing the bonds with the flippers.  Friedrich was aware that the flippers   sometimes attempted to fill the indications they received from RBC by placing customer orders,   which had higher priority than dealer orders, with the underwriters.  He also was aware that,   when the flippers obtained bonds from the underwriters, they immediately sold or “flipped” the   bonds to RBC.  Between January 2014 and December 2017, RBC improperly obtained bonds for   inventory from flippers on at least 87 occasions.               Friedrich Failed Reasonably to Supervise the Syndicate Manager   17.  Between January 2014 and June 2016, Friedrich was the first-level supervisor of   RBC’s Syndicate Man"

An underwriting syndicate is a group of broker-dealers that join together   to purchase new issue bonds from the issuer to distribute the bonds to the public.     6.  Negotiated offerings of new issue municipal bonds are conducted according to   certain rules, including the “priority of orders,” which establishes the sequence in which bonds   will be allocated to specific types of orders.  Issuer priority rules typically assign retail customer   orders the highest priority in the bond allocation process.  Issuers generally prioritize customer   orders ahead of orders for broker-dealers seeking bonds for their own inventory, and as a result   such orders are often not filled.     2    SEC v. RMR Asset Management Company, et al.  , 18-CV-01895-AJB-JMA (S.D. Cal. filed Aug. 14, 2018)   (partially settled action against RMR and 13 associated individuals for acting as unregistered brokers and, as to 10 of   them, for engaging in fraudulent practices in connection with flipping new issue municipal bonds).  In August 2020,   the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California granted summary judgment to the SEC, finding that   the three non-settling RMR associates acted as unregistered brokers in violation of Section 15(a) of the Exchange   Act when they engaged in thousands of securities transactions for RMR.    3    SEC v. Core Performance Management, LLC, et al.  , 18-CV-81081-BB (S.D. Fla., filed Aug. 14, 2018) (settled   action against CPM and five associated individuals for acting as unregistered brokers and for engaging in fraudulent   practices in connection with flipping new issue municipal bonds).   RBC’s Standard Methodology for Allocating Bonds in Primary Offerings   7.  Between January 2014 and December 2017, RBC had a written internal policy   (the “Policy”) relating to new issue municipal bond offerings.  The Policy established procedures   that RBC’s syndicate desk was to follow when RBC was acting as sole underwriter or senior   syndicate manager.  In the absence of different priority instructions from issuers, flippers were to   receive the lowest priority.  Specifically, the Policy required RBC’s syndicate desk to adhere to a   “standard methodology,” and prioritize orders and allocate bonds as follows:   ●    1  st    priority: Orders for Customers   ●    2  nd    priority: Orders for [RBC’s] own account, [RBC] related accounts or [RBC]   affiliated accounts (or syndicate member’s own, related or affiliated accounts, if   applicable)   ●    3  rd    priority: Orders for Broker-Dealers other than [RBC] and syndicate members   ●    4  th    priority: Any other orders   8.  The Policy defined “Customer” orders entitled to first priority under the standard   methodology to “generally include all orders received by or on behalf of an individual or   institution other than 2  nd  , 3  rd    and 4  th    priority.”  Orders that had last, or fourth, priority were   defined as “[any] other orders, including orders such as those submitted by a customer who, in   the reasonable belief of [RBC] plans to purchase the securities and immediately resell such   securities at higher prices (known as a “flipper”) or instances in which [RBC] is unable to   reasonably authenticate the status or qualification of an order during a retail order period directed   by an Issuer.”   9.  Pursuant to the Policy, in advance of each negotiated offering where RBC’s   syndicate desk acted as sole underwriter or senior syndicate manager, RBC provided issuers a   written notice titled “Notice of Priority of Orders from and Allocations to Investors” (the   “Notices”).  The Notices described the standard methodology, and they stated that RBC would   “deviate from such priority only when deemed by [RBC] to be in the best interests of the   syndicate or unless the Issuer otherwise consents.”   10.  The Policy further required RBC’s syndicate desk to document any and all   deviations from established priority provisions, as well as the reasons for the deviations, and to   keep that documentation and any issuer instructions in the firm’s underwriting files.   Friedrich Permitted the Improper Allocation of New Issue Bonds to Flippers   11.  In 2008, Friedrich, as Head of Sales, appointed a single institutional salesperson   to cover certain of RBC’s accounts for RMR, CPM and their affiliates (collectively, “the   flippers”).  As a result of this structure, all of RBC’s municipal bond transactions with flippers   were coordinated through the salesperson responsible for covering the flippers’ accounts.       12.  When serving as sole underwriter or senior syndicate manager, RBC’s syndicate   desk did not always adhere to the standard methodology in the Policy and the Notices, in the   absence of different priority instructions from issuers.  Instead, on at least 41 occasions when   orders exceeded the new issue bonds available, the syndicate desk prioritized orders for flippers   over orders for institutional customer and dealer orders.  As a result, the flippers orders’   “crowded out” institutional customer and/or dealer orders which should have been filled first.    Further, RBC’s syndicate desk failed to document these deviations from the standard   methodology or the reasons for them.  Friedrich knew that the syndicate desk did not always   follow the standard methodology in the absence of different instructions from issuers, and he   permitted the Head of the RBC syndicate desk (the “Syndicate Manager”) and the other   underwriters on the syndicate desk to sometimes allocate bonds to the flippers ahead and instead of   customers and dealers.    13.  For example, in March 2016, RBC served as senior manager for a negotiated   offering of municipal bonds in the total principal amount of $62.2 million.  In connection with   the offering, the salesperson who Friedrich assigned to cover the flipper accounts submitted four   orders for three different bond maturities on behalf of RMR and two CPM affiliates.  Orders for   the three bond maturities exceeded the available bonds by between 19% and 77%.  Despite this,   RBC’s syndicate desk allocated a combined $1.1 million in the three bond maturities to RMR   and the CPM affiliates.  As a result, approximately $7.9 million in institutional customer orders   and approximately $7.8 million in dealer orders were not filled.   14.  In one offering during the relevant period, the syndicate desk also allocated   oversubscribed bonds to the flippers ahead and instead of retail customers in contravention of the   issuer’s priority instructions.  In November 2015, RBC acted as senior syndicate manager for a   negotiated offering of municipal bonds in the total principal amount of $626.8 million.  The   issuer directed that a retail order period be held in which first priority was to be given to retail   customer orders.  Shortly before the retail order period closed, the salesperson who Friedrich   assigned to cover the flippers submitted two orders for RMR and an order for a CPM affiliate to   the syndicate desk.  The salesperson falsely certified that the orders met the issuer’s retail   eligibility criteria and affirmed their eligibility by providing zip codes that were not associated   with the flippers’ locations.  Friedrich and the Syndicate Manager participated in the decision to   allocate bonds to the flippers in this offering.  Although Friedrich and the Syndicate Manager,   who directly managed the offering, were aware that the flippers were not retail customers and   that the flippers did not meet the issuer’s retail eligibility criteria, the syndicate desk allocated   $500,000 in bonds of one maturity to RMR and $1,000,000 and $250,000 in bonds of another   maturity to RMR and the CPM affiliate, respectively.  As a result, retail orders from other buyers   for these maturities were not filled.     15.  Friedrich permitted the syndicate desk to deviate from the standard methodology   because he understood that RBC benefitted from its relationships with the flippers, who often   purchased new issue bonds from RBC in deals where there were not enough other buyers for the   bonds.     Friedrich Permitted the Improper Purchase of New Issue Bonds from Flippers   16.  When acquiring new issue municipal bonds for inventory, broker-dealers are   required to submit dealer orders directly to the underwriters offering the bonds.  From at least   January 2014 to June 2016, Friedrich permitted RBC traders to use flippers to circumvent this   requirement and obtain higher priority for RBC’s orders in offerings in which the firm was not a   participating underwriter.  When RBC’s trading desk wanted new issue bonds for inventory, the   traders directed the salesperson Friedrich assigned to cover the flippers to place indications of   interest in purchasing the bonds with the flippers.  Friedrich was aware that the flippers   sometimes attempted to fill the indications they received from RBC by placing customer orders,   which had higher priority than dealer orders, with the underwriters.  He also was aware that,   when the flippers obtained bonds from the underwriters, they immediately sold or “flipped” the   bonds to RBC.  Between January 2014 and December 2017, RBC improperly obtained bonds for   inventory from flipp"

Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board,Kenneth G. Friedrich,US SEC | What's New Today,US Securities and Exchange Commission,"Kenneth G. Friedrich  UNITED STATES OF AMERICA   Before the   SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION   SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934   Release No. 93043 / September 17, 2021   ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING   File No. 3-20569   In the Matter of   Kenneth G. Friedrich,   Respondent.   ORDER INSTITUTING   ADMINISTRATIVE AND CEASE-AND-  DESIST PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO   SECTIONS 15(b), 15B(c) AND 21C OF   THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF   1934, MAKING FINDINGS, AND   IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS   AND A CEASE-AND-DESIST ORDER   I.   The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate and in the   public interest that public administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are,   instituted pursuant to Sections 15(b), 15B(c) and 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934   (“Exchange Act”) against Kenneth G. Friedrich (“Friedrich” or “Respondent”).     II.    In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer   of Settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the   purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the   Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings   herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of these   proceedings, which are admitted, and except as provided herein in Section V, Respondent consents   to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to   Sections 15(b), 15B(c) and 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 9(b) of the   Investment Company Act of 1940, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a   Cease-and-Desist Order (“Order”), as set forth below.     III.    On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds  1    that:   Summary   This matter involves improper conduct by Friedrich in connection with RBC Capital   Markets, LLC’s (“RBC”) purchase and sale of certain new issue municipal bonds from and to   unregistered brokers known as “flippers.”  Friedrich served as Head of RBC’s Municipal Sales,   Trading and Syndication group (the “Municipal Group”) from 2010 to June 2016.     RBC’s internal policy for primary offerings required the firm’s syndicate desk, when acting   as sole underwriter or senior syndicate manager, to allocate bonds according to a “standard   methodology” that prioritized customer and dealer orders over orders for flippers absent different   instructions from issuers.  However, between January 2014 and December 2017, the syndicate desk   did not always follow the standard methodology, instead sometimes filling orders for flippers ahead   and instead of institutional customer and dealer orders when orders exceeded the bonds available.    In connection with one November 2015 offering where the issuer directed a retail order period, the   syndicate desk also allocated some bonds to two flippers ahead and instead of retail customers   although the flippers did not meet the issuer’s retail eligibility criteria.  From at least January 2014   to June 2016, Friedrich was aware that the syndicate desk did not always follow the standard   methodology and he permitted the underwriters on the syndicate desk to fill orders for flippers   ahead and instead of customer and dealer orders.  He also participated in the decision to allocate   bonds to flippers in the November 2015 offering.     Between January 2014 and December 2017, RBC also used flippers to circumvent issuer   priority instructions and receive higher priority for its dealer orders in some instances when RBC   was not a participating underwriter in the offering.  From at least January 2014 to June 2016,   Friedrich permitted RBC traders to place orders for new issue bonds with flippers.  He was aware   that the flippers sometimes placed purported “customer” orders with the underwriters and, when   allocated bonds, sold the bonds to RBC.     As a result of this conduct, Friedrich violated Section 15B(c)(1) of the Exchange Act and   Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (“MSRB”) Rules G-11(k) and G-17.  He also violated   MSRB Rule G-27, and failed reasonably to supervise within the meaning of Section 15(b)(4)(E)   of the Exchange Act, with a view to preventing and detecting violations of MSRB Rules G-11(k)   and G-17 by a certain registered representative.   Respondent   1.    Kenneth G. Friedrich  , age 57, resides in New York, New York.  From January   1999 to June 2016, Friedrich was a registered representative associated with RBC.  From 2007 to   1    The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondent’s Offer of Settlement and are not binding on any other   person or entity in this or any other proceeding.     2010, he served as Head of RBC’s sales desk in the Municipal Group and, from 2010 to June 2016,   he served as Head of the Municipal Group.     Relevant Entities   2.    RBC Capital Markets, LLC  , incorporated in Minnesota with a principal place of   business in New York, New York, is registered with the Commission as a broker-dealer,   municipal securities dealer, investment adviser and municipal advisor.        3.    RMR Asset Management Company (“RMR”)  , was a California corporation   with a principal place of business in Chula Vista, California.  RMR primarily bought and sold   new issue bonds.  RMR was not registered with the Commission.  The Commission filed an   enforcement action against RMR and its associates in August 2018.  2  4.    Core Performance Management, LLC (“CPM”)   was a Florida limited liability   company located in Boca Raton, Florida that was dissolved on July 27, 2016.  CPM primarily   bought and sold new issue municipal bonds.  CPM was not registered with the Commission.  The   Commission filed an enforcement action against CPM and its associates in August 2018.  3  Background on Municipal Underwriting Process   5.  Municipalities often raise money by issuing bonds that are sold to the public   through an underwriting process.  In what is known as a “negotiated” offering, the municipal   issuer chooses a broker-dealer to act either as sole underwriter or as the senior manager of an   underwriting syndicate.  An underwriting syndicate is a group of broker-dealers that join together   to purchase new issue bonds from the issuer to distribute the bonds to the public.     6.  Negotiated offerings of new issue municipal bonds are conducted according to   certain rules, including the “priority of orders,” which establishes the sequence in which bonds   will be allocated to specific types of orders.  Issuer priority rules typically assign retail customer   orders the highest priority in the bond allocation process.  Issuers generally prioritize customer   orders ahead of orders for broker-dealers seeking bonds for their own inventory, and as a result   such orders are often not filled.     2    SEC v. RMR Asset Management Company, et al.  , 18-CV-01895-AJB-JMA (S.D. Cal. filed Aug. 14, 2018)   (partially settled action against RMR and 13 associated individuals for acting as unregistered brokers and, as to 10 of   them, for engaging in fraudulent practices in connection with flipping new issue municipal bonds).  In August 2020,   the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California granted summary judgment to the SEC, finding that   the three non-settling RMR associates acted as unregistered brokers in violation of Section 15(a) of the Exchange   Act when they engaged in thousands of securities transactions for RMR.    3    SEC v. Core Performance Management, LLC, et al.  , 18-CV-81081-BB (S.D.

RBC’s Standard Methodology for Allocating Bonds in Primary Offerings   7.  Between January 2014 and December 2017, RBC had a written internal policy   (the “Policy”) relating to new issue municipal bond offerings.  The Policy established procedures   that RBC’s syndicate desk was to follow when RBC was acting as sole underwriter or senior   syndicate manager.

Specifically, the Policy required RBC’s syndicate desk to adhere to a   “standard methodology,” and prioritize orders and allocate bonds as follows:   ●    1  st    priority: Orders for Customers   ●    2  nd    priority: Orders for [RBC’s] own account, [RBC] related accounts or [RBC]   affiliated accounts (or syndicate member’s own, related or affiliated accounts, if   applicable)   ●    3  rd    priority: Orders for Broker-Dealers other than [RBC] and syndicate members   ●    4  th    priority: Any other orders   8.  The Policy defined “Customer” orders entitled to first priority under the standard   methodology to “generally include all orders received by or on behalf of an individual or   institution other than 2  nd  , 3  rd    and 4  th    priority.”  Orders that had last, or fourth, priority were   defined as “[any] other orders, including orders such as those submitted by a customer who, in   the reasonable belief of [RBC] plans to purchase the securities and immediately resell such   securities at higher prices (known as a “flipper”) or instances in which [RBC] is unable to   reasonably authenticate the status or qualification of an order during a retail order period directed   by an Issuer.”   9.  Pursuant to the Policy, in advance of each negotiated offering where RBC’s   syndicate desk acted as sole underwriter or senior syndicate manager, RBC provided issuers a   written notice titled “Notice of Priority of Orders from and Allocations to Investors” (the   “Notices”).  The Notices described the standard methodology, and they stated that RBC would   “deviate from such priority only when deemed by [RBC] to be in the best interests of the   syndicate or unless the Issuer otherwise consents.”   10.  The Policy further required RBC’s syndicate desk to document any and all   deviations from established priority provisions, as well as the reasons for the deviations, and to   keep that documentation and any issuer instructions in the firm’s underwriting files.   Friedrich Permitted the Improper Allocation of New Issue Bonds to Flippers   11.  In 2008, Friedrich, as Head of Sales, appointed a single institutional salesperson   to cover certain of RBC’s accounts for RMR, CPM and their affiliates (collectively, “the   flippers”).  As a result of this structure, all of RBC’s municipal bond transactions with flippers   were coordinated through the salesperson responsible for covering the flippers’ accounts.       12.  When serving as sole underwriter or senior syndicate manager, RBC’s syndicate   desk did not always adhere to the standard methodology in the Policy and the Notices, in the   absence of different priority instructions from issuers.  Instead, on at least 41 occasions when   orders exceeded the new issue bonds available, the syndicate desk prioritized orders for flippers   over orders for institutional customer and dealer orders.  As a result, the flippers orders’   “crowded out” institutional customer and/or dealer orders which should have been filled first.

The salesperson falsely certified that the orders met the issuer’s retail   eligibility criteria and affirmed their eligibility by providing zip codes that were not associated   with the flippers’ locations.  Friedrich and the Syndicate Manager participated in the decision to   allocate bonds to the flippers in this offering.  Although Friedrich and the Syndicate Manager,   who directly managed the offering, were aware that the flippers were not retail customers and   that the flippers did not meet the issuer’s retail eligibility criteria, the syndicate desk allocated   $500,000 in bonds of one maturity to RMR and $1,000,000 and $250,000 in bonds of another   maturity to RMR and the CPM affiliate, respectively.  As a result, retail orders from other buyers   for these maturities were not filled.     15.  Friedrich permitted the syndicate desk to deviate from the standard methodology   because he understood that RBC benefitted from its relationships with the flippers, who often   purchased new issue bonds from RBC in deals where there were not enough other buyers for the   bonds.     Friedrich Permitted the Improper Purchase of New Issue Bonds from Flippers   16.  When acquiring new issue municipal bonds for inventory, broker-dealers are   required to submit dealer orders directly to the underwriters offering the bonds.  From at least   January 2014 to June 2016, Friedrich permitted RBC traders to use flippers to circumvent this   requirement and obtain higher priority for RBC’s orders in offerings in which the firm was not a   participating underwriter.  When RBC’s trading desk wanted new issue bonds for inventory, the   traders directed the salesperson Friedrich assigned to cover the flippers to place indications of   interest in purchasing the bonds with the flippers.  Friedrich was aware that the flippers   sometimes attempted to fill the indications they received from RBC by placing customer orders,   which had higher priority than dealer orders, with the underwriters.  He also was aware that,   when the flippers obtained bonds from the underwriters, they immediately sold or “flipped” the   bonds to RBC.  Between January 2014 and December 2017, RBC improperly obtained bonds for   inventory from flippers on at least 87 occasions.               Friedrich Failed Reasonably to Supervise the Syndicate Manager   17.  Between January 2014 and June 2016, Friedrich was the first-level supervisor of   RBC’s Syndicate Manager.  Frie"

The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate and in the   public interest that public administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are,   instituted pursuant to Sections 15(b), 15B(c) and 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934   (“Exchange Act”) against RBC Capital Markets, LLC (“RBC” or “Respondent”).    II.    In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer   of Settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the   purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the   Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings   herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over it and the subject matter of these   proceedings, which are admitted, Respondent consents to the entry of this Order Instituting   Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 15(b), 15B(c) and 21C of   the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a   Cease-and-Desist Order (“Order”), as set forth below.     III.    On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds  1    that:   Summary   This matter involves improper conduct by RBC in connection with certain negotiated new   issue municipal bond offerings.  Between January 2014 and December 2017 (“the relevant period”),   RBC, when acting as sole underwriter or senior syndicate manager in negotiated offerings,   undertook to allocate bonds according to an internal “standard methodology,” in the absence of   different instructions from issuers.  The firm’s standard methodology required RBC to fill all orders   for customers and all dealer orders for RBC, syndicate members and other broker-dealers before   allocating bonds to unregistered brokers known as “flippers.”  However, RBC did not always follow   the standard methodology when it did not have priority instructions from issuers and, in forty-one   instances when orders exceeded the bonds available, it failed to prioritize institutional customer   and/or dealer orders ahead of flipper orders.  Further, in three instances where it had issuer   instructions, RBC violated those instructions by allocating bonds to flippers ahead of orders for   retail customers even though it knew that the flippers’ orders did not meet the issuer’s retail   eligibility criteria for the offering.  Moreover, in certain offerings in which it was not a participating   underwriter,  RBC obtained new issue municipal bonds for the firm’s own inventory by placing   indications of interest with flippers who then placed customer orders with underwriters, instead of   RBC submitting dealer orders to the underwriters.  Through this practice, RBC caused the flippers   to act as unregistered brokers and circumvented issuer order priorities, improperly receiving higher   priority in those offerings.     As a result of this conduct, RBC violated Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board   (“MSRB”) Rules G-11(k) and G-17.  In addition, RBC violated MSRB Rule G-27, and failed   reasonably to supervise, within the meaning of Section 15(b)(4)(E) of the Exchange Act with a   view to preventing and detecting violations of the MSRB Rules G-11(k) and G-17 by certain   registered representatives.  RBC also violated Section 15B(c)(1) of the Exchange Act and caused   violations of Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act.    Respondent   1.    RBC Capital Markets, LLC  , incorporated in Minnesota and headquartered in New   York, New York, is registered with the Commission as a broker-dealer, municipal securities dealer,   investment adviser and municipal advisor.    Other Relevant Entities   2.    RMR Asset Management Company (“RMR”)   was a California corporation   with a principal place of business in Chula Vista, California.  RMR primarily bought and sold   1    The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondent’s Offer of Settlement and are not binding on any other   person or entity in this or any other proceeding.     new issue bonds.  RMR was not registered with the Commission.  The Commission filed an   enforcement action against RMR and its associates in August 2018.  2  3.    Core Performance Management, LLC (“CPM”)   was a Florida limited liability   company located in Boca Raton, Florida that was dissolved on July 27, 2016.  During the   relevant period, CPM primarily bought and sold new issue municipal bonds.  CPM was not   registered with the Commission.  The Commission filed an enforcement action against CPM and   its associates in August 2018.  3  Background on Municipal Underwriting Process   4.  Municipalities often raise money by issuing bonds that are sold to the public   through an underwriting process.  In what is known as a “negotiated” offering, the municipal   issuer chooses a broker-dealer to act either as sole underwriter or as the senior manager of an   underwriting syndicate.  An underwriting syndicate is a group of broker-dealers that join together   to purchase new issue bonds from the issuer to distribute the bonds to the public.      5.  Negotiated offerings of new issue municipal bonds are conducted according to   certain rules, including the “priority of orders,” which establishes the sequence in which bonds   will be allocated to specific types of orders.  Issuer priority rules typically assign retail customer   orders the highest priority in the bond allocation process.  Issuers generally prioritize customer   orders ahead of orders for broker-dealers seeking bonds for their own inventory, and as a result   such orders are often not filled.  Potential purchasers consider order priorities significant because   orders for bonds in primary offerings often exceed the amount of bonds available.     RBC’s Practices Concerning Flippers   6.  During the relevant period, the Head of RBC’s municipal sales, trading and   syndication group (“RBC’s Municipal Manager”) appointed a single RBC salesperson to cover   accounts held by RMR, CPM and their affiliates (collectively, “the flippers”) at RBC.  The   flippers were assigned to a single institutional salesperson because the Municipal Manager   understood that the flippers’ primary business was buying and selling new issue bonds based on   indications of interest that they received from broker-dealers.    2    SEC v. RMR Asset Management Company, et al.  , 18-CV-01895-AJB-JMA (S.D. Cal. filed Aug. 14, 2018)   (partially settled action against RMR and 13 associated individuals for acting as unregistered brokers and, as to 10 of   them, for engaging in fraudulent practices in connection with flipping new issue municipal bonds).  In August 2020,   the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California granted summary judgment to the SEC, finding that   three RMR associates acted as unregistered brokers in violation of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act when they   engaged in thousands of securities transactions for RMR.    3    SEC v. Core Performance Management, LLC, et al.  , 18-CV-81081-BB (S.D. Fla., filed Aug. 14, 2018) (settled   action against CPM and five associated individuals for acting as unregistered brokers and for engaging in fraudulent   practices in connection with flipping new issue municipal bonds).   7.  RBC’s Municipal Manager directed that all trading in new issue bonds with the   flippers be done through the salesperson appointed to cover them.  Accordingly, that salesperson   submitted orders for new issue bonds for the flippers to RBC’s syndicate desk only if directed to   do so by the Municipal Manager and/or an underwriter on the syndicate desk.  The salesperson   likewise placed indications of interest for new issue bonds with the flippers for RBC’s inventory   only if instructed to do so by trading personnel on RBC’s trading desk.    8.  During the relevant period, RBC had a written internal policy (the “Policy”)   relating to new issue municipal bond offerings.  The Policy established procedures that RBC’s   syndicate desk was to follow when RBC was acting as sole underwriter or senior syndicate   manager.  In the absence of different priority instructions from issuers, flippers were to receive   the lowest priority.  Specifically, the Policy required RBC’s syndicate desk to adhere to a   “standard methodology,” and prioritize orders and allocate bonds as follows:    ●    1  st    priority: Orders for Customers   ●    2  nd    priority: Orders for [RBC’s] own account, [RBC] related accounts or [RBC]   affiliated accounts (or syndicate member’s own, related or affiliated accounts, if   applicable)   ●    3  rd    priority: Orders for Broker-Dealers other than [RBC] and syndicate members   ●    4  th    priority: Any other orders   9.  The Policy defined “Customer” orders entitled to first priority under the standard   methodology to “generally include all orders received by or on behalf of an individual or   institution other than 2  nd  , 3  rd    and 4  th    priority.”  Orders that had last, or fourth, priority were   defined as “[any] other orders, including orders such as those submitted by a customer who, in   the reasonable belief of [RBC] plans to purchase the securities and immediately resell such   securities at higher prices (known as a “flipper”) or instances in which [RBC] is unable to   reasonably authenticate the status or qualification of an order during a retail order period directed   by an Issuer.”     10.  Pursuant to the Policy, in advance of each negotiated offering where RBC’s   syndicate desk acted as sole underwriter or senior syndicate manager, RBC provided issuers a   written notice titled “Notice of Priority of Orders from and Allocations to Investors” (the   “Notices”).  The Notices described the standard methodology, and they stated that RBC would   “deviate from such priority only when deemed by [RBC] to be in the best interests of the   syndicate or unless the Issuer otherwise consents.”     11.  The Policy further required RBC’s syndicate desk to document any and all   deviations from established priority provisions, as well as the reasons for the deviations, and to   keep that documentation and any issuer instructions in the firm’s underwriting files.    RBC Improperly Allocated Bonds to the Flippers   12.  During the relevant period, when RBC was acting as sole underwriter or senior   syndicate manager, RBC’s syndicate desk did not always adhere to the standard methodology set   forth in the Policy and the Notices in the absence of different priority instructions from issuers.    On forty-one occasions when orders exceeded the new issue bonds available, the syndicate desk   prioritized orders for flippers over orders for “Customers” (as defined by the standard   methodology) and dealer orders.  Further, the syndicate desk failed to document these deviations   from the standard methodology or the reasons for them.  The decisions to allocate new issue   bonds to the flippers in these instances were made by the Head of RBC’s syndicate desk or the   underwriter on the desk assigned to directly manage the offering, in consultation with the   Municipal Manager and/or RBC’s municipal sales manager.         13.  When RBC’s syndicate desk allocated oversubscribed bonds to the flippers in   contravention of the standard methodology, the flippers orders’ “crowded out” institutional   customer and/or dealer orders which should have been filled first according to the standard   methodology.  For example, in September 2016, RBC’s syndicate desk served as senior manager   for a negotiated offering of municipal bonds in the total principal amount of $127.6 million.  In   connection with the offering, RBC’s sales desk submitted eight orders for four different   maturities on behalf of RMR and two of its affiliates to the firm’s syndicate desk.  Orders for all   four of the maturities sought by the flippers exceeded the available bonds, with three of the   maturities oversubscribed between 290% and 622%.  Nonetheless, RBC’s syndicate desk   allocated a combined $3.3 million in the four maturities to RMR and its affiliates while   approximately $130.3 million in institutional customer orders and approximately $127.3 million   in dealer orders went unfilled.   14.  RBC’s syndicate desk allocated oversubscribed new issue bonds to the flippers in   order to maintain relationships with the flippers who often purchased new issue bonds from RBC   in deals where there were not enough other buyers for the bonds.  As described below, RBC also   acquired new issue bonds in offerings in which it was not a participating underwriter through the   flippers.     15.  RBC’s syndicate desk also failed to follow issuer priority instructions in   connection with a November 2015 negotiated offering of municipal bonds in the total principal   amount of $626.8 million for which RBC acted as senior manager.  The issuer directed that a   retail order period be held in which first priority would be given to retail customer orders.    Shortly before the retail order period closed, the salesperson assigned to cover the flippers   submitted two orders for RMR and an order for a CPM affiliate to the syndicate desk.  The   salesperson falsely certified the orders met the issuer’s retail eligibility criteria, and affirmed   their eligibility by providing zip codes that were not associated with the flippers.  Although the   Municipal Manager and the Head of the syndicate desk, who directly managed the offering, were   aware that the flippers were not retail customers and that they did not meet the issuer’s retail   eligibility criteria, they allocated $500,000 in bonds of one maturity to RMR and $1,000,000 and   $250,000 in bonds of another maturity to RMR and the CPM affiliate, respectively.  As a result,   retail orders from other buyers for these maturities were not filled.     16.  RBC made a profit of approximately $69,034 from the forty-four improper   allocations of new issue municipal bonds that the syndicate desk made to the flippers.     RBC Improperly Used the Flippers to Obtain New Issue Bonds for its Inventory   17.  In addition, during the relevant period, RBC improperly acquired new issue   municipal bonds for the firm’s inventory by placing orders with the flippers to circumvent the   lower priority that issuers typically assigned to non-syndicate dealer orders in offerings that it did   not underwrite.  When acquiring bonds for inventory, RBC was required to submit dealer orders   directly to the underwriters offering the bonds.  Instead, when RBC’s municipal trading desk   wanted new issue bonds for inventory, the traders directed the salesperson assigned to cover the   flippers to place indications of interest for the bonds with the flippers.  The salesperson placed   the traders’ indications of interest with the flippers when the salesperson knew or should have   known that the flippers would attempt to fill these indications by placing customer orders with   the underwriters, when these orders were actually dealer orders on behalf of RBC.  When the   flippers obtained the new issue bonds from the underwriters, they immediately sold or “flipped”"

RBC’s Municipal Manager directed that all trading in new issue bonds with the   flippers be done through the salesperson appointed to cover them.  Accordingly, that salesperson   submitted orders for new issue bonds for the flippers to RBC’s syndicate desk only if directed to   do so by the Municipal Manager and/or an underwriter on the syndicate desk.

The Policy defined “Customer” orders entitled to first priority under the standard   methodology to “generally include all orders received by or on behalf of an individual or   institution other than 2  nd  , 3  rd    and 4  th    priority.”  Orders that had last, or fourth, priority were   defined as “[any] other orders, including orders such as those submitted by a customer who, in   the reasonable belief of [RBC] plans to purchase the securities and immediately resell such   securities at higher prices (known as a “flipper”) or instances in which [RBC] is unable to   reasonably authenticate the status or qualification of an order during a retail order period directed   by an Issuer.”     10.

RBC Improperly Allocated Bonds to the Flippers   12.  During the relevant period, when RBC was acting as sole underwriter or senior   syndicate manager, RBC’s syndicate desk did not always adhere to the standard methodology set   forth in the Policy and the Notices in the absence of different priority instructions from issuers.

When RBC’s syndicate desk allocated oversubscribed bonds to the flippers in   contravention of the standard methodology, the flippers orders’ “crowded out” institutional   customer and/or dealer orders which should have been filled first according to the standard   methodology.  For example, in September 2016, RBC’s syndicate desk served as senior manager   for a negotiated offering of municipal bonds in the total principal amount of $127.6 million.

Although the   Municipal Manager and the Head of the syndicate desk, who directly managed the offering, were   aware that the flippers were not retail customers and that they did not meet the issuer’s retail   eligibility criteria, they allocated $500,000 in bonds of one maturity to RMR and $1,000,000 and   $250,000 in bonds of another maturity to RMR and the CPM affiliate, respectively.  As a result,   retail orders from other buyers for these maturities were not filled.     16.  RBC made a profit of approximately $69,034 from the forty-four improper   allocations of new issue municipal bonds that the syndicate desk made to the flippers.     RBC Improperly Used the Flippers to Obtain New Issue Bonds for its Inventory   17.  In addition, during the relevant period, RBC improperly acquired new issue   municipal bonds for the firm’s inventory by placing orders with the flippers to circumvent the   lower priority that issuers typically assigned to non-syndicate dealer orders in offerings that it did   not underwrite.  When acquiring bonds for inventory, RBC was required to submit dealer orders   directly to the underwriters offering the bonds.  Instead, when RBC’s municipal trading desk   wanted new issue bonds for inventory, the traders directed the salesperson assigned to cover the   flippers to place indications of interest for the bonds with the flippers.  The salesperson placed   the traders’ indications of interest with the flippers when the salesperson knew or should have   known that the flippers would attempt to fill these indications by placing customer orders with   the underwriters, when these orders were actually dealer orders on behalf of RBC.  When the   flippers obtained the new issue bonds from the underwriters, they immediately sold or “flipped”"
Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board,Kenneth G. Friedrich,US SEC | What's New,US Securities and Exchange Commission,"Kenneth G. Friedrich  UNITED STATES OF AMERICA   Before the   SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION   SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934   Release No. 93043 / September 17, 2021   ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING   File No. 3-20569   In the Matter of   Kenneth G. Friedrich,   Respondent.   ORDER INSTITUTING   ADMINISTRATIVE AND CEASE-AND-  DESIST PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO   SECTIONS 15(b), 15B(c) AND 21C OF   THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF   1934, MAKING FINDINGS, AND   IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS   AND A CEASE-AND-DESIST ORDER   I.   The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate and in the   public interest that public administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are,   instituted pursuant to Sections 15(b), 15B(c) and 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934   (“Exchange Act”) against Kenneth G. Friedrich (“Friedrich” or “Respondent”).     II.    In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer   of Settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the   purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the   Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings   herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of these   proceedings, which are admitted, and except as provided herein in Section V, Respondent consents   to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to   Sections 15(b), 15B(c) and 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 9(b) of the   Investment Company Act of 1940, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a   Cease-and-Desist Order (“Order”), as set forth below.     III.    On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds  1    that:   Summary   This matter involves improper conduct by Friedrich in connection with RBC Capital   Markets, LLC’s (“RBC”) purchase and sale of certain new issue municipal bonds from and to   unregistered brokers known as “flippers.”  Friedrich served as Head of RBC’s Municipal Sales,   Trading and Syndication group (the “Municipal Group”) from 2010 to June 2016.     RBC’s internal policy for primary offerings required the firm’s syndicate desk, when acting   as sole underwriter or senior syndicate manager, to allocate bonds according to a “standard   methodology” that prioritized customer and dealer orders over orders for flippers absent different   instructions from issuers.  However, between January 2014 and December 2017, the syndicate desk   did not always follow the standard methodology, instead sometimes filling orders for flippers ahead   and instead of institutional customer and dealer orders when orders exceeded the bonds available.    In connection with one November 2015 offering where the issuer directed a retail order period, the   syndicate desk also allocated some bonds to two flippers ahead and instead of retail customers   although the flippers did not meet the issuer’s retail eligibility criteria.  From at least January 2014   to June 2016, Friedrich was aware that the syndicate desk did not always follow the standard   methodology and he permitted the underwriters on the syndicate desk to fill orders for flippers   ahead and instead of customer and dealer orders.  He also participated in the decision to allocate   bonds to flippers in the November 2015 offering.     Between January 2014 and December 2017, RBC also used flippers to circumvent issuer   priority instructions and receive higher priority for its dealer orders in some instances when RBC   was not a participating underwriter in the offering.  From at least January 2014 to June 2016,   Friedrich permitted RBC traders to place orders for new issue bonds with flippers.  He was aware   that the flippers sometimes placed purported “customer” orders with the underwriters and, when   allocated bonds, sold the bonds to RBC.     As a result of this conduct, Friedrich violated Section 15B(c)(1) of the Exchange Act and   Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (“MSRB”) Rules G-11(k) and G-17.  He also violated   MSRB Rule G-27, and failed reasonably to supervise within the meaning of Section 15(b)(4)(E)   of the Exchange Act, with a view to preventing and detecting violations of MSRB Rules G-11(k)   and G-17 by a certain registered representative.   Respondent   1.    Kenneth G. Friedrich  , age 57, resides in New York, New York.  From January   1999 to June 2016, Friedrich was a registered representative associated with RBC.  From 2007 to   1    The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondent’s Offer of Settlement and are not binding on any other   person or entity in this or any other proceeding.     2010, he served as Head of RBC’s sales desk in the Municipal Group and, from 2010 to June 2016,   he served as Head of the Municipal Group.     Relevant Entities   2.    RBC Capital Markets, LLC  , incorporated in Minnesota with a principal place of   business in New York, New York, is registered with the Commission as a broker-dealer,   municipal securities dealer, investment adviser and municipal advisor.        3.    RMR Asset Management Company (“RMR”)  , was a California corporation   with a principal place of business in Chula Vista, California.  RMR primarily bought and sold   new issue bonds.  RMR was not registered with the Commission.  The Commission filed an   enforcement action against RMR and its associates in August 2018.  2  4.    Core Performance Management, LLC (“CPM”)   was a Florida limited liability   company located in Boca Raton, Florida that was dissolved on July 27, 2016.  CPM primarily   bought and sold new issue municipal bonds.  CPM was not registered with the Commission.  The   Commission filed an enforcement action against CPM and its associates in August 2018.  3  Background on Municipal Underwriting Process   5.  Municipalities often raise money by issuing bonds that are sold to the public   through an underwriting process.  In what is known as a “negotiated” offering, the municipal   issuer chooses a broker-dealer to act either as sole underwriter or as the senior manager of an   underwriting syndicate.  An underwriting syndicate is a group of broker-dealers that join together   to purchase new issue bonds from the issuer to distribute the bonds to the public.     6.  Negotiated offerings of new issue municipal bonds are conducted according to   certain rules, including the “priority of orders,” which establishes the sequence in which bonds   will be allocated to specific types of orders.  Issuer priority rules typically assign retail customer   orders the highest priority in the bond allocation process.  Issuers generally prioritize customer   orders ahead of orders for broker-dealers seeking bonds for their own inventory, and as a result   such orders are often not filled.     2    SEC v. RMR Asset Management Company, et al.  , 18-CV-01895-AJB-JMA (S.D. Cal. filed Aug. 14, 2018)   (partially settled action against RMR and 13 associated individuals for acting as unregistered brokers and, as to 10 of   them, for engaging in fraudulent practices in connection with flipping new issue municipal bonds).  In August 2020,   the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California granted summary judgment to the SEC, finding that   the three non-settling RMR associates acted as unregistered brokers in violation of Section 15(a) of the Exchange   Act when they engaged in thousands of securities transactions for RMR.    3    SEC v. Core Performance Management, LLC, et al.  , 18-CV-81081-BB (S.D. Fla., filed Aug. 14, 2018) (settled   action against CPM and five associated individuals for acting as unregistered brokers and for engaging in fraudulent   practices in connection with flipping new issue municipal bonds).   RBC’s Standard Methodology for Allocating Bonds in Primary Offerings   7.  Between January 2014 and December 2017, RBC had a written internal policy   (the “Policy”) relating to new issue municipal bond offerings.  The Policy established procedures   that RBC’s syndicate desk was to follow when RBC was acting as sole underwriter or senior   syndicate manager.  In the absence of different priority instructions from issuers, flippers were to   receive the lowest priority.  Specifically, the Policy required RBC’s syndicate desk to adhere to a   “standard methodology,” and prioritize orders and allocate bonds as follows:   ●    1  st    priority: Orders for Customers   ●    2  nd    priority: Orders for [RBC’s] own account, [RBC] related accounts or [RBC]   affiliated accounts (or syndicate member’s own, related or affiliated accounts, if   applicable)   ●    3  rd    priority: Orders for Broker-Dealers other than [RBC] and syndicate members   ●    4  th    priority: Any other orders   8.  The Policy defined “Customer” orders entitled to first priority under the standard   methodology to “generally include all orders received by or on behalf of an individual or   institution other than 2  nd  , 3  rd    and 4  th    priority.”  Orders that had last, or fourth, priority were   defined as “[any] other orders, including orders such as those submitted by a customer who, in   the reasonable belief of [RBC] plans to purchase the securities and immediately resell such   securities at higher prices (known as a “flipper”) or instances in which [RBC] is unable to   reasonably authenticate the status or qualification of an order during a retail order period directed   by an Issuer.”   9.  Pursuant to the Policy, in advance of each negotiated offering where RBC’s   syndicate desk acted as sole underwriter or senior syndicate manager, RBC provided issuers a   written notice titled “Notice of Priority of Orders from and Allocations to Investors” (the   “Notices”).  The Notices described the standard methodology, and they stated that RBC would   “deviate from such priority only when deemed by [RBC] to be in the best interests of the   syndicate or unless the Issuer otherwise consents.”   10.  The Policy further required RBC’s syndicate desk to document any and all   deviations from established priority provisions, as well as the reasons for the deviations, and to   keep that documentation and any issuer instructions in the firm’s underwriting files.   Friedrich Permitted the Improper Allocation of New Issue Bonds to Flippers   11.  In 2008, Friedrich, as Head of Sales, appointed a single institutional salesperson   to cover certain of RBC’s accounts for RMR, CPM and their affiliates (collectively, “the   flippers”).  As a result of this structure, all of RBC’s municipal bond transactions with flippers   were coordinated through the salesperson responsible for covering the flippers’ accounts.       12.  When serving as sole underwriter or senior syndicate manager, RBC’s syndicate   desk did not always adhere to the standard methodology in the Policy and the Notices, in the   absence of different priority instructions from issuers.  Instead, on at least 41 occasions when   orders exceeded the new issue bonds available, the syndicate desk prioritized orders for flippers   over orders for institutional customer and dealer orders.  As a result, the flippers orders’   “crowded out” institutional customer and/or dealer orders which should have been filled first.    Further, RBC’s syndicate desk failed to document these deviations from the standard   methodology or the reasons for them.  Friedrich knew that the syndicate desk did not always   follow the standard methodology in the absence of different instructions from issuers, and he   permitted the Head of the RBC syndicate desk (the “Syndicate Manager”) and the other   underwriters on the syndicate desk to sometimes allocate bonds to the flippers ahead and instead of   customers and dealers.    13.  For example, in March 2016, RBC served as senior manager for a negotiated   offering of municipal bonds in the total principal amount of $62.2 million.  In connection with   the offering, the salesperson who Friedrich assigned to cover the flipper accounts submitted four   orders for three different bond maturities on behalf of RMR and two CPM affiliates.  Orders for   the three bond maturities exceeded the available bonds by between 19% and 77%.  Despite this,   RBC’s syndicate desk allocated a combined $1.1 million in the three bond maturities to RMR   and the CPM affiliates.  As a result, approximately $7.9 million in institutional customer orders   and approximately $7.8 million in dealer orders were not filled.   14.  In one offering during the relevant period, the syndicate desk also allocated   oversubscribed bonds to the flippers ahead and instead of retail customers in contravention of the   issuer’s priority instructions.  In November 2015, RBC acted as senior syndicate manager for a   negotiated offering of municipal bonds in the total principal amount of $626.8 million.  The   issuer directed that a retail order period be held in which first priority was to be given to retail   customer orders.  Shortly before the retail order period closed, the salesperson who Friedrich   assigned to cover the flippers submitted two orders for RMR and an order for a CPM affiliate to   the syndicate desk.  The salesperson falsely certified that the orders met the issuer’s retail   eligibility criteria and affirmed their eligibility by providing zip codes that were not associated   with the flippers’ locations.  Friedrich and the Syndicate Manager participated in the decision to   allocate bonds to the flippers in this offering.  Although Friedrich and the Syndicate Manager,   who directly managed the offering, were aware that the flippers were not retail customers and   that the flippers did not meet the issuer’s retail eligibility criteria, the syndicate desk allocated   $500,000 in bonds of one maturity to RMR and $1,000,000 and $250,000 in bonds of another   maturity to RMR and the CPM affiliate, respectively.  As a result, retail orders from other buyers   for these maturities were not filled.     15.  Friedrich permitted the syndicate desk to deviate from the standard methodology   because he understood that RBC benefitted from its relationships with the flippers, who often   purchased new issue bonds from RBC in deals where there were not enough other buyers for the   bonds.     Friedrich Permitted the Improper Purchase of New Issue Bonds from Flippers   16.  When acquiring new issue municipal bonds for inventory, broker-dealers are   required to submit dealer orders directly to the underwriters offering the bonds.  From at least   January 2014 to June 2016, Friedrich permitted RBC traders to use flippers to circumvent this   requirement and obtain higher priority for RBC’s orders in offerings in which the firm was not a   participating underwriter.  When RBC’s trading desk wanted new issue bonds for inventory, the   traders directed the salesperson Friedrich assigned to cover the flippers to place indications of   interest in purchasing the bonds with the flippers.  Friedrich was aware that the flippers   sometimes attempted to fill the indications they received from RBC by placing customer orders,   which had higher priority than dealer orders, with the underwriters.  He also was aware that,   when the flippers obtained bonds from the underwriters, they immediately sold or “flipped” the   bonds to RBC.  Between January 2014 and December 2017, RBC improperly obtained bonds for   inventory from flippers on at least 87 occasions.               Friedrich Failed Reasonably to Supervise the Syndicate Manager   17.  Between January 2014 and June 2016, Friedrich was the first-level supervisor of   RBC’s Syndicate Manager.  Frie"

Chapitre 2   La  finalité du chapitre  2  est d’abord celle de mettre en application  l’article 282,   paragraphe 2, LSA, en définissant le minimum absolu des renseignements nécessaires à   l’appréciation d’une demande d’agrément ou d’immatriculation pour chacune des   catégories de distributeurs  par le CAA. Ces listes non limitatives de documents et   d’informations composant  le dossier d’agrément ou d’immatriculation constituent une   nouveauté et sont inspirées des listes détaillées aux articles 1  er    ss. du Règlement du CAA   15/03 relatif aux entreprises d’assurance et de réassurance, tel que modifié.    2   L’article 2 du Règlement CAA indique que l’immatriculation au registre des distributeurs,   visée à l’article 286 de la Loi, s’opère par le biais de formulaires d’immatriculation   pouvant être complétés directement en ligne. Cet article transpose ainsi  fidèlement   l’article 3, paragraphe 2, alinéa 2, de la directive IDD.   Il convient de noter que les paragraphes 1  er     et 2 de l’article 6 du Règlement CAA   reprennent le contenu de l’actuel article 2 du Règlement grand-ducal sur l’assurance de   la responsabilité civile professionnelle en mettant à jour la référence vers la LSA et en   adaptant les montants minima de la couverture aux montants résultant d’un projet de   norme technique réglementaire (« Regulatory Technical Standard »)  de l’EIOPA basée   sur  l’article 10, paragraphe 7, de la directive IDD  et adressée  à la Commission   européenne le 27 juin 2018. Pour des besoins de simplification, il a été jugé opportun   d’arrondir au 10.000 euros supérieurs. La réelle innovation de l’article 6 du Règlement   CAA se trouve pourtant dans son paragraphe 3, qui prévoit l’introduction d’un formulaire   téléchargeable et qui doit être signé par l’assureur accordant la couverture. Le formulaire   prévoit  tous  les points nécessaires au  CAA pour pouvoir apprécier  la conformité de   l’assurance contractée par le courtier par rapport aux dispositions légales et   réglementaires en la matière. Afin de simplifier la supervision, ce certificat couvre toute   une année civile, du 1  er    janvier au 31 décembre. Un tel pas a été jugé nécessaire vu la   panoplie de certificats d’assurance qui sont souvent imprécis, voire incomplets que le   CAA reçoit annuellement, et qui nécessitent  l’envoi de nombreux courriers entre le   régulateur et les courtiers concernés.   L’article 7 du présent Règlement CAA est basé sur l’article 3 du Règlement grand-ducal   mais a dû être modifié suite à la mise en place des instruments d’immatriculation en   ligne.    Il convient de préciser que l’article 6 du Règlement grand-ducal actuel concernant la   gestion par intérim du portefeuille d’un courtier d’assurances décédé n’a pas été repris   dans le présent Règlement du CAA vu que dans ce cas, application pourra être faite de   l’article 288, paragraphe 1  er  , alinéa 5, LSA qui prévoit l’accord d’un agrément temporaire   pour une période n’excédant pas 12 mois dans le cas où le candidat à l’agrément ne   remplit pas les conditions de connaissances professionnelles requises.   Chapitre 3   Le  sous-chapitre  1  er     du  chapitre 3 reprend le contenu des Règlements  CAA 15/01 et   15/02 de manière quasi identique  à une nouveauté près, à savoir une division de   l’examen en trois modules : un module relatif aux matières communes, un module relatif   à l’assurance non vie et un module relatif à l’assurance vie. Les candidats à l’agrément   de dirigeant de société de courtage, de courtier, sous-courtier ou d’agent d’assurances   peuvent dès lors choisir de passer un examen complet comprenant les 3 modules ou un   examen  partiel comprenant à côté du module relatif aux matières communes, soit le   module « vie » soit le module « non vie ».  Ces  nouvelles  modalités  ont  comme   conséquence que les connaissances du candidat sont évaluées séparément pour chaque   module et que la compensation des points ne sera dorénavant  plus possible.  La   composition et le fonctionnement du jury d’examen restent, quant à eux, inchangés.   Le  sous-chapitre 2  contient les dispositions de mise en application de l’article 288,   paragraphe 3, de la Loi  et  traite de la formation et du développement professionnels   continus des intermédiaires d’assurances et de réassurances, tels que définis par la Loi,   et du personnel des entreprises d’assurance et de réassurance pratiquant la vente   directe et ne disposant pas d’un agrément d’agent d’assurance (la « formation   continue »). Dans ce contexte, il importe de rappeler que l’article 285-1, paragraphe 1  er  ,   de la Loi prévoit une période transitoire prenant fin au 1  er     janvier 2020 au profit des   entreprises d’assurance de faire agréer leur personnel pratiquant déjà la vente directe   lors de l’entrée en vigueur de la Loi. Cette période transitoire était jugée nécessaire afin   3   de permettre aux entreprises d’assurance d’organiser des formations pour toutes ces   personnes en vue de les préparer à l’examen pour agents d’assurances.    La formation continue est divisée en 3 piliers, à savoir la législation, la connaissance des   produits  d’assurance ou de réassurance et les soft-skills  comme les techniques   commerciales. Cette formation continue  doit en tout état de cause s’orienter, tout en   respectant le  principe de proportionnalité, aux exigences minimales imposées par   l’annexe I de la directive IDD dont le contenu est reproduit en  tant qu’annexe 3 du   présent règlement. La formation devra donc couvrir une variété de domaines tels que   dans celui de la législation applicable à la distribution d’assurance et de réassurance, de   la législation fiscale ou sociale, du traitement des réclamations ou de la gestion des   conflits d’intérêts ou encore des connaissances en matière financière ou une   connaissance des règles déontologiques.   Le Règlement CAA reprend le minimum de 15 heures de formation continue par an de la    directive IDD.  Il est toutefois loisible aux entités responsables qui sont définies par le   Règlement CAA, de prévoir un minimum d’heures plus élevé. Une liste des intermédiaires   n’ayant pas respecté ces heures de formation minima prévues  par le Règlement CAA   devra être communiquée avant le 31 janvier de chaque année au CAA  qui  pourra   imposer soit une sanction en vertu de l’article 303 de la Loi, soit des formations de   rattrapage d’une durée au moins équivalente à 150% des heures de formation   manquantes.    Le contenu de cette formation continue est, quant à lui, évalué globalement par période   de référence de trois ans, donc sur un minimum de 45 heures. Pendant une telle période   de référence,  au moins 15 heures de formation doivent porter sur la législation en   matière d’assurance et de réassurance. Les  techniques commerciales et le   développement personnel ne doivent comporter  au contraire  qu’un maximum de 15   heures pendant cette même période. Ce rythme triennal n’est pas interrompu par des   périodes  pendant lesquelles la personne concernée ne disposerait pas d’un  agrément.   Chaque période de référence est bien cantonnée, c.à.d. que les heures de formations   passées en plus des exigences posées par le Règlement CAA ne peuvent pas être   transférées  sur la prochaine période de référence. Pour les cas de période de non-  agrément d’au moins 12 mois, le minimum d’heures de formation de la période triennale   est  réduit proportionnellement, mais lors d’une reprise ultérieure d’une activité   d’intermédiation la personne concernée doit passer des formations de remise à niveau de   3 heures par période de 12 mois de non agrément et par groupe de branche. Ces heures   de formation de rattrapage ne sont évidemment pas cumulables avec les 15 heures de   formation continue « ordinaire »  que l’intermédiaire devra suivre annuellement.  Des   aménagements similaires sont également prévus en cas de congé de maladie prolongé   et de congé de maternité ou de congé parental à plein temps.   Pour des raisons pratiques, le début d’une période de référence se situe au 1  er    janvier de   l’année qui suit le 1  er     agrément  ou le début de l’activité de vente directe.  Pour les   personnes  disposant déjà d’un agrément au 1  er     octobre 2018  ou occupant déjà une   activité de vente directe au sein d’une entreprise d’assurance ou de réassurance à cette   même date, la période de référence commence à courir au 1  er    janvier 2019.    Les entreprises d’assurance ou de réassurance pratiquant la vente directe, les   entreprises d’assurance ayant recours à des agents d’assurances, les sociétés de   courtage et les intermédiaires d’assurance à titre accessoire personnes morales doivent   désigner un responsable de la formation dont les missions minimales sont énumérées à   l’article 42  du Règlement CAA.  Ces missions comprennent notamment pour chaque   personne soumise à l’obligation de formation continue, la tenue d’un carnet de formation   dont le contenu est fixé par le Règlement CAA, l’organisation des formations,  la   détermination du caractère éligible ou non d’une formation et du nombre d’heures qui   peuvent être comptabilisées pour une formation déterminée.    A cet égard, il est important de mentionner que Règlement CAA prévoit que le nombre   d’heures de formation qui peut être comptabilisé par journée est limité à 5.    4   Sauf choix contraire des entités responsables de la formation, sont admissibles les   formations internes, externes et à distance. Il convient de souligner qu’il appartient aux   personnes ayant suivi une formation en dehors de celles organisées par les entités   responsables, de décider d’indiquer ou non cette formation à leur  responsable de la   formation au vu d’une éventuelle validation. Il appartiendra pourtant à ce responsable de   la formation de déterminer la durée mise en compte pour cette formation.    Chapitre 4   Le chapitre 4 prévoit les dispositions d’exécution de l’article 285-3 de la Loi en fixant les   moyens et la fréquence de la vérification de l’honorabilité, au sens de l’article 32,   paragraphe 1  er  , point 15 de la Loi, des agents, des sous-courtiers et du personnel des   entreprises d’assurance et de réassurance actif dans la vente directe.    Chapitre 5   Le CAA n’est pas compétent pour agréer le personnel de succursales étrangères de   sociétés de courtage ou d’agences d’assurances luxembourgeoises vu que la résidence   professionnelle de ces personnes se situe en dehors du territoire luxembourgeois.

HIPAA - Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act,"'People are fed up:' Staff shortages, waiting list grows at Colorado mental hospital",The Gazette | News,The Gazette (Colorado Springs),"'People are fed up:' Staff shortages, waiting list grows at Colorado mental hospital  Chase Falk waited nearly six months in the Larimer County jail for a bed to open for a court-ordered mental competency evaluation at the state-run Colorado Mental Health Institute in Pueblo.  Chase Falk waited nearly six months in the Larimer County jail for a bed to open for a court-ordered mental competency evaluation at the state-run Colorado Mental Health Institute in Pueblo.  From January until the end of June, the 20-year-old Kersey resident was kept in isolation a total of 53 days for misbehavior, including flooding his cell and refusing to go to court, said his father, Carl Falk, who obtained his son’s jail records.  When he wasn’t in seclusion, Chase Falk was on “red tag status” for grabbing an officer’s Taser gun when he was being booked on DUI and drug charges and sat in his cell for 23 hours a day.  That’s when Carl Falk thinks his son’s delicate sanity slipped over the edge into a dark psychosis.  “He was basically losing his mind in jail the whole time,” Falk said.  At least 300 people with criminal cases are waiting in jails across Colorado for a spot at the state’s primary forensic psychiatric hospital, said Dr. Robert Werthwein, director of the Office of Behavioral Health at the Colorado Department of Human Services, which oversees the mental hospitals in Pueblo and at Fort Logan.  That’s the longest waiting list for pre-trial criminal defendants Werthwein has seen.  The record high comes as Colorado remains under a two-year-old federal court consent decree that found the state violated due process by not providing mental health competency evaluations on a timely basis.  Not complying has cost the state $17 million in federal fines since March 2019, according to Colorado Department of Human Services spokeswoman Madlynn Ruble. The maximum annual fine of $10 million is meant keep the state on task after the agency violated two previous settlements.  Werthwein said the waiting list to get into the Pueblo facility — which only accepts court-ordered patients — had reached 250, but was whittled down to about 80 names pre-pandemic.  “We had a real good trajectory and were making significant gains before COVID,” he said. “We’d hoped to eliminate it.”  Instead, with a workforce shortage amounting to 312 open positions at the Pueblo hospital, he said the state has been forced to temporarily close three of the facility’s 24 units “for patient and staff safety.”  Patients have been distributed to other units, he said.  The in-patient hospital has a 516-bed capacity but was running a census of 416 patients about 10 days ago, when Werthwein spoke to The Gazette.  “We, like all other health facilities, are struggling to get the staff,” he said.  Job vacancies include everything from janitorial workers to managerial positions to hands-on nursing, he said.  Nearly one-third of the openings, or 194 positions, are client care aides, according to information the state supplied upon request.  There are 60 nursing positions available, 22 mental health clinicians and 20 psychologists, social workers and counselors, among others.  Low staffing also was an issue in 2017, when there were 97 patient care positions open and the state facility was deemed in danger of losing federal Medicare and Medicaid funding.  In July 2019, the hospital had just two violations during a Colorado Public Health and Environment inspection, compared with 15 in June 2017, according to the website, hospitalinspections.org.  The Pueblo hospital has been operating at emergency staffing levels since April, an open-records request showed.  Emergency staffing is the lowest of three levels of function and means the minimum number of staff needed to ensure the safety of staff and patients are on the clock.  “I’m concerned about our staffing,” Werthwein admitted.  A problem for years  The waiting list dilemma spans more than a decade.  The Colorado Department of Human Services agreed in March 2019 to overhaul its evaluation and treatment of mentally ill people suspected of committing crimes after Disability Law Colorado filed a lawsuit in federal court in 2011. The legal advocacy group reopened the lawsuit in 2018.  Plaintiffs argued that the due-process rights of pre-trial criminal defendants were being violated by system delays that kept them behind bars for months while in line for court-mandated mental evaluations, treatment or restoration services. They branded the situation a “human crisis.”  Under the agreement, the state was to move such people into mental care in a more timely fashion and meet other terms. But the process has dragged on and led to fines for continual violations of its conditions.  Werthwein said his office is working with court-appointed special masters on solutions to help bring the state into compliance.  In the 2019 legislative session, Colorado lawmakers passed several bills in an attempt to alleviate the backlog. Creating community-based alternatives for mental health treatment that don’t rely on sending people to the state institutions and increasing state hospital bed capacity from 449 to 516 were among the intended improvements.  Inmates wait ""several months"" in the El Paso County jail in Colorado Springs to be admitted to the Pueblo facility, said classification supervisor Liz Oneal.  ""They can't continue through their court cases if they're not receiving the evaluation or restoration that is court-ordered,"" she said. ""They're months behind because they have no bed space, and they're losing staff. It's always a concern for us.""  Colorado Springs criminal defense attorney Jeremy Loew said the circumstances have become “a constant” in Colorado.  “The state made promises repeatedly to get the problem solved, and if this is continuing to happen and they’re continuing to not have the resources to help our mentally ill people who’re accused of crimes, they need to figure something else out — whether that’s to have more financial resources or hire more people,” he said.  Potentially, people who have been declared mentally incompetent to stand trial could receive competency restoration treatment to be able to continue their case at private facilities outside the state hospital, Loew said.  “If they’re no longer in custody, they can go to a private facility, but a lot of judges are hesitant to do that because if they release someone, they may abscond and not get treatment,” he said.  “The best-case scenario is for people to go to the state hospital and get the treatment they need.”  There are indications that a district court judge’s decision earlier this month that a mental competency evaluation of Boulder mass shooting suspect Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa be conducted at the Boulder County jail — and not the state mental hospital because of the facility's ongoing difficulties.  Boulder District Chief Judge Ingrid Bakke said during the Sept. 7 hearing that she hoped doing the evaluation locally would be faster than sending Alissa, accused of killing 10 people in a Boulder King Soopers on March 22, to the state facility. Boulder County District Attorney Michael Dougherty had requested the evaluation be held at the jail specifically because of the lengthy waiting periods at the Pueblo hospital, court documents show.  “It’s probably not the best-case scenario, especially when we’re dealing with such a high-profile case,” Loew said. “The best people to do these competency evaluations are the people at the state hospital.”  Long hours mount  The number of state employees working at the Pueblo hospital has dropped from 1,388 in 2020 to 1,147 as of five days ago, according to provided state documents. Another 141 contract staff hired through outside agencies also are on the books.  Staff members are leaving for several reasons, said two employees.  Worker shortages have led to some employees being on the job for 12 to 16 hours a day, said Regina Martinez, who works at the Pueblo facility.  “People are fed up,” she said.  The amount of overtime employees put in rose to its highest level this year in July, at 11,344 overtime hours for the month, according to requested department statistics.  The highest for 2020 happened in April, shortly after the pandemic started, with state hospital employees logging 12,175 overtime hours, records show.  Werthwein said hospital leaders ask for volunteers first.  “We’re doing all that we can,” he said. “We’re adding more contract employees, but the shortage of skilled nurses everywhere means we’re all competing, and for us, unfortunately, that means there are people waiting in the jails to get in.”  Closing the three units in Pueblo due to a lack of staff has thrown patients off their normal schedules and routines, said an employee who asked not to be identified for fear of retribution.  Having revolving caregivers has affected patients’ behavior, he said, leading to what he said seems like more violent reactions against staff.  Martinez also said patient-to-staff assaults seem to be occurring more frequently.  The Colorado Department of Human Services denied open-records requests for comparative numbers on assaults.  Such statistics are “used for quality assurance and performance purposes” and protected under state statute referring to confidentiality of licensed health care facilities, the department's reply said.  The hospital’s internal police department Chief Rick McMorran rejected requests for criminal justice records pertaining to recent attacks on staff, citing the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, known as HIPPA.  Regarding police response to incidents at the hospital over the past five years, McMorran said the facility does not have a specific document that contains the number, and therefore processing would involve manually reviewing 12,000 to 13,000 dispatch logs.  He also said there is “no record responsive to the request” for the top reasons police respond to calls for assistance at the hospital.  Werthwein, meanwhile, said he has no indication that assaults have risen this year.  Martinez said recent patient attacks on staff members have caused a broken arm, a broken leg, a hip injury, a smashed nose and other injuries.  “Nurses are having their hair pulled out of their head, they’re being hit in the face, getting teeth knocked loose, and limbs broken,” she said.  Problematic approach  Employees point to a directive from Werthwein for staff to use a softer, less punitive approach in addressing patient behavior as contributing to the internal strife.  The policies and procedures that were enacted in March are not new, Werthwein said.  “We’re reinforcing the culture that’s supposed to be in place because of the policies,” he said. “We didn’t change safety protocols or training; we enforced the policies.”  But how safety is handled is different.  The number of police officers working for the hospital’s internal police department has been reduced by 39% — not from layoffs but through vacancies and attrition, according to Human Services spokeswoman Ruble.  The department had employed 23 full-time police officers and one chief. The department now has 14 full-time officers and one chief, she said. Six full-time police positions are currently open, which Ruble said the department intends to fill.  Their primary duties are to transport patients, supervise patients off campus and investigate suspected crimes on campus.  Also, 45 state corrections officers were removed from authoritative police-type uniforms, retitled clinical safety specialists and given a new role.  Instead of providing law enforcement from a policing or correctional manner, they are non-uniformed and part of the clinical team, Ruble said. They work to build relationships with patients, de-escalate conflict in a non-threatening way and assist with support services to bolster the care of patients, she said.  The direction promotes ""a clinical environment in which all members of the staff on a unit contribute to the clinical well-being of the patients while ensuring a safe milieu,” she said.  Studies show a correctional approach does not work as well as a therapeutic one, Werthwein said, adding that the hospital is not licensed to function as a detention center.  Instead of putting their hands on patients during altercations, staff are to use de-escalation techniques, he said, although employees still are trained on how to use mechanical restraints.  “We know de-escalation treats people humanely and not punitively, and has more positive outcomes than negative ones,” Werthwein said.  However, he said, “I know some staff don’t feel that way.”  Some 300 employees signed a safety petition in January, objecting and calling for more authoritative uniforms to that are security-oriented, among other proposals.  Said the employee who asked not to be identified: “My concern is that the people who make up these rules of how we’re going to deal with problems never work on the units themselves. They don’t know first-hand if these things are going to work or not, and if they don’t work, it puts the frontline staff in a bad position.”  If a patient kicks a staff member, for example, Martinez said, the patient is sent to his room, with no disciplinary action.  ""It used to be we could put them behind a locked door, and they could cool off and work on getting back to privilege levels to get snacks,” she said.  A combination of low staffing and COVID impacts have also diminished the ability of patients to do activities including going to the gym or to the barbershop, Martinez said. And face-to-face visits are still not permitted.  “When you don’t have proper staff, they’re stuck on their unit 24/7 with no break,” she said. “They haven’t had outside barbecues in two years … field trips are not allowed now. It’s just like a day care.”  Werthwein said patients participate in “modified activities” that are “more regimented” under COVID. For example, there are more group therapy sessions within units, he said.  On top of operational differences, some people are quitting over COVID vaccine mandates, Martinez said.  Six workers have left in recent weeks because of the vaccine requirements for state employees, according to requested statistics.  While vaccination rates of staff and in-house patients are high — 80.5% for staff and 91.2% of patients are fully vaccinated, according to state officials — vaccination among incoming patients is “pretty low,” Werthwein said.  Of the roughly 300 criminal defendants on the waiting list to enter the hospital, only 40 have been vaccinated, he said.  A COVID outbreak involving 32 staff and two patients at the Pueblo hospital was reported on Aug. 25, according to public health data.  The Pueblo facility also logged 120 coronavirus cases in February, 213 cases in November 2020, with one staff death, and 29 cases in August 2020.  Chase Falk’s suicide attempt  Suicide attempts inside the psychiatric hospital are not common but do happen, Werthwein said.  “We serve 500 people at a time and close to 1,000 a year with serious mental illness,” he said. “I’m extremely proud of the team we have and the infrequency — it is much lower than any setting in the community.”  However, the state denied a request for the number of suicide attempts at the facility.  Employees such as Martinez believe Chase Falk’s experience is just one example of the effects of ongoing compromised staffing.  Falk, who had been addicted to marijuana and methamphetamine for years, was court-ordered to undergo a mental-competency evaluation at the Pueblo hospital, after police issued five criminal charges on him in a 24-hour period in December 2020.  Falk’s first suicide attempt came inside the "
Fair Housing Act,These readers have clear memories of L.A.'s racist housing practices,The Los Angeles Times | Opinion,The Los Angeles Times,"These readers have clear memories of L.A.'s racist housing practices  An aerial photo, taken in 1953, shows a housing tract in Panorama City, a neighborhood in the San Fernando Valley.  To the editor: Thanks to Gene Slater for his op-ed article on the history of housing segregation in Los Angeles. It brought back memories of my shock and revulsion when my husband and I bought our first house in Westchester in 1955 and we unwittingly became part of the “Kentwood Home Guardians.”  This was an organization established by the Superior Oil Company in 1943, whose Declaration of Protective Restrictions included the provision that only members of the white race could live in the Kentwood area of Westchester. Anyone living in that part of Westchester was automatically a member.  This was enforced until passage of the Fair Housing Act in 1968, and even after then it was the unwritten policy of realtors to steer Black home-seekers away from Westchester. Furthermore, it was well known that any realtor who sold to a Black buyer would never again sell another property in that area.  Thank goodness those days are over, but they should not be forgotten.  Jean Koch, Los Angeles  ..  To the editor: The aerial photo of the San Fernando Valley in 1953 caught my attention. That was the year our family moved from Cleveland to Sun Valley, buying a new tract home for $11,000.  My elementary school in Cleveland in the late 1940s and early ’50s was integrated. My new elementary school in the San Fernando Valley was not; it was mostly white, with some Asian students.   One day in 1954, a neighbor knocked on our door with a petition he wanted Dad to sign. Apparently, an Asian family was planning on moving in down the street, and this had to be stopped. With language I cannot use here, Dad told the man he could go to hell, and besides, we would rather have the Asian family as neighbors than that bigot.  It was an awakening moment for me. I was very proud of my dad that day.  Jerry Lasnik, Thousand Oaks  ..  To the editor: I lived in the Windsor Hills/View Park area of Los Angeles in the 1950s and ’60s with my parents. I remember “block busting,” which was not mentioned in the op-ed article.  Block busting was an effort to get white people to list their homes for sale because, they were being told, people from South L.A. were coming to the area to buy, and owners should sell while they could get a good price.  When the Fair Housing Act was passed, we became aware of how African Americans could “legally” be shut out of housing. “Redlining” practices by lenders existed until at least the 1990s.  I became a realtor in 1980 in Orange County. Fair Housing rules were emphasized then and have been to this day. It’s correct to teach about past discrimination over and over, because otherwise we will forget or fail to learn about it in the first place.   Jane Olinger, Irvine  ..  To the editor: Los Angeles’ realtors might have led the way on residential segregation, but they were certainly not alone. When we bought our house in Sacramento in 1993, there was a provision in the boilerplate purchase agreement that stipulated that people of color could not buy in the neighborhood.  After finding this, I brought it to the attention of our realtor. “Oh, that’s not in effect anymore,” she said, “because it is superseded by federal law.”   I was aghast and struck out the section with a Sharpie pen. I could not, would not agree to such a contract, regardless of racist intent being rendered moot. The fact that it was still there indicated a lack of concern, which I hope does not hold true today.

New Delhi, Sep 20 (SocialNews.XYZ) Amazon, the world's largest online retailer, has initiated an investigation into the conduct of its legal representatives in India, The Morning Context reported.  This investigation comes on the back of a whistleblower complaint alleging that certain monies paid by Amazon in legal fees have been funnelled into bribes by one or more of its legal representatives.  Two people who work closely with Amazon's in-house legal team confirmed that Rahul Sundaram, senior corporate counsel at Amazon, has been sent on leave. The Morning Context reached out to Sundaram for comment. In a text message, he said, ""Sorry I cannot speak with the press.' We could not independently ascertain whether the internal investigation has been completed or is in progress.  Responding to a detailed set of questions, an Amazon spokesperson said: ""We have zero tolerance for corruption. We take allegations of improper actions seriously, investigate them fully, and take appropriate action. We are not commenting on specific allegations or the status of any investigation at this time.""  The report said most American companies take such whistleblower complaints seriously because it is against the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA. The FCPA is a US law which prohibits firms and individuals from paying bribes to foreign government officials to assist in obtaining or retaining business. Adherence to the FCPA is also part of the corporate governance rules governing all public companies.  Employees may not bribe anyone for any reason, whether in dealings with governments or the private sector. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and similar laws in other countries, prohibit offering or giving anything of value, directly or indirectly, to government officials in order to obtain or retain business. Employees may not make illegal payments to government officials themselves or through a third party. Employees who are conducting business with the government officials of any country must contact the Legal Department for guidance on the law governing payments and gifts to governmental officials.  The report said earlier this year, a whistleblower inside Amazon flagged issues of bribery in the Indian operations, which resulted in the internal investigation.  The whistleblower's complaint points to the role played by Vikas Chopra, an independent advocate in New Delhi who works with Amazon as an outside counsel for hire. The complaint specifically alleges that legal fees paid to Chopra by Amazon have been funnelled into bribing government officials. An email with a list of questions sent to Chopra did not elicit any reply.  Two people with direct knowledge of the matter confirmed that Chopra has represented Amazon on legal matters for around three years. For instance, in 2018, Chopra and Rahul Sundaram--the in- house senior counsel who has been sent on leave--represented Amazon's logistics business, Amazon Transportation Services Pvt. Ltd, in a matter pertaining to the employment of Scheduled Tribes with the company in Gujarat.  The internal investigation being carried out by the company is focusing on the role played by Chopra and Sundaram. The two people cited earlier said that Amazon is one of Chopra's largest clients, with yearly billings of upwards of Rs 20 crore. Amazon's investigation spans the many years of the relationship between the company and Chopra, the report added.  Amazon is conducting a wider investigation to get to the bottom of the issue. The company has also been asking questions of its other legal representatives in the country. Most multinational companies employ a slew of legal firms on retainer agreements. In India, Amazon works with some of the largest firms, including AZB & Parkers.  Two people with direct knowledge of the matter said that Amazon has reached out to AZB with questions.  On the heels of this investigation, earlier this month, AZB laid off Kaustabh Sinha, a junior counsel at the firm who has worked on legal matters relating to Amazon. Both people cited above said that Sinha was privy to information pertaining to the case, but was let go the moment the investigation became a hot potato. The Morning Context could not independently verify the circumstances around Sinha's departure from the firm. An email sent to AZB & Parkers seeking comment did not elicit any reply. We could not contact Sinha for a comment, the report said.  Source: IANS"
Fair Housing Act,Real Estate One city plans reparation to Black homeowners. Will others follow?,The Tennessean | Nation Now Posts,The Tennessean,"Real Estate One city plans reparation to Black homeowners. Will others follow?  When Morris “Dino” Robinson tried to refinance his house in Evanston, Illinois, in January, he was shocked to learn his first appraisal was $100,000 lower than a previous appraisal in 2017.  Robinson then sought a second estimate. It determined that the value of his home in Evanston’s fifth ward – a predominantly African-American part of town – had actually increased by $75,000 in that four-year span.  He signed the paperwork based on that appraisal last month, frustrated but not that surprised by the $175,000 swing in his property's value.  The first appraisal ""risked the equity of my home,” said Robinson, who is Black and is the executive director of the Shorefront Legacy Center, a nonprofit that archives the history of Black residents in Evanston and nearby north Chicagosuburbs. “Therefore, it jeopardized my net worth,"" he added. ""This is an ongoing and frustrating process for people like me that needs to end.”  Stalling ownership: Black homeownership's stall during COVID-19 pandemic is the 'epidemic after the epidemic'  'A racist, sexist society': How top companies are struggling to diversify leadership  Homes owned by Black residents have been undervalued for generations, Evanston officials say. Now, the Chicago suburb will try to make amends for that inequity by giving Black residentshousing assistance, a form of reparations —or financial compensation — paid by a government for the harm slavery and discrimination have caused generations of Black Americans.  Residents could begin applying later this month and disbursements could come as soon as this fall, said Robin Rue Simmons, the former Evanston city council member who sparked the idea.  The initiative pushes Evanston to the forefront of a nationwide discussion about whether reparations are owed to Black Americans, and if so, what form should they take.  Reparations initiatives around the nation  Reparation initiatives are also being discussed in other towns and cities including Amherst, Massachusetts,Iowa City, Iowa, and Asheville, North Carolina, where city council members voted unanimously last year to provide reparations to Asheville's Black residents and descendants of former residents now deceased. A city council-approved reparations commission is expected to report between January 2022 and April 2023 with final recommendations on funding and implementation.  In each of those cities, housing reparations are being specifically considered, whether in the form of assistance for homeowners or access to affordable housing.  ""We may not be the exact model other cities will follow,"" said Simmons about Evanston's plans. ""But, hopefully, we will inspire other cities to take the steps to dig into its history.""  Rayshawn Ray, a sociology professor at the University of Maryland and a fellow at the Brookings Institute who has written extensively about reparations, thinks that ""it could be argued that housing is probably the main avenue where funding for reparations should go.”  Creating generational wealth  Owning a home, Ray said, has long been a way to create generational wealth for families. Many households use the equity in their homes to get lines of credit to purchase other properties, help pay for their kids' college tuition, and even buy stocks, Ray said.  “And many Black families don’t have that and have been left out that process, whether it’s from discrimination to redlining,"" Ray said, referring to decades of discrimination in housing and home refinancing.  ►More than just money? Reparations is not about cutting a check. It's about repairing a community.  Though the federal government banned some racist housing practices during the 1960s and 1970s as part of the Fair Housing Act, which prohibits discrimination of the sale, rental and financing of housing based on a person's race, religion, national origin, sex, Black owners still face practices that devalue their homes and diminish their potential wealth.  That's according to an article co-written by Ray and Andre Perry, a senior fellow with the Brookings Institute and a residence-in-scholar at American University.  Homes in mostly Black neighborhoods are worth 23% less than homes of similar quality in neighborhoods with few or no Black residents, they say..  Assumptions about variousfactors, including housing and neighborhood quality, education and crime, result in homes in Black neighborhoods being undervalued by roughly $48,000 on average, which amounts to “a whopping $156 billion that these homeowners would have received if their homes were priced at market rates,” Perry and Ray say.  Arguments can be made that reparations are also owed to African Americans for biased criminal justice policies, education disparities and an ongoing lack of opportunities to own businesses.  “But, when it comes to municipalities, they know when it comes to housing they have some records clearly on file that show they discriminated against particular residents,” Perry said.  In the national reckoning on racism that followed the killing of George Floyd by a white Minneapolis police officer, municipalities ""are tired of sitting on their hands and not doing anything,'' Perry said. ""There's a whole generation of city leaders who refuse to let racism fester.""  Evanston's choice  In March, the Evanston city council overwhelmingly voted to approve the Local Reparations Restorative Housing Program, which addresses racial discrimination in housing. It will grant qualifying households up to $25,000 that can be used for either down payments or home repairs.  The program is the first initiative of a citywide reparations fund created in 2019. The program also came a year after Evanston formed an Equity and Empowerment Commission and apologized for its history of discrimination.  In addition to being “a step towards revitalizing, preserving, and stabilizing ,” Black-owned homes, a city resolution about the Local Reparations Restorative Housing Program said it will also attempt to increase homeownership,.  More access to housing was one of the key drivers that led Simmons, then a member of Evanston's city council representing the mostly Black-populated Fifth Ward, to take action. She sent an email to the Equity and Empowerment Commission in February 2019. Her subject line was “Black Equality Policy,” but ""it was really about reparations,"" she recalled, fearing that her colleagues weren't ready to talk about it.  However, four months later, the city council passed a resolution that called for ending structural racism and committing to racial equity. The resolution didn't mention how the city would do it and there was no mention of reparations.  Despite pointing out there was a nearly $47,000 difference in median household income and a 13-year difference in life expectancy between Black and White Evanston residents, Simmons knew ""that word, 'reparations',"" would lead to uncomfortable conversations.  Yet Simmons said was ready for it and thought others eventually would be as well.  ""We decided not to wait and do what is right in our purview, and that's to make right the wrongs in the city of Evanston and lead by example with a resolution,"" Simmons said.  In those first two commission meetings open to the public in July 2019, housing dominated the discussion, Simmons said.  Robinson co-wrote a 77-page historical reportcommissioned by the city that chronicles Evanston's discriminatory practices, including in the areas of housing, education and policing.  “They were the means by which legacies were limited and denied,” Robinson wrote.  Currently, $400,000 is being allotted for the housing program out of an initial $10 million reparations fund paid for by the city’s tax on the sale of recreational marijuana.  Black residents are eligible if they lived in Evanston between 1919 and 1969 or are a direct descendant of someone who did, Robinson said. Those who don’t meet that criteria also may apply if they can prove they encountered housing discrimination because of city policies or practices after 1969, the year after the federal government passed the Fair Housing Act.  “The qualifications are quite simple. ""We have a collection of high school yearbooks dating back to 1919. You just have to prove you or a family member lived in Evanston,'' said Robinson, who helped provide the historical documentation of Evanston's housing discrimination for city officials.  Perry believes that despite the renewed interest in U.S. House bill HR 40, proposed federal legislation that could create a commission to study and develop reparations proposals for African-Americans, any reparation laws should likely come at the local and state level.  ""It will be up to the municipal and state levels to create laws that will bubble up to Washington, and the knowledge gained from that will lead to a more comprehensive approach to deal with the systemic racism on many different levels,"" Perry said.  But William Darity Jr., an economist at Duke University, who has spent decades researching what reparations could look like, thinks that what' occurring in cities can't be called reparations.  Instead, Darity, who has estimated that it would cost $10 trillion to $12 trillion to completely erase the Black-White wealth gap for approximately15 million Black households who are descendants of persons enslaved in the United States, said the local actions should be referred to as ""racial equity initiatives.""  ""States and localities should stop the pretense of conducting 'reparations' projects,"" Darity said. It's ""fine if they want to undertake these initiatives, but please call them something else ... They are not reparations.""  Evanston city council member Cicely Fleming wrote in a USA TODAY opinion piece in July that ""It's not the responsibility of states to repay the debt of chattel slavery; that falls to the federal government. But cash payments to Evanstonians for the wrongs of redlining and mortgage discrimination would have been more efficient, more equitable and a more accurate model of reparations than the city's current plan.""  Darity said municipalities such as Evanston and Asheville, which committed $2.1 million toward funding reparations in June, don't have the funding available to make true reparations.  ""If Evanston were to try to close the racial wealth gap for its current Black residents who would be eligible for reparations, we estimate it would require an expenditure of $3.3 billion. Contrast that with the city’s current budget of approximately $300 million,"" Darity said.  Former Asheville city council member Keith Young, who crafted the city's reparations resolution, said it does not specifically mention direct cash settlements or deposits to descendants of slaves in the city. A payoff would let the city ""off the hook,"" Young said, and that was not his intention.  ""If you give everybody a check and the money's gone, it doesn't mean that people get to wash their hands of everything and there are no systemic issues anymore,"" Young said.  Instead, Young said the resolution encourages ""forming policy and programs that will establish the creation of generational wealth and address reparations due in the Black community."" He's also hoping that local, state, federal and private donations will contribute to any funding.  Simmons remains committed to the reparations cause not only in Evanston but nationwide. After her one term on the Evanston City Council ended this year, she joined the nonprofit National African American Reparations Commission (NAARC).  Simmons said while there can be no real price tag on the cost for reparations, ""we are trying to help communities heal. We can project the economic impact and ways to address the wealth gap, housing, health and education inequalities as well as hold our Congress accountable for the passage of HR 40 and the demand for reparations.  ""But we have to start somewhere and reparations are a process,"" Simmons said. ""An ongoing process.""  It will never be perfect  Compensation for centuries of injustice can be defined in a variety of ways, and it may take trial and error to determine what initiatives will have the biggest impact, Perry says.  ""There’s no one form of reparation,"" he says, adding that the U.S. is in the ""very early stages"" of such efforts and they should be judged over a 5- to 10-year stretch.  ""The first few programs will never be perfect,'' Perry said. ""It is about taking a constructive approach to see the next iteration and the next.""  But the scholars, Robinson and Simmons all agree on this: Initially, there won't be enough reparation housing funding in Evanston to go around for eligible Black residents. Robinson said he already knows of a handful of households that plan to participate in the city's restorative housing program.  ""This has a chance to be very transformative,"" Robinson said.   Share your feedback to help improve our site!"
Fair Housing Act,One city plans reparation to Black homeowners. Will others follow?,Lohud.com | USA Today,Lohud.com,"One city plans reparation to Black homeowners. Will others follow?  When Morris “Dino” Robinson tried to refinance his house in Evanston, Illinois, in January, he was shocked to learn his first appraisal was $100,000 lower than a previous appraisal in 2017.  Robinson then sought a second estimate. It determined that the value of his home in Evanston’s fifth ward – a predominantly African-American part of town – had actually increased by $75,000 in that four-year span.  He signed the paperwork based on that appraisal last month, frustrated but not that surprised by the $175,000 swing in his property's value.  The first appraisal ""risked the equity of my home,” said Robinson, who is Black and is the executive director of the Shorefront Legacy Center, a nonprofit that archives the history of Black residents in Evanston and nearby north Chicagosuburbs. “Therefore, it jeopardized my net worth,"" he added. ""This is an ongoing and frustrating process for people like me that needs to end.”  Homes owned by Black residents have been undervalued for generations, Evanston officials say. Now, the Chicago suburb will try to make amends for that inequity by giving Black residentshousing assistance, a form of reparations —or financial compensation — paid by a government for the harm slavery and discrimination have caused generations of Black Americans.  Residents could begin applying later this month and disbursements could come as soon as this fall, said Robin Rue Simmons, the former Evanston city council member who sparked the idea.  The initiative pushes Evanston to the forefront of a nationwide discussion about whether reparations are owed to Black Americans, and if so, what form should they take.  Reparations initiatives around the nation  Reparation initiatives are also being discussed in other towns and cities including Amherst, Massachusetts,Iowa City, Iowa, and Asheville, North Carolina, where city council members voted unanimously last year to provide reparations to Asheville's Black residents and descendants of former residents now deceased. A city council-approved reparations commission is expected to report between January 2022 and April 2023 with final recommendations on funding and implementation.  In each of those cities, housing reparations are being specifically considered, whether in the form of assistance for homeowners or access to affordable housing.  ""We may not be the exact model other cities will follow,"" said Simmons about Evanston's plans. ""But, hopefully, we will inspire other cities to take the steps to dig into its history.""  Rayshawn Ray, a sociology professor at the University of Maryland and a fellow at the Brookings Institute who has written extensively about reparations, thinks that ""it could be argued that housing is probably the main avenue where funding for reparations should go.”  Creating generational wealth  Owning a home, Ray said, has long been a way to create generational wealth for families. Many households use the equity in their homes to get lines of credit to purchase other properties, help pay for their kids' college tuition, and even buy stocks, Ray said.  “And many Black families don’t have that and have been left out that process, whether it’s from discrimination to redlining,"" Ray said, referring to decades of discrimination in housing and home refinancing.  Though the federal government banned some racist housing practices during the 1960s and 1970s as part of the Fair Housing Act, which prohibits discrimination of the sale, rental and financing of housing based on a person's race, religion, national origin, sex, Black owners still face practices that devalue their homes and diminish their potential wealth.  That's according to an article co-written by Ray and Andre Perry, a senior fellow with the Brookings Institute and a residence-in-scholar at American University.  Homes in mostly Black neighborhoods are worth 23% less than homes of similar quality in neighborhoods with few or no Black residents, they say..  Assumptions about variousfactors, including housing and neighborhood quality, education and crime, result in homes in Black neighborhoods being undervalued by roughly $48,000 on average, which amounts to “a whopping $156 billion that these homeowners would have received if their homes were priced at market rates,” Perry and Ray say.  Arguments can be made that reparations are also owed to African Americans for biased criminal justice policies, education disparities and an ongoing lack of opportunities to own businesses.  “But, when it comes to municipalities, they know when it comes to housing they have some records clearly on file that show they discriminated against particular residents,” Perry said.  In the national reckoning on racism that followed the killing of George Floyd by a white Minneapolis police officer, municipalities ""are tired of sitting on their hands and not doing anything,'' Perry said. ""There's a whole generation of city leaders who refuse to let racism fester.""

Levins, Brandi Sica and Stephen Townsend.   I have told this story before:    When I became Chief Justice, I met for  the first time with all of the Assignment  Judges in the conference center at the  Justice Complex.  As I looked across the room, I could not help but  notice that I was the only woman there.  I wondered then, how the  “men” would react to the new “woman” Chief Justice.  What I   learned was that gender was not an issue, did not matter.  As we  worked together, as we planned and implemented court integration,  as we discussed our priorities for the years ahead, I understood   that those men—and later, there were women—would be both   colleagues and friends, and that I would treasure our relationships  and our time together.    Today we have greater diversity at every level of management  throughout the Judiciary and that is good.  Diversity  expands the perspectives and experiences we rely on  to find creative solutions to the problems that confront  us and to arrive at well-reasoned, thoughtful decisions.  Indeed, we have become stronger and wiser because  we are more diverse and because we reflect the   perspectives and experiences of the public we serve.  I am proud of all that we have accomplished in the past  ten years.  Judges, managers and staff, together, we  have worked toward a common goal — providing a fair  and efficient justice system for the people of New  Jersey.  I thank all of you, my judicial colleagues, the  staff in the vicinages and in the Administrative Office,  for your hard work and dedication.  Your commitment  does make a difference.  A Letter from   Chief Justice Deborah T. Poritz  I  2  This is the final annual report we have prepared  under the leadership of our Chief Justice, Deborah  T. Poritz.  In addition to providing an overview of our  accomplishments during the past court year, this  report highlights some of the longer-term goals that  we have attained during her term in office.    I have had the pleasure of working with Chief Justice Poritz not only as the acting  administrative director of the courts, but as a judge of the Appellate Division and,  before that, as the assignment judge in Mercer Vicinage.  Since her first day in  office, I have admired her wisdom, her intellect, and her equanimity.  She joined  the Judiciary just as statewide unification had begun in earnest, and she  approached every challenge and every hurdle with a steady hand and a clear vision  of the true goal of unification:  fairness.  Fairness so that no matter where in the  state a court was located, its judges and staff had adequate funding to ensure a   just resolution to every dispute.  Fairness so that no matter in which vicinage   court personnel worked, they each received equitable compensation for their   contribution.  Fairness so that no matter where a case was filed, the case would be  resolved according to a standard set of practices and procedures.    As a jurist, Chief Justice Poritz has earned respect from the legal community for  her thoughtful and well-reasoned opinions.  Her commitment to upholding the  law, regardless of the issue or political implications of the decision, has brought  justice to thousands of litigants and maintained the tradition of judicial excellence  for which New Jersey is well known.     In addition to thanking the Chief Justice for the pleasure of working  with her, I want to, once again, thank our hard-working judges,  Judiciary employees and staff for their commitment and dedication  during the past year.  One of the highlights of my past two years as  acting administrative director has been my meeting and working  directly with so many of the people who move the Judiciary forward  toward new goals of excellence and service.  As I complete the   second year of my work as acting administrative director, I become  more and more aware of just how fortunate I have been to work  with a wide variety of talented, enthusiastic and capable people.    I invite you to read this report and to share in our sense   of accomplishment.  A Letter from   Acting Administrative  Director Philip S. Carchman, J.A.D.  3  Retirement of Chief Justice Poritz  4  hief  hief Justice Deborah T.  Poritz was sworn into office  on July 10, 1996.  She is the  first woman to serve as  Chief Justice in New Jersey.  Born in New York on  October 26, 1936, she graduated  magna cum laude from Brooklyn  College.  She was a Woodrow  Wilson Fellow in English and  American Literature at Columbia  University before attending   graduate school at Brandeis  University.  From 1967 to 1970, she  taught English composition and  British literature courses at Ursinus  College in Collegeville, Pa.    Chief Justice Poritz received her  law degree from the University of  Pennsylvania Law School in 1977.  She began her legal career in the  New Jersey Department of Law  and Public Safety, where she held  numerous positions including  deputy attorney general and assis-  tant chief in the Environmental  Protection Section.  In 1982 she  was named deputy attorney   general in charge of appeals.  From 1984 to 1986, she also  served as chief of the Banking,  Insurance and Public Securities  Section.  In 1986 she was named  assistant attorney general and  director of the Division of Law.  She served in those positions  until 1989, when she became  chief counsel to Governor  Thomas H. Kean.    Chief Justice Poritz left public  service in 1990 and worked in pri-  vate practice until 1994, when she  was named attorney general by  Governor Christine Todd  Whitman.  She was appointed  Chief Justice by Governor  Whitman in 1996 and reappointed  by Governor James E. McGreevey  in 2004 .    C  Retirement of  Chief Justice Deborah T. Poritz   P  h  o  t  o  b  y  C  a  r  m  e  n  N  a  t  a  l  e    The New Jersey Supreme Court  has a long-established reputation  for progressive thinking and indi-  viduals’ rights, a tradition upheld  by the “Poritz Court.”  Here is a brief review of  some of the most notable  decisions authored by  Chief Justice Poritz on  behalf of the Court:    State in the Interest  of J.G., N.S. and J.T.  151 N.J. 565 (1997)  The Supreme Court ruled that a  convicted sex offender may be  required to submit to HIV testing  at the victim’s request.  Although  the defendant argued that the  testing would violate the Fourth  Amendment prohibition against  unreasonable searches and the  Fourteenth Amendment right to  due process, the Court ruled that,  given probable cause that the  offender may have exposed the  victim to HIV, the compelling  interest in protecting the health  of the victim outweighs the   defendant’s right to privacy.  N.J. Transit PBA Local 304  v. N.J. Transit Corp.   151 N.J. 531 (1997)  Defendant, New Jersey Transit  Corporation, adopted a drug and  alcohol testing policy that includ-  ed random testing of employees  responsible for safety-sensitive  functions in order to comply with  regulations promulgated by the  Federal Transit Administration.  Plaintiff New Jersey Transit PBA  Local 304 challenged the constitu-  tionality of the random testing  policy.  The Court held that   random drug testing of Transit  police officers did not violate the  state or federal constitutions.  As  employees of a highly regulated  industry responsible for safety-  Equally important, uniformity and standardization  have helped the courts to achieve unprecedented reduc-  tions in case backlog in every practice area.   Backlog  refers to cases that remain open beyond the self-imposed  time goals that the Judiciary has established for each  case type.  The reduction in the Judiciary’s backlog  reflects an increase in the number of cases that are  resolved in a timely manner by the courts.    Dale v. Boy Scouts   of America   160 N.J. 562 (1999)  Plaintiff had been a member of  the Boy Scouts of America (BSA)  since the age of eight, and had  attained the position of assistant  scoutmaster.  The BSA revoked  plaintiff ’s membership after a  newspaper article identified him  as the co-president of the Rutgers  Universty Lesbian/Gay Alliance.  Because the BSA is a public  accommodation under the New  Jersey Law Against Discrimination  (LAD), N.J.S.A. 10:5-51, and  because BSA revoked plaintiff ’s  membership based on his avowed  homosexuality, BSA violated the  LAD.  Plaintiff ’s membership did  not violate BSA’s First  Amendment Rights of Association  because plaintiff ’s presence in the  organization did not constitute  BSA’s endorsement of homosexu-  ality.  On review by the U.S.  Supreme Court, this ruling was  overturned.  J  ustice  sensitive functions, transit union’s  members were subject to   suspicionless drug testing when  the policy was carefully drawn to  protect plaintiff ’s members’   privacy rights.  In this context, the  state has a compelling interest in  public safety.    Planned Parenthood   of Central New Jersey   v. Farmer   165 N.J. 609 (2000)  The Court ruled that New Jersey’s  Parental Notification for Abortion  Act (N.J.S.A. 9:17A-a.a to –1.12)  unfairly restricted the fundamen-  tal right of a woman to choose  whether to have an abortion.  Because the state did not offer  adequate justification for   distinguishing between minors  seeking an abortion (when  parental notification was  required) and minors seeking  medical and surgical care relating  to their pregnancies (when  parental notification was not  required), the Court held that the  Act violated equal protection   principles set forth in Article I,  paragraph 1 of the New Jersey  Constitution.  Retirement of Chief Justice Poritz  5  Landmark Opinions  J.B. v. M.B.   170 N.J. 9 (2001)  A divorced couple disagreed over  whether preembryos held in   storage from a previous in vitro   fertilization attempt could be used  by the ex-husband to produce chil-  dren with another woman.  The  court ruled that the husband’s  right to procreate was not lost if he  was denied the opportunity to use  or donate the preembryos, and  that the wife could not be required  to become a biological parent, with  all its attendant consequences,  against her will.  The husband  could choose to keep the preem-  bryos in storage, or they were to be  destroyed.    Toll Brothers Inc. v.  Township of West Windsor  173 N.J. 502 (2002)  New Jersey’s Mount Laurel line   of cases obligates New Jersey  municipalities to provide for low  and moderate income housing in  their land use planning.  The Court  provided a builder’s remedy as an  enforcement mechanism for its  ruling.  The Legislature enacted  the New Jersey Fair Housing Law,  N.J.S.A. 52:27D-301 to –329, which  established a means for allocations  of a municipality’s fair share of low  and moderate income housing and  protection from the builders’   remedy by way of certification  from the Fair Housing Council.  After resolution of its original  Mount Laurel lawsuit, West  Windsor Township let its certifica-  tion lapse without building the  required units of affordable   housing.  The developer sued the  town, again seeking a builder’s  remedy.  The Court granted a  builder’s remedy after finding that  the Township of West Windsor had  violated the New Jersey  Constitution and the Fair Housing  Act by preventing a realistic oppor-  tunity for development of afford-  able housing through its   ordinances, regulations and site  requirements in respect of the  development of property.   New Jersey Democratic  Party v. Samson   175 N.J. 178 (2002)  Thirty-five days before the general  election, Senator Robert Torricelli  withdrew his name as the  Democratic Party’s candidate for  the United States Senate after   having won a place on the ballot in  the primary election.  Plaintiffs  sought to replace the Senator on  the ballot with another candidate  named by the Party.  N.J.S.A. 19:13-  20 provides an absolute right,  when a candidate withdraws up  until 51 days before an election, for  the candidate’s party to replace  him or her, provided it does so 48  days before the election.  The  Democratic Party was permitted to  place another candidate on the  ballot after the deadline in order to  provide the voters with a choice on  Election Day.  The Court deter-  mined that in the limited time  remaining election officials would  be able to prepare and mail absen-  tee ballots.  Sojourner v. New Jersey  Department of Human  Services   177 N.J. 318 (2003)  The plaintiffs in this case asked  the Court to find the Work First  New Jersey Act (WFNJ), N.J.S.A.  44:10-61(a), unconstitutional  because it ""caps"" the amount of  cash assistance given to families  receiving welfare, regardless of  any additional children they may  have.  The Court found that the  government cannot be required  to provide additional support to  families who have chosen to have  additional children after entering  the State welfare system.  State v. Fuller   182 N.J. 174 (2004)  A prosecutor exercised perempto-  ry challenges to excuse two  potential jurors, a minister and a  Muslim (based on the individual’s  dress and name). The prosecutor  claimed that he took exhibitions  of religious devotion as an indica-  tion of lenient tendencies toward  the defense, which, he argued,  was a permissible basis for exclu-  sion.  The Court held that the two  potential jurors were members of  a cognizable group and that the  prosecutor had failed to present  sufficient evidence of situation-  specific bias to justify the peremp-  tory challenges.  Raleigh Avenue Beach  Association v. Atlantic  Beach Club, Inc.  185 N.J. 40 (2005)   Under public trust doctrine, a pri-  vate beach club could not limit  the public’s access to its dry sand  beach area.  Under the doctrine,  the public must be permitted to  enjoy recreational activities on the  beach.  The Court based its ruling  on a prior long-standing public  access to and use of the beach, a  Coastal Area Facility Review Act  (CAFRA), N.J.S.A. 13:19-1 to –21,  permit issued to a condominium  project that required public  access to the beach, the lack of  publicly owned beaches in the  township, and the club’s use of  the beach as a business enter-  prise.   The club was permitted to  charge a reasonable fee to cover  expenses for lifeguards, trash  removal, and "
Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board,MSRB updates strategic plan for the post-COVID era,The Bond Buyer | The Latest,The Bond Buyer,"MSRB updates strategic plan for the post-COVID era  The Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board has published its strategic goals for the next four years, which includes the launch of EMMALabs, moving all of its data systems to the cloud and updating its rulemaking guidance.  The Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board's new strategic plan for the years 2022-2025 outlines the agency’s updated focus on market regulation and transparency, its handling of data and its role in upholding the public trust as a new chair prepares to assume his role Oct. 1.  Following the election of Patrick Brett to the role of fiscal year 2022 chair in July, the MSRB announced plans to release an updated strategic multi-year plan to help tackle and adapt to the changes markets have experienced, especially in the last year and a half. These updated goals are the agency’s first formal update since 2017.  “My main priorities for the year would be in the areas of technology and updating our rulebook,” said Brett, a managing director and head of municipal debt capital markets at Citi in New York who will become chair when the MSRB begins its new fiscal year Oct. 1. “We're in the process of a very large systems modernization project which is really meant to enable us to be even better stewards of the market’s data.”  Brett is a 19-year Citigroup veteran. He grew up in Northern Virginia, where, he says, public policy was in the air, predisposing him to public work from a young age. He has advanced degrees in both finance and South American archaeology, a personal passion of his.  The MSRB has always collected large swaths of data and made it freely available on EMMA, but Brett said the MSRB will be more focused on taking ownership of the quality of data it provides, highlighted in the launch of EMMALabs, happening later this year.  “You'll see a couple of the first things that will come out [with EMMALabs] will be the ability to do a full text search through the database, we'll be able to give people the primary market disclosure database as well as picking up the secondary market systems and visualizations of trading patterns,” Brett said. “But that will just be scratching the surface.”  The MSRB first discussed EMMALabs last year, describing it as a way to let stakeholders test drive new EMMA features under development.  Further plans for the agency’s management of data will be to expand search options on EMMA, something municipal analysts have had on their wishlists for many years.  The MSRB also plans to update its rulebook, including the voluminous interpretive guidance that accompanies some rules. The goal is to idenitify where rules could be amended to better reflect the industry today, and potentially even eliminate outdated requirements.  The board will also continue to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, having recently granted a two-week extension on Series 54 testing as part of that effort.  The fourth pillar of the strategic plan focuses on the regulator's committment to public trust.  “Underpinning everything that we do is upholding the public interest and making sure the market has integrity,” said Meredith Hathorn, a managing partner at the law firm of Foley & Judell in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Hathorn will assume the role of MSRB vice chair Oct. 1.  “And so in that area, some of the public trust issues that are coming up are obviously ESG and diversity, equity and inclusion.”  Hathorn said she feels the MSRB has a role to play in promoting racial justice in the market, referencing a revelation from a 2016 study that showed that historically Black colleges and universities pay an average of 20% more to access the market.  “I work with every HBCU in the state and I do see some of the disparities in the pricing,” Hathorn said. “The HBCUs usually end up going to the Department of Education for loans, rather than accessing the market.  “When we talk about the roles of all the entities in public finance, we want to be sure that our rules are not affecting MWBE's (minority and women-owned businesses) in a disproportionate manner,” she added. ”So really needing to understand how our rules either affect them, or what are their opportunities and challenges that they have in the marketplace.”  The MSRB recently underwent a governance review and shrunk its 21 member board down to 15 members, and well as instituting term limits.  On the ESG front, the MSRB will be focused on truth in advertising, as well as climate risk disclosures for the coming years. But there’s still much for them to learn on this emerging market segment.  “Clearly, from an investor protection perspective and market transparency perspective, there's just been an incredible growth and focus on this topic,” Brett said. “We are going out with a request for comment to gather information from market participants around this.”  The request for comment will be focused on addressing both truth in advertising around ESG marketing as well as recommendations around climate risk disclosures, due out in November or December of this year.  Following SEC chairman Gary Gensler’s testimony last week about the need to address efficiencies and transparencies in fixed income markets, the MSRB has been in talks with the Commission to help bring these markets into the future. The SEC serves as the MSRB's federal government oversight, and must approve changes to MSRB rules.  “We certainly see eye to eye on those goals,” Brett said."

The post Why XYPN Is Petitioning The SEC To Implement Title Reform Under Section 208(c) first appeared on Kitces.com.  Executive Summary  There is a fundamental difference between hiring an advisor, and hiring a salesperson. As while both have essential roles in the economy – sometimes we want the advice of a nutritionist about our red meat intake, and other times we simply want the butcher to sell us the best cut of meat – regulation has long recognized the importance of “truth in advertising” when it comes to those respective roles. Simply put, it’s important for advisors to communicate that they’re advisors and for salespeople to communicate that they’re salespeople (and not advisors), lest the consumer receive conflicted advice from a salesperson who isn’t actually trying to advise but simply wants to sell their product. Thus why nutritionists are subject to different rules than butchers, why doctors are regulated in a distinct manner from the drug industry, and why investment advisers are regulated in a different manner than brokers.  In fact, the entire genesis of the Investment Advisers Act – that forms the foundation for the fiduciary regulation of investment advice – was a stated intention by Congress to separate the “bona fide investment counselor” from the “tipsters and touts” looking to sell brokerage products under the guise of advice. Which, notably, didn’t mean limiting broker-dealers from engaging in the sales activities of brokering and dealing – which are foundational to the operation of the stock market and the function of capital formation in public markets – but instead was about separating the activities of advisors and brokers, by applying separate registration requirements for investment advisers, and higher (fiduciary) standards of conduct for those who registered as such.  To maintain this distinction, Congress also included in the Advisers Act under Section 208(c) a requirement that it wasn’t even permissible to use the “investment counselor” title, or to “represent as an investment counsel”, without actually being principally in the business of providing such advice services (and subject to the fiduciary standard that would apply to such advice). In other words, advisors weren’t permitted to advertise that they were advisors unless they agreed to be regulated as (fiduciary) advisors.  Yet in the 80 years since, the titles used to convey advice services have changed substantially, from what was once a relatively ubiquitous title of “investment counselor” to the more modern versions “financial advisor” or “financial consultant” or “wealth manager”. Notably, though, Section 208(c) of the Advisers Act regulates not just the title of “investment counselor”, but also the function of providing “investment counsel” services… which is just as relevant today as it was 80 years ago. Even though, in practice, the SEC does not regulate “financial advisor” titles today the way it regulated “investment counselor” decades ago.  At the same time, the growth of financial planning as a distinct profession alongside investment advice has created new regulatory challenges. In 2005, the SEC recognized this by declaring, similar to Section 208(c) for investment counsel, that those who either hold out as a “financial planner”, offer financial planning services, or deliver a financial plan to the client, cannot operate as brokers and must be regulated as fiduciary investment advisers. Yet when the 2005 rule was subsequently vacated by the Courts – for reasons unrelated to the regulation of financial planners – the SEC stated in a 2007 Proposed Rule that it would ‘soon’ revisit the regulation of financial planning. But 14 years later, the 2007 Proposed Rule is still just proposed.  Accordingly, this week XY Planning Network is filing a series of two Petitions for Rulemaking to the SEC, to take up again the 2007 Proposed Rule and its consideration of whether financial planning titles and services should automatically trigger fiduciary investment adviser registration, and to modernize Section 208(c) of the Advisers Act and better define in today’s environment what constitutes “investment counsel” services that would necessitate not just registration as an investment adviser but a requirement to principally be in the business of advice in order to market one’s services as such.  Because in the end, there remains an essential role for both advice and sales, and consumers should have the choice about whether to engage a salesperson to implement a desired purchase, or an advisor to help them select the right purchase to implement in the first place. But regulation of advice and sales begins with a fundamental truth-in-advertising obligation that advisors and salespeople advertise as such, so the end client understands the nature of the relationship that they are engaging to begin with. And so as the offering of financial advice services evolves, along with the marketing and other titles used to convey such services… it’s time for regulation to evolve with the times as well!"

Regulation Best Interest,"Regulators: Trading app nudges could be investment advice, trigger Reg BI",InvestmentNews | Compliance,InvestmentNews,"Mark Schoeff Jr.  Regulators: Trading app nudges could be investment advice, trigger Reg BI  The more individually tailored a communication to a customer is, the more likely it is a recommendation, SEC Commissioner Allison Herren Lee said during the NASAA fall meeting.  Nudges from trading apps that encourage investors to buy stocks could amount to investment advice and subject the online platforms to the Securities and Exchange Commission’s broker advice standard, regulators said Sunday.  SEC Commissioner Allison Herren Lee said Regulation Best Interest is triggered when an investment recommendation is made, a determination that’s based on facts and circumstances. One of the factors is whether a communication with an investor could reasonably be viewed as a call to action to trade in a particular security.  “The more individually tailored a communication is to a customer, I think, the more likely it may be to be viewed as a recommendation,” Lee said during a panel at the North American Securities Administrators Association fall meeting in Chicago.  Last month the SEC released a request for comment regarding “digital engagement practices” used by investment advisers and broker-dealers. The agency said it is looking into ways that advisers use tools that appeal to investors’ behavioral tendencies — such as game-like features known as gamification — to shape their activities on websites, portals and mobile apps.  Exploring whether digital apps encourage trading in riskier products, such as options, or trading that’s aligned with brokers’ rather than customers’ best interests and delving into compensation structures and conflicts of interest are areas the SEC should address, Lee said.  “I really look forward to hearing from retail investors and other market participants on this because it’s a really important area for us to focus on,” said Lee, who participated in the conference virtually via a video connection.  The question of whether Reg BI applies to a trading app is crucial not only to determining the reach and strength of the rule but also could have a profound affect on platforms like the popular one offered by Robinhood. The online brokerage, which is being sued by Massachusetts for violating the state’s fiduciary duty rule, maintains that it does not provide investment advice.  Maryland Securities Commissioner Melanie Senter Lubin said that when online brokers encourage customers to trade, they could be exceeding the bounds of the brokerage model.  “I’ve always wondered when do those nudges really take somebody beyond being a broker-dealer into being an investment adviser because they’re giving specific advice about a specific security, and isn’t that one of the provisions that puts you firmly in the investment adviser space [and] ups their obligation,” said Lubin, who is NASAA president-elect and spoke from the Chicago site of the state regulators’ conference.  The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority Inc. also is reviewing trading platforms and brokerages’ use of social media. It recently launched exam sweeps on how firms handle options accounts and how they use paid social media influencers — so-called “finfluencers’ — to attract new customers. It also is conducting a sweep on zero-fee trading.  “I think there is room for improving some of the rule set that we have in this space — for example, complex products, options,” Finra CEO Robert W. Cook said during the NASAA panel on Sunday, which he attended in person. “Are there appropriate disclosures — up to date — for the world we live in for investors? That’s one area I’ve asked our team to take a closer look at.”  EXTENDING REMOTE BRANCH INSPECTIONS  The panel of regulators also discussed a push by the brokerage industry to extend remote inspections of branch offices, one of the policy changes implemented during the coronavirus pandemic. Last week, Finra moved to continue the relief from on-site exams through next June.  Lee said the SEC has been hearing from registered reps and brokerages about a permanent policy change on in-person inspections.  “That’s something we’re looking at and thinking through,” she said. “To me, it seems certain that change is here, and we need to make sure we approach it wisely.”  Finra members have asked the regulator to reconsider the definition of a branch office and an office of supervisory jurisdiction after brokerages conducted their operations remotely during the pandemic.  “This is an area where a lot more thought is necessary,” Cook said. “It’s important that our rule book evolve, but those are pretty big lifts — to redefine what is an OSJ and what is a branch.”  Regulators: Trading app nudges could be investment advice, trigger Reg BI"

FAYETTEVILLE -- A Springdale man was sentenced to federal prison Friday after he testified in the fraud trial of two associates related to a failed wind farm project in Elm Springs.  Cody Fell, who worked at Dragonfly International for a time, pleaded guilty to federal wire-fraud and tax-evasion charges in December 2018.  U.S. District Judge Timothy L. Brooks sentenced Fell to 10 months in federal prison, followed by three years supervised release, and ordered Fell to pay $422,330 restitution.  Fell was also ordered to pay the IRS restitution of $30,185 and was ordered to file proper income tax returns in the future.  Until all the financial debts are paid, Fell is prohibited from opening bank or credit card accounts without prior approval of his probation officer.  He was allowed to remain free on bond until Oct. 20, when he is ordered to self-report to prison.  Fell agreed to plead guilty and to cooperate with the government. He testified against Jody Davis and Phillip Vincent Ridings at their fraud and money laundering trial.  Davis and Ridings were charged with nine counts of wire fraud, aiding and abetting wire fraud, money laundering, and aiding and abetting money laundering. Both men were found guilty on all counts on Sept. 3. They await sentencing.  Both Ridings and Davis, Dragonfly's CEO, were found guilty of conspiring to commit wire fraud. Both were also found guilty of four counts of wire fraud and aiding and abetting wire fraud.  Both men were also found guilty, jointly, of two counts of money laundering, and both were found guilty individually of another count each.  Fell, Davis' brother-in-law, said he was given more than $100,000 of investors' money by Davis and Ridings.  In a closing argument at the Davis and Ridings trial, Kenneth Elser, deputy U.S. attorney, told jurors Dragonfly was nothing but a long-term scam netting Davis, Ridings and others more than $700,000 between 2014 and 2018.  That figure doesn't include the losses suffered by people who did work for Dragonfly and were never paid or the person who was left holding a $2.3 million property loan.  Elser told jurors Davis and Ridings lied, concealed information, and used half-truths and fraudulent documents to lure investors, then they'd split the take and live on it. Investors were told their money was going to pay for specific work on a turbine design or prototype and models or studies, none of which were being done, he said.  Davis and Ridings of Dragonfly scammed six investors in Northwest Arkansas and southwest Missouri, according to an indictment. Investors lost amounts ranging from $13,000 to $300,000, the indictment claims. There were other victims in Iowa and Texas, according to prosecutors.  A lawyer for Davis tried to shift blame during the trial, telling jurors much of the fraud was perpetuated by Fell."
Fair Labor Standards Act,Hall of Fame trainer Steve Asmussen must pay $610K for...,Hardin County News | Updates,Hardin County News,"Hall of Fame trainer Steve Asmussen must pay $610K for...  The department’s Wage and Hour Division conducted the investigation of Asmussen and Asmussen Racing Stables underpaid the workers at stables and adjacent race tracks in Saratoga and Belmont, the department said.  The investigation found Asmussen willfully violated overtime and record-keeping requirements of the 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act. He and Asmussen Racing Stables failed to pay proper overtime to employees who worked more than a 40-hour work week, concealed hours worked by employees, directed workers to sign incomplete or false time sheets and failed to calculate the correct overtime pay owed to workers, the department said.  “Employers who shortchange their workers not only damage their employees; they also undercut their law-abiding competitors,"" said David An, the district director of the Wage and Hour Division District in Westbury, Long Island, in the release. ""Such violations are preventable if employers and workers know and understand their respective responsibilities and rights under the Fair Labor Standards Act.""  A consent judgment in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn ordered Asmussen and Asmussen Racing Stables to pay $563,800 in back wages and liquidated damages to the 170 workers. In a separate agreement with the department’s Office of Administrative Law Judges, Asmussen and KDE Equine must pay $46,200 in civil money penalties to the department due to the willful nature of the violations.  The order requires Asmussen to maintain adequate and accurate records of employees payroll and hours, adopt an electronic time-keeping system to ensure hours listed are accurate and train supervisors in New York of the requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act and their rights. He must provide it in English and Spanish.  Asmussen is permanently prohibited from future violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act and from retaliating or discriminating against employees who engage in protected activities. He cannot ask employees to work “off the clock” or kick back wages, the department said."
Hart-Scott-Rodino Act,Cadwalader Discusses FTC's About Face On Debt For Hart-Scott-Rodino Purposes,Mondaq | Recent Articles,Mondaq,"Cadwalader Discusses FTC's About Face On Debt For Hart-Scott-Rodino Purposes  Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP   To print this article, all you need is to be registered or login on Mondaq.com.   In a recent blog post, the Acting Director of the Federal Trade Commission Bureau of Competition announced the reversal of the Federal Trade Commission's (""FTC"") decades-long position regarding the treatment of debt repayment when determining whether a premerger notification filing under the Hart-Scott-Rodino (""HSR"") Act is required. Effective September 27, 2021, companies and individuals that do not file HSR based on excluding retired debt from the transaction value may face enforcement action. Perhaps even more concerning, the FTC also cast doubt in general on whether HSR practitioners may rely on past informal guidance from the FTC's Premerger Notification Office (""PNO""), stating that ""[t]hese informal interpretations are not reviewed or authorized by the Commission, and do not carry the force of law."" This is just the latest in a string of destabilizing blows to the framework of the HSR program, potentially raising the costs of doing mergers for both the parties and the government.  Background Information  Under the HSR Act, parties may not close transactions that meet certain dollar thresholds (adjusted annually) before filing a notification with the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (""DOJ"") and then observing a mandatory waiting period (typically 30 days) during which the agencies review the deal. The first test requires that the value of the voting securities, noncorporate interests or assets being acquired meets a minimum ""size of transaction"" threshold of $50 million (adjusted to $92 million for 2021). Transactions valued at or below this threshold are not reportable. If a transaction meets the ""size of transaction"" threshold, but is valued at or below $200 million (adjusted to $368 million for 2021), then a second ""size of parties"" test must be met. If both the ""size of transaction"" and ""size of parties"" tests are met, or if the transaction value is greater than $200 million (as adjusted), then the parties must make an HSR filing under the HSR Act unless an exemption applies.  The question of whether a particular transaction is reportable is complex and often cannot be resolved through reference to the HSR Act and its implementing regulations (the ""HSR Rules"") alone. When parties are unsure how the HSR Act and Rules apply to their transaction, they may contact PNO staff on a ""no names"" basis for guidance. The PNO fields ""hundreds of inquiries each week, and thousands every year, asking for interpretations of the HSR statute and rules."" Some informal interpretations with broad applicability are selected by staff for inclusion in the FTC's searchable database to be used as ""a reference tool [by those] with similar questions."" Although the PNO always has cautioned that its informal guidance does not constitute legal advice, parties and HSR practitioners counseling clients generally have been able to rely on interpretations included in the FTC's database, often contacting staff only to confirm that the FTC's position on a particular issue is consistent with the most recently published interpretations.  Reversal with Regard to Treatment of Debt Payoffs  In determining the transaction value of an equity acquisition, the FTC historically has not included amounts used to retire debt of the target company. So, for example, the $100 million acquisition of a target carrying $25 million in debt would be valued at $75 million and would not require an HSR filing. This makes sense as the repayment of the $25 million in debt does not flow to the sellers and thus is not treated as part of the consideration received in exchange for the sellers' stock. The FTC now has reversed its longstanding position, stating that, starting September 27, 2021, ""the Bureau will begin to recommend enforcement action for companies that fail to file when retirement of debt is part of the consideration for the deal."" The about-face with regard to debt payoffs appears to stem from a concern that parties are ""sidestepping the law"" by structuring deals to have the target take on debt before the acquisition so that the value of the debt retired by the acquiring party can be excluded from the transaction value. However, this scenario already would be prohibited by HSR Rule 801.90 as a ""device for avoidance,"" so it is unclear why the FTC deemed it necessary to reverse course on the treatment of debt payoffs.  The Acting Director's blog post refers readers to another FTC webpage for more details regarding the policy change. On this page, the FTC acknowledges that ""not all debt retired as part of a proposed transaction is consideration,"" and narrows the debt that must be included in calculating the HSR transaction value to any full or partial retirement of debt ""where selling shareholder(s) benefit from the retirement of that debt."" No guidance is given, however, as to what types of debt would and would not be included in the transaction value for HSR Act purposes.  Based on the Acting Director's blog post, it is reasonable to assume that the transaction value should include debt owed to or guaranteed by shareholders of the target (or affiliates or parent entities of either the target or the entity selling the shares) and debt incurred by the target to make distributions to selling shareholders (e.g., in leveraged recapitalizations). In addition, parties likely should include debt that was incurred recently or outside of the ""ordinary course."" Without additional guidance from the FTC, the only type of debt parties may feel comfortable excluding from the transaction value may be long-term debt owed to unrelated third parties that has not been guaranteed by a selling shareholder or its parents/affiliates. Otherwise, with HSR compliance missteps potentially resulting in fines of up to $43,792 per day, merging parties can fully mitigate risk only by including all other debt into consideration, resulting in more filings to staff that already is overwhelmed with a record number of HSR notifications.  Risky to Rely on Informal Interpretations?  Along with the HSR Act and Rules, the FTC's database of prior interpretations is an invaluable resource for HSR practitioners and the antitrust community. The FTC always has made clear that its informal advice does not have the force of law, but its interpretations generally represent the current thinking of PNO staff, who field thousands of requests for guidance on a ""no names"" basis in a given year. The published informal interpretations are an integral part of the HSR program, providing predictability and clarity for parties when determining their filing obligations and reducing the volume of questions to the PNO when recent informal guidance has been published for fact situations analogous to proposed transactions.  In her recent blog post, however, the Acting Director suggested that reliance on the informal interpretations provided by PNO staff ""outside of the formal rules"" may be misplaced, going so far as to rebuke those that rely on the FTC's prior interpretations ""as a substitute or supplement for their own legal analysis."" Stating the FTC's concern that some of the informal guidance ""may not reflect modern market realities or the policy position of the Commission,"" the Acting Director stated that the FTC is ""reviewing the voluminous log of informal interpretations to determine the best path forward."" It is unclear what that path forward will entail, but it appears to be part of the FTC's broader effort to revise its guidance to the public, including updating the HSR Rules (as we previously discussed in connection with the Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking announced in September 2020). It also is unclear whether the Acting Director's rebuke means that parties who directly solicit advice from PNO staff should not rely on staff's response, which, while specific to the facts of their transaction, still would be informal, ""not reviewed or authorized by the Commission"" and ""not carry the force of law.""  We hope that parties and HSR practitioners do not lose the ability to seek informal guidance from PNO staff, who are steeped in and are experts on HSR nuances, either directly by email or indirectly by reference to interpretations published on the FTC's website. Losing the informal interpretation program, or effectively gutting it, will make the HSR process less certain for potential filers and less efficient for the agencies which will have to handle even more HSR filings.  Key Takeaways  Proposed transactions involving debt payoffs should be evaluated carefully to determine reportability under the HSR Act. The FTC will begin enforcing its new interpretation relating to the retirement of debt for deals closing on or after September 27, 2021. In the absence of additional guidance from the FTC, parties should consider including in the HSR ""size of transaction"" all debt other than long term-debt to third parties unrelated to the selling shareholders or their parents and affiliates.  Reliance on informal interpretations may not shield parties from scrutiny or enforcement in proposed deals presenting analogous facts. Until the FTC has completed its review of the informal interpretation program and determined ""the best path forward,"" parties may wish to err on the side of filing, even where prior guidance might indicate that their transaction is not reportable or exempt.  Taken together with other recent FTC actions, these latest announcements may be further evidence of the HSR framework's ""death by a thousand cuts"" as recently warned by Republican FTC Commissioner Christine S. Wilson. The ""temporary"" and ""brief"" suspension in February of the granting of requests for early termination of the waiting period for transactions that raise no substantive concerns still continues. At the time, the agencies cited to the ""unprecedented volume"" of merger filings as one of the reasons for the suspension. Again citing to a ""tidal wave of merger filings,"" the FTC announced in early August that for deals it cannot fully investigate within the timeframes designated in the HSR Act, it will send form letters alerting merging parties that its investigations remain open, and that parties choosing to close those transactions do so at their own risk. Now, the FTC's about-face on the treatment of debt payoffs and its disavowal of the value of its own informal interpretations will inevitably lead to more HSR filings, increasing the burden on its already overwhelmed staff, and also inject further uncertainty into the HSR review process, increasing costs to merging parties and their customers.

Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Act”) [1]  and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,[2]  notice is hereby given that on September 14, 2021, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC” or “Commission”) the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by FINRA. FINRA has designated the proposed rule change as constituting a “non-controversial” rule change under paragraph (f)(6) of Rule 19b-4 under the Act,[3]  which renders the proposal effective upon receipt of this filing by the Commission. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.  I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change  FINRA is proposing to extend temporary Supplementary Material .17 (Temporary Relief to Allow Remote Inspections for Calendar Year 2020 and Calendar Year 2021) under FINRA Rule 3110 (Supervision) to include calendar year 2022 inspection obligations through June 30, 2022 within the scope of the supplementary material.[4]  The proposed extension of Rule 3110.17 is necessary to address the continuing operational challenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic many member firms face in planning for and timely conducting, during the first half of calendar year 2022, the on-site inspection component of Rule 3110(c) (Internal Inspections) at locations requiring inspection in calendar year 2022.  Below is the text of the proposed rule change. Proposed new language is in italics; proposed deletions are in brackets.  3100. SUPERVISORY RESPONSIBILITIES  3110. Supervision  (a) through (f) No Change.  * * * Supplementary Material: —————  .01 through .16 No Change.  .17 Temporary Relief to Allow Remote Inspections for Calendar Years 2020 and [Calendar Year] 2021 , and Through June 30 of Calendar Year 2022.  (a) Use of Remote Inspections. Each member obligated to conduct an inspection of an office of supervisory jurisdiction, branch office or non-branch location in calendar year s 2020 , [and calendar year] 2021 and 2022 pursuant to, as applicable, paragraphs (c)(1)(A), (B) and (C) under Rule 3110 may, subject to the requirements of this Rule 3110.17, satisfy such obligation by conducting the applicable inspection remotely, without an on-site visit to the office or location. In accordance with Rule 3110.16, inspections for calendar year 2020 must be completed on or before March 31, 2021 and inspections for calendar year 2021 must be completed on or before December 31, 2021. With respect to a member's obligation to conduct an inspection of an office or location in calendar year 2022, a member has the option to conduct those inspections remotely only through June 30, 2022. Notwithstanding Rule 3110.17, a member shall remain subject to the other requirements of Rule 3110(c).  (b) Written Supervisory Procedures for Remote Inspections. Consistent with a member's obligation under Rule 3110(b)(1), a member that elects to conduct [each of] its [calendar year 2020 or calendar year 2021] inspections remotely for any of the calendar years specified in this supplementary material must amend or supplement its written supervisory procedures to provide for remote inspections that are reasonably designed to assist in detecting and preventing violations of and achieving compliance with applicable securities laws and regulations, and with applicable FINRA rules. Reasonably designed procedures for conducting remote inspections of offices or locations should include, among other things: (1) A description of the methodology, including technologies permitted by the member, that may be used to conduct remote inspections; and (2) the use of other risk-based systems employed generally by the member firm to identify and prioritize for review those areas that pose the greatest risk of potential violations of applicable securities laws and regulations, and of applicable FINRA rules.  (c) Effective Supervisory System. The requirement to conduct inspections of offices and locations is one part of the member's overall obligation to have an effective supervisory system and therefore, the member must continue with its ongoing review of the activities and functions occurring at all offices and locations, whether or not the member conducts inspections remotely. A member's use of a remote inspection of an office or location will be held to the same standards for review as set forth under Rule 3110.12. Where a member's remote inspection of an office or location identifies any indicators of irregularities or misconduct (i.e., “red flags”), the member may need to impose additional supervisory procedures for that office or location or may need to provide for more frequent monitoring of that office or location, including potentially a subsequent physical, on-site visit on an announced or unannounced basis when the member's operational difficulties associated with COVID-19 abate, nationally or locally as relevant, and the challenges a member is facing in light of the public health and safety concerns make such on-site visits feasible using reasonable best efforts. The temporary relief provided by this Rule 3110.17 does not extend to a member's inspection requirements beyond [calendar year 2021] June 30, 2022 and such inspections must be conducted in compliance with Rule 3110(c).  (d) Documentation Requirement. A member must maintain and preserve a centralized record for each of calendar year s 2020 and [calendar year] 2021 , and for calendar year 2022 through June 30, 2022 only that separately identifies: (1) All offices or locations that had inspections that were conducted remotely; and (2) any offices or locations for which the member determined to impose additional supervisory procedures or more frequent monitoring, as provided in Rule 3110.17(c). A member's documentation of the results of a remote inspection for an office or location must identify any additional supervisory procedures or more frequent monitoring for that office or location that were imposed as a result of the remote inspection.  II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change  In its filing with the Commission, FINRA included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. FINRA has prepared Start Printed Page 52509summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.  A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change  1. Purpose  The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a host of operational disruptions to the securities industry and impacted member firms, regulators, investors and other stakeholders. In response to the pandemic, FINRA began providing temporary relief to member firms from specified FINRA rules and requirements, including Rule 3110. In June 2020, FINRA adopted Rule 3110.16 (Temporary Extension of Time to Complete Office Inspections), which has expired by its terms, that extended the time by which member firms must complete their calendar year 2020 inspection obligations under Rule 3110(c) to March 31, 2021, but with the expectation that firms would conduct their inspections on-site.[5]  FINRA subsequently adopted Rule 3110.17, which automatically sunsets on December 31, 2021, to provide firms the option of satisfying their inspection obligations under Rule 3110(c) remotely for calendar years 2020 and 2021, subject to specified conditions,[6]  due to the logistical challenges of going on-site while public health and safety concerns related to COVID-19 persisted. While there are signs of improvement, much uncertainty remains. The emergence of the Delta variant,[7]  dissimilar vaccination rates throughout the United States, and the uptick in transmissions in many locations indicate that COVID-19 remains an active and real public health concern.[8]  Through recent discussions with FINRA's advisory committees and other industry representatives, FINRA understands that while some firms have taken affirmative steps to develop and implement phased-in office re-entry plans based on local conditions, there are many other member firms that have not. Those firms continue to assess the complexity of when and how to effectively and safely recall their employees back into offices alongside fashioning permanent telework arrangements or a hybrid workforce model in which some employees may work on-site in a commercial office space and other employees may work off-site in an alternative location (e.g., personal residence).[9]  Many member firms, like other employers across the U.S., still maintain telework arrangements with their employees and have not resumed travel schedules at pre-pandemic levels as travel remains a risk, particularly for the segment of the U.S. population that is not fully vaccinated and for their families.[10]  Continuing health and safety protocols and policies regarding the opening of mass transit systems and schools in many areas also are key factors being considered by firms in developing their plans.  Against this setting, firms are trying to plan for calendar year 2022 inspections of their offices of supervisory jurisdiction, branch offices, and non-branch locations to comply with Rule 3110(c). The need for firms to establish inspection schedules for the coming year and ensure there is adequate, experienced staff available to travel and conduct on-site inspections within the context of fluid work locations presents a unique complexity for many firms in terms of planning and deploying resources. Even with increased availability of vaccines and other promising signs that the pandemic is receding in the U.S., FINRA understands that many firm personnel are still working from alternative work locations, and have not resumed traveling or are reluctant to do so at pre-pandemic levels amid persistent significant health and safety concerns.[11]  For unvaccinated persons in particular, health and safety risks in connection with returning to the office with other personnel still remain worrisome and travel still poses a risk of contracting and spreading COVID-19.[12]  As we are now late into the third quarter of calendar year 2021, FINRA believes extending Rule 3110.17 through June 30, 2022 represents a prudent accommodation.[13]  The proposed extension would provide clarity to firms on regulatory requirements and account for the time needed for many firms to carefully assess when and how to have their employees safely return to their offices in light of vaccination coverage in the U.S. and transmission levels of the virus, including any emergent variants throughout the country.  By extending Rule 3110.17 to cover part of calendar year 2022 inspection obligations through June 30, 2022 only, FINRA is not proposing to amend the other conditions of the temporary rule. Start Printed Page 52510The proposed amendments to Rule 3110.17 would simply provide that for calendar year 2022, a member has the option to conduct those inspections remotely through June 30, 2022. The current conditions of the supplementary material for firms that elect to conduct remote inspections would remain unchanged: Such firms must amend or supplement their written supervisory procedures for remote inspections, use remote inspections as part of an effective supervisory system, and maintain the required documentation. The additional period of time would also enable FINRA to further monitor the effectiveness of remote inspections and their impacts—positive or negative—on firms' overall supervisory systems in the evolving workplace.  FINRA continues to believe this temporary remote inspection option is a reasonable alternative to provide to firms to fulfill their Rule 3110(c) obligations during the pandemic, and is designed to achieve the investor protection objectives of the inspection requirements under these unique circumstances. Firms should consider whether, under their particular operating conditions, reliance on remote inspections would be reasonable under the circumstances. For example, firms with offices that are open to the public or that are otherwise doing business as usual should consider whether some form of in-person inspections would be feasible and appropriately contribute to a supervisory system that is reasonably designed to achieve compliance with applicable securities laws and regulations, and with applicable FINRA rules.  FINRA has filed the proposed rule change for immediate effectiveness. FINRA is proposing to make the proposed rule change operative on January 1, 2022.  2. Statutory Basis  FINRA believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the provisions of Section 15A(b)(6) of the Act,[14]  which requires, among other things, that FINRA rules must be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. In recognition of the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on performing the on-site inspection component of Rule 3110(c), the proposed rule change is intended to provide firms a temporary regulatory option to conduct inspections of offices and locations remotely during the first half of calendar year 2022. This temporary proposed supplementary material does not relieve firms from meeting the core regulatory obligation to establish and maintain a system to supervise the activities of each associated person that is reasonably designed to achieve compliance with applicable securities laws and regulations, and with applicable FINRA rules that directly serve investor protection. In a time when faced with ongoing challenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, FINRA believes that the proposed rule change provides sensibly tailored relief that will afford firms the ability to assess when and how to implement their work re-entry plans as measured against the health and safety of their personnel, while continuing to serve and promote the protection of investors and the public interest.  B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition  FINRA does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The potential economic impacts of Rule 3110.17 as described in File No. SR-FINRA-2020-040 continue to have applicability to the proposed rule change herein.

Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Act”),[1]  and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,[2]  notice is hereby given that on September 3, 2021, Nasdaq PHLX LLC (“Phlx” or “Exchange”) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC” or “Commission”) the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III, below, which Items have been prepared by the Exchange. Phlx filed the proposal as a “non-controversial” proposed rule change pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act [3]  and Rule 19b-4(f)(6) thereunder.[4]  The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.  I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change  The Exchange proposes to adopt new Phlx Options 10, Section 5, Branch Office, and Options 10, Section 17, Profit Sharing. The Exchange also proposes to amend General 9, Section 58, and Options 10, Section 6, Opening of Accounts.  The text of the proposed rule change is available on the Exchange's website at https://listingcenter.nasdaq.com/​rulebook/​phlx/​rules, at the principal office of the Exchange, and at the Commission's Public Reference Room.  II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change  In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.  A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change  1. Purpose  The Exchange proposes to adopt two new rules at Options 10, Section 5, Branch Office, and Options 10, Section 17, Profit Sharing. The Exchange also proposes to amend General 9, Section 58 and Options 10, Section 6, Opening of Accounts. Each change will be described below.  Options 10, Section 5  The Exchange proposes to adopt a new Options 10, Section 5, titled “Branch Offices.” Options 10, Section 5 is currently reserved. The proposed rule would be similar to Nasdaq BX, Inc. (“BX”) and The Nasdaq Options Market LLC (“NOM”) Options 10, Section 5. The proposed rule text would provide,  (a) Every OEF approved to do options business with the public under this Options 10 shall file with Phlx Regulation and keep current a list of each of its branch offices showing the location of each such office and the name of the manager of each such office.  (b) No branch office of an OEF shall transact options business with the public unless the manager of such branch office has been qualified as a Options Principal or General Securities Sales Supervisor; provided, that this requirement shall not apply to branch offices in which not more than three (3) representatives are located so long as the OEF can demonstrate to the satisfaction of Phlx Regulation that the options activities of such branch offices are appropriately supervised by a Options Principal or General Securities Sales Supervisor.  Similar to BX and NOM, Phlx would require every Order Entry Firm or “OEF” [5]  that is approved to do business with the public pursuant to Options 10 to file with Phlx Regulation a list of each branch office. The list must include the location of the branch office and the name of the manager of the office. The OEF must keep this list current. Further, an OEF must ensure that the branch office manager is qualified prior to transacting business with the public in the branch office. A manager must be registered as an Options Principal or General Securities Sales Supervisor, unless there are not more than three representatives in that branch office and the OEF can demonstrate to the satisfaction of Phlx Regulation that the options activities of such branch offices are appropriately supervised by an Options Principal or General Securities Sales Supervisor.  Currently, Phlx General 4,[6]  Section 1220(a)(8) [7]  and Supplementary Material .04 of that rule [8]  require the manager to be registered as an Options Principal or General Securities Sales Supervisor. In Start Printed Page 525372018, NOM's and BX's registration requirements [9]  were updated to mirror a similar change by FINRA.[10]  At that time, Phlx Options 10, Section 5 should have been amended to update the registrations applicable to a branch office manager to conform to the new General 4 registration requirements. The Exchange is proposing to make those amendments at this time.  The Exchange proposes to relocate Supplementary Material .08 to Options 10, Section 6 to proposed Supplementary Material .01 to Options 10, Section 5 and amend a citation within proposed Supplementary Material .01(vi) of Options 10, Section 5 from “(1)-(vii)” to “(i) to (vii)” to conform the numbering.  The proposed rule would permit Phlx to better regulate branch offices of member organizations [11]  by making clear within proposed Options 10, Section 5, related to doing business with the public, that an OEF that transacts business with the public must be qualified as a Registered Options Principal or General Securities Sales Supervisor. Further, the proposed rule explains that the requirement to be qualified as a Registered Options Principal or General Securities Sales Supervisor shall not apply to branch offices in which not more than three representatives are located so long as the OEF can demonstrate to the satisfaction of Phlx Regulation that the options activities of such branch offices are appropriately supervised by a Registered Options Principal or General Securities Sales Supervisor. This additional specificity will assist member organizations in complying with branch office requirements. Today, the Exchange has other rules to regulate supervision of branch office such as General 9, Section 20, Supervision. The addition of this rule, similar to NOM and BX, will permit Phlx to enforce the rule in a manner similar to NOM and BX by specifically requiring that members and member organizations that are doing business with the public maintain certain qualifications similar to NOM and BX. Members and member organizations that are required to comply with Options 10, Section 5 now have transparent information to determine if they have the appropriate manager qualifications. Also, the proposed rule makes clear when the requirement to be qualified as a Registered Options Principal or General Securities Sales Supervisor does not apply. The specified qualifications for branch managers will ensure branch offices are properly supervised by qualified individuals.  Options 10, Section 17  The Exchange proposes to adopt a new Options 10, Section 17, Profit Sharing. Options 10, Section 17 is currently reserved. The Exchange's rule is similar to FINRA Rule 2150(c),[12]  Sharing in Accounts; Extent Permissible.[13]  For purposes of comparing Phlx's proposed rule to FINRA's Rule 2150, the Exchange notes that the term “member” within FINRA Rule 2150 is equivalent to Phlx's defined term “member organization.” Phlx also utilizes an additional term, “member”,[14]  to define its floor membership. Each “member” on Phlx's trading floor is required to obtain a permit to conduct business on the trading floor.[15]  FINRA does not have a similar trading floor concept.  Similar to FINRA Rule 2150(c), Phlx proposes to prohibit members, member organizations, and associated persons from sharing directly or indirectly in the profits or losses in any account of a customer, however the rule does provide three circumstance within proposed Options 10, Section 17(a)(1) through (3) wherein a member, member organization, or person associated with a member organization may share in the profits or losses in such an account.[16]  Specifically, proposed Options 10, Section 17(a) permits a member, member organization, or person associated with a member organization to share directly or indirectly in the profits or losses in any account of a customer carried by a member, member organization, or person associated with a member organization, if prior written authorization is obtained as described in proposed subparagraphs (1) and (2) and the member, member organization, or person associated with a member organization shares in the profits or losses in any account of such customer only in direct proportion to the financial contributions made to such account by either the member, member organization, or person associated with a member organization as described in proposed subparagraph (3).  Proposed Options 10, Section 17(b) exempts from paragraph (a)(3) the accounts of the immediate family of such member, member organization, or person associated with a member organization. The rule proposes to define “immediate family” to include parents, mother-in-law or father-in-law, husband or wife, children or any relative to whose support the member, member organization, or person associated with a member organization otherwise contributes directly or indirectly.  Proposed Options 10, Section 17(c) permits a member, member organization, or person associated with a member organization that is acting as an investment adviser to receive compensation based on a share in Start Printed Page 52538profits or gains in an account provided certain conditions are met. Specifically, the member or person associated with a member organization seeking such compensation obtains prior written authorization from the member or member organization employing the associated person; and such member, member organization, or person associated with a member organization seeking such compensation obtains prior written authorization from the customer; and all of the conditions in Rule 205-3 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (as the same may be amended from time to time) are satisfied.  This proposal would enable Phlx to better regulate profit sharing arrangements of member organizations, members, and persons associated with member organizations by clearly specifying the manner in which a member organization, member, or person associated with a member organization may share in the profits or losses in such an account, describing what activity is exempt from the direct proportionate share limitation of proposed paragraph (a)(3), and delineating within proposed paragraph (c) how a member organization, member, or person associated with a member organization that is acting as an investment adviser may receive compensation based on a share in profits or gains in an account. Today, Phlx General 9, Section 7, Report of Financial Arrangements, permits Phlx to learn of such arrangements. The proposed rule would enable Phlx to restrict the ability to profit share to certain limited circumstances, similar to FINRA.  General 9, Section 58  The Exchange proposes to amend General 9, Section 58, Advertisements, Market Letters, Research Reports and Sales Literature, to amend the heading “Supplementary Material” to “Supplementary Material to General 9, Section 58” so the format of the heading is the same as other General 9 rules.  2. Statutory Basis  The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the provisions of Section 6 of the Act,[17]  in general, and with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act,[18]  in particular, in that the proposal is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.  Options 10, Section 5  The adoption of a new Options 10, Section 5, titled “Branch Offices,” is consistent with the Act and will protect investors and the public interest because the proposed rule explains the requirement to be qualified as a Registered Options Principal or General Securities Sales Supervisor and also explains when the requirement to be registered as such does not apply.[19]  General 9, Section 20, Supervision, does not offer the same specificity as proposed within Options 10, Section 5 with respect to branch offices, and General 9, Section 20 does not specifically apply only to members doing business with the public. The addition of this rule, similar to NOM and BX Options 10, Section 5, will permit Phlx to enforce the rule in a manner similar to NOM and BX by requiring certain qualifications for members doing business with the public. These qualifications for branch managers will protect investors and the public interest by ensuring branch offices are properly supervised by qualified individuals who will ensure compliance with the Exchange's rules. Today, Phlx General 4 requires member organizations, members, and persons associated with a member organization to have certain qualifications when conducting certain activity. These qualifications are designed to ensure that individuals have the necessary knowledge and experience to supervise persons employed by the member organization at a branch office. Proposed Options 10, Section 5 specifically requires that members and member organizations that are doing business with the public maintain certain qualifications. Members and member organizations that are required to comply with Options 10, Section 5 now have transparent information to determine which of the qualifications apply to a manager of a branch office and when those qualification apply.  Options 10, Section 17  Adopting a new Options 10, Section 17, Profit Sharing, similar to FINRA Rule 2150(c), Sharing in Accounts; Extent Permissible, is consistent with the Act. This proposal will protect investors and the public interest because it will clearly specify the way a member, member organization, or person associated with a member organization may share in the profits or losses in such an account. The proposal also will describe what activity is exempt from the direct proportionate share limitation of proposed paragraph (a)(3). Finally, the proposal will delineate within proposed paragraph (c) how a member, member organization, or person associated with a member organization that is acting as an investment adviser may receive compensation based on a share in profits or gains in an account. Members, member organizations, and persons associated with a member organization will have clear guidance on when profit sharing is permissible. Today, Phlx General 9, Section 7, Report of Financial Arrangements, permits Phlx to learn of such arrangements, and Phlx General 1, Section 1(c) does not permit members, member organizations, and persons associated with a member organization to engage in conduct inconsistent with just and eq"

Written notice shall include, but not be limited to, notice by electronic transmission, which means any process of communication not directly involving the physical transfer of paper that is suitable for the retention, retrieval and reproduction of information by the recipient. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered when deposited in the United States mail, addressed to the stockholder at his address as it appears on the stock transfer books or records of the Corporation as of the record date prescribed in Section 6 of this Article II, with postage thereon prepaid. If a stockholder be present at a meeting, or in writing waive notice thereof before or after the meeting, notice of the meeting to such stockholder shall be unnecessary. When any stockholders' meeting, either annual or special, is adjourned for thirty days, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given as in the case of an original meeting. It shall not be necessary to give any notice of the time and place of any meeting adjourned for less than thirty days or of the business to be transacted at such adjourned meeting, other than an announcement at the meeting at which such adjournment is taken.  SECTION 6. Closing Transfer Books; Fixing of Record Date. The board of directors shall have power to close the transfer books of the Corporation for a period not exceeding seventy days preceding the date of any meeting of shareholders, or the date of payment of any dividend, or the date for the allotment of rights, or the date when any change or conversion or exchange of shares shall go into effect; provided, however that in lieu of closing the stock transfer books, the board of directors may fix in advance a date, not exceeding seventy days preceding the date of any meeting of shareholders, or the date for the payment of any dividend, or the date for the allotment of rights, or the date when any change or conversion or exchange of shares shall go into effect, as a record date for the determination of the shareholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the meeting and any adjournment thereof, or to receive payment of the dividend, or to receive the allotment of rights, or to exercise the rights in respect of the change, conversion or exchange of shares. In such case, only the shareholders who are shareholders of record on the date of closing the transfer books, or on the record date so fixed, shall be entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the meeting and any adjournment thereof, or to receive payment of the dividend, or to receive the allotment of rights, or to exercise the rights, as the case may be, notwithstanding any transfer of any shares on the books of the Corporation after the date of closing of the transfer books or the record date fixed as aforesaid. If the board of directors does not close the transfer books or set a record date, only the shareholders who are shareholders of record at the close of business on the twentieth day preceding the date of the meeting shall be entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the meeting, and any adjournment of the meeting.  SECTION 7. Voting Lists. The officer or agent, having charge of the stock transfer books for shares of the Corporation shall make, at least ten days before each meeting of shareholders, a complete record of the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting or any adjournment thereof, arranged in alphabetical order, with the address of and the number of shares held by each. The record, for a period of ten days before such meeting, shall be kept on file at the principal office of the Corporation, and shall be subject to inspection by any shareholder for any purpose germane to the meeting at any time during usual business hours. Such record shall also be produced and kept open at the time and place of the meeting and shall be subject to the inspection of any stockholder for any purpose germane to the meeting during the whole time of the meeting. The original stock transfer books shall be prima facie evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to examine such record or transfer books or to vote at any meeting of stockholders.  - 2 -  SECTION 8. Quorum. A majority of the outstanding shares of the Corporation entitled to vote, represented in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of stockholders. If less than a majority of the outstanding shares are represented at a meeting, a majority of the shares so represented may adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified. The stockholders present at a duly organized meeting may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum.  SECTION 9. Proxies. At all meetings of stockholders, a stockholder may vote by proxy executed in writing by the stockholder or by his duly authorized attorney in fact, or by any other means of voting by proxy permitted under the General and Business Corporation Law of Missouri (or any successor law), including, without limitation, via facsimile, electronic or telephonic transmission. Proxies solicited on behalf of the management shall be voted as directed by the stockholder or, in the absence of such direction, as determined by a majority of the board of directors. No proxy shall be valid after eleven months from the date of its execution unless otherwise provided in the proxy.  SECTION 10. Voting. At each election for directors every stockholder entitled to vote at such election shall be entitled to one vote for each share of stock held by him. In all matters, every decision of a majority of shares entitled to vote on the subject matter and represented in person or by proxy at a meeting of stockholders at which a quorum is present shall be valid as an act of the stockholders, unless a larger vote is required by the General and Business Corporation Law of Missouri (or any successor law), the Articles of Incorporation or these Bylaws.  SECTION 11. Voting of Shares in the Name of Two or More Persons. When ownership of stock stands in the name of two or more persons, in the absence of written directions to the Corporation to the contrary, at any meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation any one or more of such stockholders may cast, in person or by proxy, all votes to which such ownership is entitled. In the event an attempt is made to cast conflicting votes, in person or by proxy, by the several persons in whose name shares of stock stand, the vote or votes to which these persons are entitled shall be cast as directed by a majority of those holding such stock and present in person or by proxy at such meeting, but no votes shall be cast for such stock if a majority cannot agree.  SECTION 12. Voting of Shares by Certain Holders. Shares standing in the name of another corporation may be voted by any officer, agent or proxy as the bylaws of such corporation may prescribe, or, in the absence of such provision, as the board of directors of such corporation may determine. Shares held by an administrator, executor, guardian or conservator may be voted by him, either in person or by proxy, without a transfer of such shares into his name. Shares standing in the name of a trustee may be voted by him, either in person or by proxy, but no trustee shall be entitled to vote shares held by him without a transfer of such shares into his name. Shares standing in the name of a receiver may be voted by such receiver, and shares held by or under the control of a receiver may be voted by such receiver without the transfer thereof into his name if authority to do so is contained in an appropriate order of the court or other public authority by which such receiver was appointed.  - 3 -  A stockholder whose shares are pledged shall be entitled to vote such shares until the shares have been transferred into the name of the pledgee and thereafter the pledgee shall be entitled to vote the shares so transferred.  Neither treasury shares of its own stock held by the Corporation, nor shares held by another corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to vote for the election of directors of such other corporation are held by the Corporation, shall be voted at any meeting or counted in determining the total number of outstanding shares at any given time for purposes of any meeting.  SECTION 13. Inspectors of Election. In advance of any meeting of stockholders, the board of directors may appoint any persons, other than nominees for office, as inspectors of election to act at such meeting or any adjournment thereof. The number of inspectors shall be either one or three. If the board of directors so appoints either one or three inspectors, that appointment shall not be altered at the meeting. If inspectors of election are not so appointed, the chairman of the board or the president may make such appointment at the meeting. In case any person appointed as inspector fails to appear or fails or refuses to act, the vacancy may be filled by appointment by the board of directors in advance of the meeting or at the meeting by the chairman of the board or the president.  Unless otherwise prescribed by applicable law, the duties of such inspectors shall include: determining the number of shares of stock and the voting power of each share, the shares of stock represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum, the authenticity, validity and effect of proxies; receiving votes, ballots or consents; hearing and determining all challenges and questions in any way arising in connection with the right to vote; counting and tabulating all votes or consents; determining the result; and such acts as may be proper to conduct the election or vote with fairness to all stockholders.  SECTION 14. Nominating Committee. The board of directors may appoint a nominating committee for selecting,or recommending to the board of directors for its selection, the management nominees for election as directors. Except in the case of a nominee substituted as a result of the death or other incapacity of a management nominee, the nominating committee or the board of directors shall deliver written nominations to the secretary at least twenty days prior to the date of the annual meeting. Provided such committee or the board of directors makes such nominations, no nominations for directors except those made by the nominating committee or the board of directors shall be voted upon at the annual meeting unless other nominations by stockholders are made in writing and delivered to the secretary of the Corporation in accordance with Section 15 of this Article II.  SECTION 15. Advance Notice Provisions for Business to be Transacted at Annual Meetings and Elections of Directors. (a) At any annual meeting of the stockholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall have been brought before the meeting (i) as specified in the Corporation's notice of the meeting, (ii) by or at the direction of the board of directors or (iii) by any stockholder of the Corporation who (1) is a stockholder of record on the date of giving the notice provided for in this Section 15(a) and on the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at such annual meeting, and (2) complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 15(a). For business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to clause (iii) of the immediately preceding sentence, the stockholder must  - 4 -  have given timely notice thereof in writing to the secretary of the Corporation and such business must otherwise be a proper matter for action by stockholders.  To be timely, a stockholder's notice must be delivered or mailed to and received by the secretary at the principal executive office of the Corporation by not later than the close of business on the 90th day prior to the first anniversary of the date of the preceding year's annual meeting and not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to the first anniversary of the date of the preceding year's annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is advanced by more than 20 days, or delayed by more than 60 days, from the anniversary date of the preceding year's annual meeting, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so received not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to the date of such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of (A) the 90th day prior to the date of such annual meeting or (B) the tenth day following the first to occur of (i) the day on which notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed or otherwise transmitted or (ii) the day on which public announcement of the date of the annual meeting was first made by the Corporation. No adjournment or postponement of a meeting of stockholders shall commence a new period for the giving of notice hereunder.  A stockholder's notice to the secretary must set forth as to each matter such stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting: (i) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting; (ii) the name and address of such stockholder as they appear on the Corporation's books and of the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; (iii) the class or series and number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation which are owned beneficially or of record by such stockholder and such beneficial owner; (iv) a description of all arrangements or understandings between such stockholder and any other person or persons (including their names) in connection with the proposal of such business by such stockholder and any material interest of such stockholder in such business; and (v) a representation that such stockholder intends to appear in person or by proxy at the annual meeting to bring such business before the meeting.  Notwithstanding anything in these Bylaws to the contrary, no business shall be brought before or conducted at an annual meeting except in accordance with the provisions of this Section 15(a). The officer of the Corporation or other person presiding over the annual meeting shall, if the facts so warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that business was not properly brought before the meeting in accordance with the provisions of this Section 15(a) and, if he or she should so determine, he or she shall so declare to the meeting and any such business so determined to be not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted.  At any special meeting of the stockholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to the Corporation's notice of the meeting.  (b) Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the following procedures shall be eligible for election as directors of the Corporation. Nominations of persons for election to the board of directors of the Corporation may be made at a meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected only (i) by or at the direction of the board of directors or (ii) by any stockholder of the Corporation who (1) is a stockholder of record on the date of giving the notice provided for in this Section 15(b) and on the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting, and (2) complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 15(b). Such  - 5 -  nominations, other than those made by or at the direction of the board of directors, shall be"

European Banking Authority,"Regulators not up to speed on banks' digital marketplaces, EU watchdog says",MarketScreener.com | All Latest News,MarketScreener,"Regulators not up to speed on banks' digital marketplaces, EU watchdog says  The European Banking Authority's warning is the latest sign that financial regulators are starting to pay more attention to Big Tech's increasing links with finance, such as in cloud computing. Finance and tech companies are coming closer together as banks set up digital marketplaces for products like payments and mortgages, as well as other financial and non-financial services, a process which has accelerated since the pandemic began. This means customers can make payments or buy things using their mobile phone which links directly to their bank account. This so-called platformisation helps banks to cut costs and reach a wider range of customers, and includes partnerships with tech groups. Apple Pay, for example, allows banks' debit and credit card holders to set up an Apple wallet to make payments. Google and Citi have teamed up to enable users of the Google Pay app to open a checking account with Citi. But the EU watchdog said reliance on digital platforms for marketing and distribution of services creates new forms of financial, operational and reputational interdependencies. The trend is posing ""some challenges"" for regulators in monitoring market developments and any risks from these interdependencies, the watchdog said. ""Indeed, it appears that the vast majority of competent authorities currently have a limited understanding of platform-based business models,"" EBA said. EBA said it proposes to develop a framework next year to collect information about dependencies among banks on digital platforms, and create indicators to assess potential concentration, contagion and systemic risks. But it said new legislation is not needed at this stage. The watchdog called on the EU to update guidance on when a digital activity should be considered a crossborder provision of services and therefore come under EU and national laws that require information to be reported to regulators to improve visibility.

Federal Insurance Contributions Act,Fleming sentencing moves to October,CapeGazette.com | A&E | All Column Posts,CapeGazette,"Fleming sentencing moves to October  The sentencing for local photographer Kevin Fleming has been continued to October.  Fleming was scheduled for sentencing Sept. 16, but the U.S. District Court moved the date to Tuesday, Oct. 26, in Wilmington.  In August 2020, Fleming entered a plea agreement, agreeing to plead guilty to one count of tax evasion in return for dismissal of the remaining 15 counts of felony tax charges he was facing.  Under the plea agreement for the tax-evasion count, Fleming could be sentenced to five years in prison and fined $250,000, with the final amount to be determined by U.S. District Court Judge Richard G. Andrews..  Fleming was indicted in November 2019 on 16 counts of felony tax charges. The indictment filed in U.S. District Court states Fleming willfully attempted to evade and defeat federal income tax by diverting funds from his corporate Portfolio Books Inc. account to pay for personal expenses from 2012 to 2016. During an interview with a special agent of the Internal Revenue Service, the indictment states, Fleming told the agent he set up the corporation, but falsely told the agent that the corporation was not a real entity because it had no employees, assets or bank accounts. Fleming faces five counts of tax evasion in connection with diverting funds from his corporations to pay for personal expenses.  According to court records, Fleming did not file federal tax returns for his gross income from 2013 to 2016. He also deducted federal income tax and Federal Insurance Contributions Act taxes – known as FICA taxes – from his employees' paychecks, but he kept the money instead of sending it to the IRS. In 2016 and 2017, he failed to pay quarterly taxes totaling $22,584.  Before his plea agreement, Fleming faced four counts of failure to file a federal tax return, seven counts of failure to pay federal employee taxes, and five counts of tax evasion, totaling at least 80 years in prison and at least $4 million in fines.  The plea agreement requires Fleming to file proper tax returns for 2012 to 2016, cooperate with any civil tax audit, and pay back taxes with any interest and penalties.  Failure to provide complete, accurate and timely information would void Fleming's plea agreement and could result in obstruction of justice charges that would increase his sentence, the plea agreement states. If that happens, the plea agreement could also be completely voided."

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:   Proposed Project   Nursing Home Survey on Patient Safety   Culture Database   In 1999, the Institute of Medicine   called for health care organizations to   develop a ‘‘culture of safety’’ such that   their workforce and processes focus on   improving the reliability and safety of   care for patients (IOM, 1999;   To Err is   Human: Building a Safer Health   System  ). To respond to the need for   tools to assess patient safety culture in   health care, AHRQ developed and pilot   tested the Nursing Home Survey on   Patient Safety Culture with OMB   approval (OMB NO. 0935–0132;   Approved July 5, 2007).   The survey is designed to enable   nursing homes to assess provider and   staff perspectives about patient safety   issues, medical error, and error   reporting and includes 42 items that   measure 12 composites of patient safety   culture. AHRQ made the survey   publicly available along with a Survey   User’s Guide and other toolkit materials   in November 2008 on the AHRQ   website.   The AHRQ Nursing Home SOPS   Database consists of data from the   AHRQ Nursing Home Survey on Patient   Safety Culture. Nursing homes in the   U.S. can voluntarily submit data from   the survey to AHRQ through its   contractor, Westat. The Nursing Home   SOPS Database (OMB NO. 0935–0195,   last approved on November 5, 2018) was   developed by AHRQ in 2011 in   response to requests from nursing   VerDate Sep<11>2014  21:36 Sep 20, 2021 Jkt 253001 PO 00000 Frm 00034 Fmt 4703 Sfmt 4703 E:\FR\FM\21SEN1.SGM 21SEN1  lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with NOTICES1  52472    Federal Register   / Vol. 86, No. 180 / Tuesday, September 21, 2021 / Notices   homes interested in viewing their   organizations’ patient safety culture   survey results. Those organizations   submitting data receive a feedback   report, as well as a report on the   aggregated de-identified findings of the   other nursing homes submitting data.   These reports are used to assist nursing   home staff in their efforts to improve   patient safety culture in their   organizations.   Rationale for the information   collection.   The Nursing Home SOPS and   Nursing Home SOPS Database support   AHRQ’s goals of promoting   improvements in the quality and safety   of health care in nursing home settings.   The survey, toolkit materials, and   database results are all made publicly   available on AHRQ’s website. Technical   assistance is provided by AHRQ through   its contractor at no charge to nursing   homes, to facilitate the use of these   materials for nursing home patient   safety and quality improvement.   This database:   (1) Presents results from nursing   homes that voluntarily submit their   data,   (2) Provides data to nursing homes to   facilitate internal assessment and   learning in the patient safety   improvement process, and   (3) Provides supplemental   information to help nursing homes   identify their strengths and areas with   potential for improvement in patient   safety culture.   This study is being conducted by   AHRQ through its contractor, Westat,   pursuant to AHRQ’s statutory authority   to conduct and support research on   health care and on systems for the   delivery of such care, including   activities with respect to the quality,   effectiveness, efficiency,   appropriateness and value of healthcare   services and with respect to surveys and   database development. 42 U.S.C   299a(a)(1) and (8).   Method of Collection   To achieve the goal of this project the   following activities and data collections   will be implemented:   (1)   Eligibility and Registration Form—   The nursing home (or parent   organization) point-of-contact (POC)   completes a number of data submission   steps and forms, beginning with the   completion of an online Eligibility and   Registration Form. The purpose of this   form is to collect basic demographic   information about the nursing home and   initiate the registration process.   (2)   Data Use Agreement  —The   purpose of the data use agreement,   completed by the nursing home POC, is   to state how data submitted by nursing   homes will be used and provides   privacy assurances.   (3)   Nursing Home Site Information   Form  —The purpose of the site   information form, completed by the   nursing home POC, is to collect   background characteristics of the   nursing home. This information will be   used to analyze data collected with the   Nursing Home SOPS survey.   (4)   Data File(s) Submission  —POCs   upload their data file(s) using the data   file specifications, to ensure that users   submit standardized and consistent data   in the way variables are named, coded   and formatted. The number of   submissions to the database is likely to   vary each year because nursing homes   do not administer the survey and submit   data every year. Data submission is   typically handled by one POC who is   either a corporate level health care   manager for a Quality Improvement   Organization (QIO), a survey vendor   who contracts with a nursing home to   collect their data, or a nursing home   Director of Nursing or nurse manager.   POCs submit data on behalf of 3 nursing   homes, on average, because many   nursing homes are part of a QIO or   larger nursing home or health system   that includes many nursing home sites,   or the POC is a vendor that is submitting   data for multiple nursing homes.   Estimated Annual Respondent Burden   Exhibit 1 shows the estimated   annualized burden hours for the   respondents’ time to participate in the   database. An estimated 40 POCs, each   representing an average of 3 individual   nursing homes each, will complete the   database submission steps and forms.   Each POC will submit the following:   52473   Federal Register   / Vol. 86, No. 180 / Tuesday, September 21, 2021 / Notices   E  XHIBIT   2—E  STIMATED   A  NNUALIZED   C  OST   B  URDEN  —Continued   Form name   Number of   respondents/   POCs   Total   burden hours   Average   hourly   wage rate *   Total cost   burden   Total ..........................................................................................................

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:   Proposed Project   Nursing Home Survey on Patient Safety   Culture Database   In 1999, the Institute of Medicine   called for health care organizations to   develop a ‘‘culture of safety’’ such that   their workforce and processes focus on   improving the reliability and safety of   care for patients (IOM, 1999;   To Err is   Human: Building a Safer Health   System  ). To respond to the need for   tools to assess patient safety culture in   health care, AHRQ developed and pilot   tested the Nursing Home Survey on   Patient Safety Culture with OMB   approval (OMB NO. 0935–0132;   Approved July 5, 2007).   The survey is designed to enable   nursing homes to assess provider and   staff perspectives about patient safety   issues, medical error, and error   reporting and includes 42 items that   measure 12 composites of patient safety   culture. AHRQ made the survey   publicly available along with a Survey   User’s Guide and other toolkit materials   in November 2008 on the AHRQ   website.   The AHRQ Nursing Home SOPS   Database consists of data from the   AHRQ Nursing Home Survey on Patient   Safety Culture. Nursing homes in the   U.S. can voluntarily submit data from   the survey to AHRQ through its   contractor, Westat. The Nursing Home   SOPS Database (OMB NO. 0935–0195,   last approved on November 5, 2018) was   developed by AHRQ in 2011 in   response to requests from nursing   VerDate Sep<11>2014  21:36 Sep 20, 2021 Jkt 253001 PO 00000 Frm 00034 Fmt 4703 Sfmt 4703 E:\FR\FM\21SEN1.SGM 21SEN1  lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with NOTICES1  "

In short, the Regulations define the terms ‘parent undertaking’ and ‘group’ for the purposes of Part 9C of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, which gives the FCA powers to make rules in relation to parent undertakings of FCA-regulated firms (whether the parent is itself authorised or not). They will “support the effective management of the risks faced by UK investment firm groups that are FCA regulated” and assist with “the operation of an effective and proportionate Investment Firm Prudential Regime,” as introduced by the Financial Services Act 2021.  The Regulations come into force on 6 October 2021.

Points of interest in the responses include the following:  HM Treasury considers that the existing arrangements for examining and, where relevant, amending the regulatory perimeter are effective and therefore considers it unnecessary to provide the FCA with a formal power to recommend changes to the regulatory perimeter;  HM Treasury is continuing to explore additional legislative and non-legislative solutions to tackle fraud in the round; and  the FCA will continue to consider whether further rule changes are required to prevent consumers from getting a misleading impression about the regulatory protections from which they benefit.

In May 2021, the European Banking Authority (EBA) published final draft RTS, mandated under Article 78(3) of the CRR, on the permission regime to be applied as of 1 January 2022. However, the delegated regulation containing the RTS is unlikely to be finalised before 1 January 2022, which is the deadline for institutions to comply with the intermediate minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) targets set under the Single Resolution Mechanism Regulation (806/2014/EU).  In the communication, the SRB sets out guidance on the procedures that need to be followed when seeking the SRB’s permission to call, redeem, repay or repurchase eligible liabilities instruments before their contractual maturity for the purposes of article 77(2) of the CRR. The guidance covers:  the scope of the Article 77 requirement for institutions and instruments;  the process for making an application the SRB; and  the type of permission and requirements, with guidance on applications for ad hoc permissions and for general prior permissions.  The SRB will update the communication if any parts of the draft RTS are changed when the European Commission endorses the Delegated Regulation.

The revised guidelines require DGSs to stress test, among other things, their ability to access all of their funding sources, including extraordinary ex post contributions and alternative funding arrangements. They also encourage DGSs to choose stress-testing scenarios with additional business continuity challenges or circumstances that create extra stress, such as a pandemic, technology failures or other similar events.  The revised guidelines will apply from 15 September 2021.  Final Report on the Revised Guidelines on stress tests of deposit guarantee schemes under Directive 2014/49/EU repealing and replacing Guidelines EBA/GL/2016/04 (EBA/GL/2021/10)  Annex  Press release  CRR - EBA publishes final report on guidelines to assess breaches of the large exposure limits - 15 September 2021  The EBA has published a final report (EBA/GL/2021/09) with its guidelines specifying the criteria for assessing the exceptional cases when institutions exceed the large exposure limits in Article 395(1) of the Capital Requirements Regulation (575/2013/EU) (CRR) and the time and measures required to return to compliance under Article 396(3) of that Regulation.  The EBA consulted on a draft version of the guidelines in February 2021. Feedback has led to some minor amendments to the initial proposal.  The guidelines will be translated into the official EU languages and published on the EBA website. The deadline for competent authorities to report whether they comply with the guidelines will be two months after the publication of the translations.  The guidelines will apply from 1 January 2022.

Overall, the PRA has found significant deficiencies in a number of firms’ processes for delivering accurate and reliable regulatory returns, resulting in an increased risk of material misstatements. In its letter, the PRA sets out its material findings in relation to governance and ownership, controls, and data and investment, flagging among other things the importance of overall oversight of the regulatory reporting process by a senior manager and an effective and robust control framework.  The PRA intends to follow up with relevant firms on specific findings from their skilled person reviews, and expects firms to put in place remediation plans that are strategic, appropriately resourced and address the root causes of the issues. The PRA further expects all banks, designated investment firms and building societies to consider its findings as set out in the letter, and any steps they may need to take to improve their governance, controls and data related to regulatory reporting.  Dear CEO Letter: Thematic findings on the reliability of regulatory reporting  Financial holding companies - PRA publishes Policy Statement (PS20/21) on regulatory framework - 15 September 2021  The PRA has published a Policy Statement (PS20/21) setting out final rules on the application of existing consolidated prudential requirements to financial holding companies and mixed financial holding companies (FHCs) that have been approved or designated in accordance with the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (FSMA).  Following the UK’s implementation of the Fifth Capital Requirements Directive ((EU) 2019/878) (CRR), holding companies in UK banking groups are subject to supervisory approval and consolidated supervision under a legislative framework set out in Part 12B of FSMA, (as amended by The Financial Holding Companies (Approval etc.) and Capital Requirements (Capital Buffers and Macro-prudential Measures) (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020). A UK consolidation group’s approved parent holding company is responsible for ensuring that consolidated prudential requirements are met. If the relevant holding company cannot be approved, another group entity may be temporarily designated as responsible for ensuring that the requirements are met. The Financial Services Act 2021 (FSA) gave the PRA the power to make rules relating to approved or designated holding companies. The PRA consulted on its proposals in June 2021 in Consultation Paper (CP12/21) ‘Financial holding companies: Further implementation’. It received no responses to that consultation and the PRA has made no changes to the draft policy.  The Appendices to the Policy Statement set out final versions of:  the PRA Rulebook: CRR firms: PRA (Rules Applying to Holding Companies) Instrument 2021 (PRA 2021/11);  Statement of Policy (SoP): Supervisory measures and penalties in relation to financial holding companies; and  updated Statement of Policy: The PRA’s approach to enforcement: statutory statements of policy and procedure.  The instrument comes into force on 17 September 2021, except rule 4.1 in Annex F (Groups), which comes into force on 1 January 2022. The Policy Statement and the SoPs take effect on 15 September 2021.

This follows the publication by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) of a final report and draft RTS in October 2019. The Commission was delayed in endorsing the draft RTS due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.  The Commission has also published an Annex, which contains a template for co-operation arrangements relating to the exchange of information between EU national competent authorities with third country authorities and the enforcement of obligations arising under MAR in third countries.  The Council of the EU and the European Parliament will now scrutinise the Delegated Regulation.

Once a system, which is not subject to UK law, has been designated under the UK SFR, the Bank will monitor that the system continues to meet the requirements for designation. The requirements include:  a system must have at least three institutions participating in the system, unless otherwise determined by the Bank, and be a system through which transfer orders are effected;  a system must have adequate arrangements for the effective monitoring and enforcement of compliance with its rules;  a system operator must have financial resources sufficient for the proper performance of its functions;  a system operator must be able and willing to co-operate with the relevant UK supervisory and administrative authorities; and  a system must have default arrangements, which are appropriate for that system in all the circumstances.  The Bank has also set out its requirements relating to the notifications and information gathering.

Federal Insurance Contributions Act,Fleming sentencing moves to October,CapeGazette.com | Recent News,CapeGazette,"Fleming sentencing moves to October  The sentencing for local photographer Kevin Fleming has been continued to October.  Fleming was scheduled for sentencing Sept. 16, but the U.S. District Court moved the date to Tuesday, Oct. 26, in Wilmington.  In August 2020, Fleming entered a plea agreement, agreeing to plead guilty to one count of tax evasion in return for dismissal of the remaining 15 counts of felony tax charges he was facing.  Under the plea agreement for the tax-evasion count, Fleming could be sentenced to five years in prison and fined $250,000, with the final amount to be determined by U.S. District Court Judge Richard G. Andrews..  Fleming was indicted in November 2019 on 16 counts of felony tax charges. The indictment filed in U.S. District Court states Fleming willfully attempted to evade and defeat federal income tax by diverting funds from his corporate Portfolio Books Inc. account to pay for personal expenses from 2012 to 2016. During an interview with a special agent of the Internal Revenue Service, the indictment states, Fleming told the agent he set up the corporation, but falsely told the agent that the corporation was not a real entity because it had no employees, assets or bank accounts. Fleming faces five counts of tax evasion in connection with diverting funds from his corporations to pay for personal expenses.  According to court records, Fleming did not file federal tax returns for his gross income from 2013 to 2016. He also deducted federal income tax and Federal Insurance Contributions Act taxes – known as FICA taxes – from his employees' paychecks, but he kept the money instead of sending it to the IRS. In 2016 and 2017, he failed to pay quarterly taxes totaling $22,584.  Before his plea agreement, Fleming faced four counts of failure to file a federal tax return, seven counts of failure to pay federal employee taxes, and five counts of tax evasion, totaling at least 80 years in prison and at least $4 million in fines.  The plea agreement requires Fleming to file proper tax returns for 2012 to 2016, cooperate with any civil tax audit, and pay back taxes with any interest and penalties.  Failure to provide complete, accurate and timely information would void Fleming's plea agreement and could result in obstruction of justice charges that would increase his sentence, the plea agreement states. If that happens, the plea agreement could also be completely voided."
US AML Regulations,Crime Traveler: Did George Revelle kill his wife?,Ozarks First | News,Ozarks First,"Crime Traveler: Did George Revelle kill his wife?  For the next month, police searched Revelle’s home for a .45 caliber pistol. They didn’t find it but did find a letter. It was from Lisa to George stating, “I can’t continue living this way. I’m afraid of you, afraid of your anger, and your silence.”  On March 31st, 1995, the FBI’s investigation into Revelle’s finances revealed he had been embezzling more than $54,000 from Ozark Bank, where he was vice-president. A federal grand jury hands down 18 indictments against Revelle.  Four days later, the Christian County grand jury indicts Revelle on first-degree murder charges. Prosecutors believed Revelle killed his wife to collect a half a million-dollar life insurance policy. He pleads guilty to federal embezzlement and money laundering charges.  On September 7, 1995, the day he was to be sentenced on the federal conviction, an anonymous letter arrived in the Christian County Sheriff’s Office. The letter said the murder weapon could be found in a pond and specific directions were given toward Warren County. The letter also stated Revelle was innocent and that Lisa’s death was a botched extortion attempt that was planned by George’s half-brother, who had been killed in a car accident two weeks prior to the murder.  The police were able to find the gun that was used to shoot Lisa Revelle with the anonymous letter. The gun was wrapped in duct tape and was located on George’s half-brother’s rented land. The letter would later be analyzed for any DNA evidence. No connection to Revelle was found.  He began his 27-month prison sentence on the embezzlement plea in October 1995.  The Trial  While serving that sentence, in the spring of 1996, George went on trial for Lisa’s murder. The prosecution said it would show that George murdered his wife to free himself from debt. In the opening statement, prosecutors revealed that George purchased a life insurance policy on Lisa making himself the sole beneficiary.  According to the case files, Revelle spoke to co-workers about a .45 caliber gun and had inconsistencies in the story regarding the intruders. The prosecution used the letter written by Lisa Revelle to George to show Lisa’s dissatisfaction with the state of their marriage. It was written six months prior to Lisa’s death.  Among other witnesses, an alarm company technician testified that Revelle’s account of how his alarm went off the night of the killing wasn’t possible. Revelle said he woke up at the sound of the alarm. The technician testified only one alarm went off and was triggered by a gunshot.  “Cannot be counted on to tell the truth.”  – Prosecutor Kenny Hulshof, in his closing argument, counting Revelle  The Verdict  The Appeal  In November 1997, the Missouri Court of Appeals vacated the conviction, ruling that the letter written by Lisa Revelle six months prior to the murder was inadmissible hearsay and should not have been admitted into evidence.  Attorney Shawn Askinosie, who handled Revelle’s appeal after his trial lawyer retired, took over Revelle’s defense at his second trial.  The retrial began in December 1998.  Askinosie discovered that two of the photographs taken at the autopsy were missing. He located the negatives and saw that the photographs showed a detective with his hand over the victim’s nude breast. He further attacked the sheriff’s department’s belief Revelle hid the murder weapon despite failing to find the gun in the home with investigators spending more than 1,000 hours in the home looking for clues.  He asked a finance expert to testify that Revelle was not hopelessly in debt, but rather his situation would have been resolved with the bonuses and other payments he expected to receive later in the year.  Askinosie had an alarm expert use a replica of Revelle’s system to show how an intruder could have gotten into the home and the display would still function as the police originally found it the morning of the murder. The alarm expert said Revelle’s alarm was poorly programmed and untrustworthy as evidence.  The jury acquitted Revelle. The one million dollar insurance policy was paid to Revelle’s children."

US AML Regulations,"US Department of Treasury Targets Crypto Exchange for Facilitating Ransomware, Laundering",Crowdfund Insider | Global,Crowdfund Insider,"US Department of Treasury Targets Crypto Exchange for Facilitating Ransomware, Laundering  Ransomware attacks have become quite prevalent with nefarious actors targeting domestic firms, frequently demanding ransom in crypto. Today, the US Department of Treasury has announced a group of actions designed to mitigate ransomware activity including designating crypto exchange SUEX OTC as a “complicit financial service” for its participation in transacting illicit proceeds. This action is the first sanctions designation against a virtual currency exchange and was executed with assistance from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen stated:  “Ransomware and cyber-attacks are victimizing businesses large and small across America and are a direct threat to our economy. We will continue to crack down on malicious actors. As cybercriminals use increasingly sophisticated methods and technology, we are committed to using the full range of measures, to include sanctions and regulatory tools, to disrupt, deter, and prevent ransomware attacks.”  Treasury stated that ransomware attacks are increasing in scale, sophistication, and frequency. In 2020, it reports that ransomware payments reached over $400 million, more than four times their level in 2019.  The U.S. government estimates that these payments represent just a fraction of the economic harm caused by cyber-attacks. Treasury added that certain virtual currency exchanges are a “critical element of this ecosystem, as virtual currency is the principal means of facilitating ransomware payments and associated money laundering activities.”  Under the direction of the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), the agency has designated of SUEX OTC, S.R.O. (SUEX), a virtual currency exchange, for its part in facilitating financial transactions for ransomware actors.  According to Treasury, SUEX has facilitated transactions involving illicit proceeds from at least eight ransomware variants and known SUEX transactions indicate that over 40% of SUEX’s known transaction history is associated with illicit actors.  SUEX is being designated pursuant to Executive Order 13694, as amended, for providing material support to the threat posed by criminal ransomware actors.  Treasury said it will continue to disrupt and hold accountable these entities to reduce the incentive for cybercriminals to continue to conduct these attacks.

III.    On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission  finds that:      2   Summary    1.  These proceedings arise out of a violation  of Rule 105 of Regulation  M of the   Exchange Act by Helikon,  a London-based exempt reporting adviser.  In December 2020, Helikon   sold short American depositary shares (“ADSs” or “shares”) and then, within  the rule’s five-day   restricted period,  purchased ADSs of the same issuer in an offering,  thereby violating  Rule 105.   Helikon’s  fund profited by $669,002  from the transaction.    Respondent    2.    Helikon   is a private limited  company organized under the laws of the United   Kingdom  with its principal  place of business in London.  It has been registered with the Financial   Conduct Authority since February 2020 and has been an exempt reporting  adviser with the   Commission  since March 2020. Helikon  manages a long/short  equity fund named Helikon  Long   Short Equity Fund Master ICAV. Helikon has approximately  $1 billion  in assets under   management.   Rule 105    3.  Rule 105 makes it unlawful  for a person to purchase equity securities from an   underwriter,  broker, or dealer participating  in a public  offering if that person sold short the   security  that is the subject of the offering  during  the restricted period defined in the rule, absent   an exception.  17 C.F.R. § 242.105; see Short Selling  in Connection  with a Public Offering,  Rel.

The Rule 105   restricted period is the  shorter of the period:  (1) beginning  five business days before the pricing   of the offered securities and  ending with such pricing;  or (2) beginning  with the initial  filing  of   a registration  statement or  notification  on Exchange Act Form 1-A or Form 1-E and ending with   pricing.   4.  The Commission  adopted Rule 105 “to foster secondary and follow-on  offering   prices that are determined by independent  market dynamics and not by potentially  manipulative   activity.”  Id. Rule 105 is prophylactic  and prohibits  the conduct irrespective of the short seller’s   intent in effecting the short sale. Id.   Facts   5.  On June 9, 2020,  NIO, Inc. (“NIO”) filed  a Form F-3 shelf registration  statement   and a prospectus supplement  for an offering  of 60 million  ADSs (the “Offering”).    6.  On December 11,  2020,  Helikon  sold short 83,500  NIO ADSs in three   transactions at an average price of $42.7477.     7.  On December 14, 2020,  the Offering priced at $39.00 per share. On the same date,   Helikon  purchased 325,000  NIO ADSs in the Offering. Helikon’s  total gain from these     3   transactions was $669,002.   Helikon  did not qualify  for an exception to Rule 105 when it   purchased shares in the Offering.     8.  As a result of the conduct described above, Helikon  violated  Rule 105 of   Regulation  M under the Exchange Act.   Disgorgement and Civil Penalties   9.  The disgorgement  and prejudgment  interest ordered in paragraph IV.B. is   consistent  with equitable  principles,  does not exceed Respondent’s net profits from its violations,   and returning  the money  to Respondent  would  be inconsistent  with  equitable  principles.   Therefore, in these circumstances, distributing  disgorged  funds to the U.S. Treasury is the most   equitable  alternative.   The disgorgement  and prejudgment  interest ordered in  paragraph IV.B.   shall  be transferred to the general fund of the U.S. Treasury, subject to Section 21F(g)(3)  of the   Exchange Act.    Helikon’s Remedial Efforts   10.  In determining  to accept the Offer, the Commission  considered remedial  acts   undertaken by Respondent  upon discovering  the violation  and cooperation  afforded the   Commission  staff. In particular,  Helikon  promptly  self-reported the violation  and simultaneously   directed its fund administrator  to segregate the profits  from the violative  trading.   IV.      In view of the foregoing,  the Commission  deems it appropriate to impose  the sanctions   agreed to in Respondent Helikon’s  Offer.     Accordingly,  it is hereby ORDERED that:     A.  Pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, Respondent Helikon  cease and desist   from committing  or causing any violations  and any future violations  of Rule 105 of Regulation M of   the Exchange Act.     B.  Respondent Helikon  shall,  within  ten (10) days of the entry of this Order, pay   disgorgement  of $669,002.00,  prejudgment  interest of $11,719.59,  and a civil  money penalty of   $97,523.00  to the Securities and Exchange Commission  for transfer to the general fund of the   United States Treasury, subject to Exchange Act Section 21F(g)(3).  If timely  payment of   disgorgement  and prejudgment  interest is not made, additional  interest shall accrue pursuant to   SEC Rule of Practice 600. If timely  payment of the civil  money penalty is not made, additional   interest shall accrue pursuant to 31 U.S.C. § 3717.   Payment must be made in one of the following  ways:     (1)  Respondent may transmit payment electronically  to the Commission,  which   will  provide  detailed ACH transfer/Fedwire instructions  upon request;      4   (2)  Respondent may make direct payment from a bank account via Pay.gov   through the SEC website at http://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ofm.htm;  or    (3)  Respondent may pay by certified check, bank cashier’s check, or United   States postal money order, made payable to the Securities and Exchange   Commission  and hand-delivered  or mailed  to:    Enterprise Services Center   Accounts Receivable Branch   HQ Bldg.,  Room 181,  AMZ-341   6500 South MacArthur Boulevard   Oklahoma City,  OK 73169   Payments by check or money order must be accompanied by a cover letter identifying   Helikon  Investments Ltd. as a Respondent in these proceedings, and the file  number of these   proceedings; a copy of the cover letter and check or money order must be sent to Sanjay Wadhwa,   Senior Associate Regional  Director, Division  of Enforcement, Securities and Exchange   Commission,  200 Vesey Street, 4  th    Floor,  New York, NY 10281-1022.        D.  Amounts ordered to be paid as civil  money penalties pursuant to this Order shall be   treated as penalties paid to the government for all purposes, including  all tax purposes.  To   preserve the deterrent effect of the civil  penalty, Respondent agrees that in any Related Investor   Action, it shall not argue that it is entitled to, nor shall  it benefit by, offset or reduction of any   award of compensatory damages by the amount of any part of Respondent’s payment of a civil   penalty in this action (“Penalty Offset”).  If the court in any Related Investor Action grants such a   Penalty Offset, Respondent agrees that it shall,  within  30 days after entry of a final order granting     the Penalty Offset, notify  the Commission's  counsel in this action and pay the amount of the   Penalty Offset to the Securities and Exchange Commission.   Such a payment shall not be deemed   an additional  civil  penalty and shall  not be deemed to change the amount of the civil  penalty   imposed  in this proceeding.  For purposes of this paragraph, a “Related Investor Action” means a   private damages action brought  against Respondent by or on behalf of one or more investors based   on substantially  the same facts as alleged in the Order instituted  by the Commission  in this   proceeding.

False Claims Act,DC Circuit Revives Medicare Advantage Overpayment Rule,JD Supra | Health Updates,JD Supra,"DC Circuit Revives Medicare Advantage Overpayment Rule  On August 13, the D.C. Circuit revived the CMS 2014 Medicare Advantage Overpayment Rule in deciding UnitedHealthcare Ins. Co. v. Becerra, a ruling that could have broad implications for Medicare Advantage (MA) insurers. See UnitedHealthcare Ins. Co. v. Becerra, No. 18-5326, 2021 WL 3573766 (D.C. Cir. Aug. 13, 2021).  The Affordable Care Act requires MA insurers to report and return any overpayments identified by the insurer to CMS within 60 days. Failure to do so can trigger liability under the False Claims Act. In 2014, CMS promulgated the Overpayment Rule to implement these statutory requirements and further specified that a ""diagnosis that has been submitted [by a Medicare Advantage insurer] for payment but is found to be invalid because it does not have supporting medical record documentation would result in an overpayment."" Becerra, 2021 WL 3573766, at *10. For purposes of the rule, overpayments are ""identified"" when actually identified or when they should have been identified by the insurer ""through the exercise of reasonable diligence."" ""Reasonable diligence"" is defined as ""proactive compliance activities conducted in good faith by qualified individuals to monitor for the receipt of overpayments."" 42 C.F.R. § 422.326 at 29,921.  Documentation of a reported medical diagnosis is relevant here because of the way CMS pays MA insurers. Unlike traditional fee-for-service (FFS) Medicare payments, MA insurers receive pre-established monthly lump sum payments for each beneficiary they insure. The monthly payment amounts are intended to reflect the relative risk and cost of insuring any particular member. To that end, the Medicare statute requires a monthly payment adjustment to reflect ""such risk factors as age, disability status, gender, institutional status, and … health status … , so as to ensure actuarial equivalence"" between traditional Medicare and Medicare Advantage. MA insurers are then paid larger amounts for covering higher risk, costlier individuals. 42 U.S.C. § 1395w-23(a)(1)(C)(i).  CMS uses the Hierarchical Condition Category risk adjustment model to convert diagnosis data into expected costs for MA beneficiaries. The model uses data from individuals covered under the traditional Medicare program to determine medical costs associated with certain diagnosis and demographic information. CMS then uses this data to predict the cost of care for MA beneficiaries based on their demographics and diagnoses.  Since errors may occur in reporting diagnosis codes, CMS has implemented mechanisms, including the Overpayment Rule, to validate reported diagnoses. Another validation mechanism is the Risk Adjustment Data Validation audit through which CMS audits a sample of medical records for any unsupported diagnoses that may have resulted in an overpayment. CMS then extrapolates this sample's error rate across all beneficiaries. At one point, CMS considered adding, but ultimately did not, an FFS adjuster to achieve actuarial equivalence in the RADV program. The FFS adjuster would be applied to any overpayment amounts to ensure that MA insurers were only liable for repayments that exceeded any payment errors under the traditional Medicare program. The FFS adjuster was at issue in the challenge to the Overpayment Rule before the D.C. Circuit.  DC District Court Vacates Overpayment Rule in 2018  A group of MA insurers sued to challenge the Overpayment Rule in 2016. The MA insurers argued, among other things, that the Overpayment Rule: (1) ran afoul of the Medicare statute's actuarial equivalence requirement; (2) is inconsistent with CMS' earlier announcement that an FFS adjuster would be applied to RADV audits; and (3) applies a negligence standard to False Claims Act liability, which contradicts the FCA's standards.  The District Court granted the insurers' motion for summary judgment and vacated the Overpayment Rule, holding that it violated the Medicare statute's actuarial equivalence requirement. The court held that because ""payments for care under traditional Medicare and Medicare Advantage are both set annually based on costs from unaudited traditional Medicare records,"" but the Overpayment Rule measures overpayments on audited records, there was an actuarial distinction. Becerra, 2021 WL 3573766, at *10. The court found there could be no actuarial equivalence between payments under traditional Medicare and Medicare Advantage when CMS pays for ""all diagnostic codes, erroneous or not, submitted to traditional Medicare,"" but would require repayment for erroneous diagnoses submitted by MA insurers. UnitedHealthcare Ins. Co. v. Azar, 330 F. Supp. 3d 173, 187 (D.D.C. 2018).  The court further held that CMS' prior statements regarding the inclusion of an FFS adjuster in its RADV audits for purposes of actuarial equivalence constituted an agency decision or policy from which CMS unlawfully departed in enacting the Overpayment Rule. Id. at 189-90.  Finally, the court held that the Overpayment Rule's ""reasonable diligence"" requirement went ""far beyond the False Claims Act,"" and ""CMS has no legislative authority to apply more stringent standards to impose FCA consequences through regulation."" Id. at 191.  DC Circuit Court Revives Overpayment Rule  CMS appealed the District Court's order in late 2018 and prevailed in August. In reversing the District Court's order, the Circuit Court primarily focused on whether the Medicare statute's actuarial equivalence requirement even applied to the Overpayment Rule. The court answered that question in the negative: ""[A]ctuarial equivalence does not apply to the Overpayment Rule or the statutory overpayment-refund obligation under which it was promulgated. Reference to actuarial equivalence appears in a different statutory subchapter … and neither provision cross-references the other."" Becerra, 2021 WL 3573766, at *2. It further explained that ""[a]ctuarial equivalence is a directive to CMS. It describes the goal of the risk-adjustment model Congress directed CMS to develop. It does not separately apply to the requirement that Medicare Advantage insurers avoid known error in their payment requests."" Id.  Because the court held that the actuarial equivalence requirement does not even apply to the Overpayment Rule, it ruled that the agency had no obligation to consider an FFS adjuster as it did in the context of RADV audits.  Notably, CMS did not appeal the District Court's holding on the Overpayment Rule's reasonable diligence requirement as it pertains to False Claims Act liability. Accordingly, the District Court's holding that the reasonable diligence requirement was overreaching remains intact. Although the Circuit Court was not charged with reviewing the reasonable diligence requirement, it did, in the context of evaluating the actuarial equivalence requirement, reject the insurers' argument that the Overpayment Rule ""creates a sweeping obligation that effectively requires Medicare Advantage insurers to self-audit all their data."" Id. at *13. The court explained that ""nothing in the Overpayment Rule obligates insurers to audit their reported data … the Rule only requires"" refunds for any known overpayments, i.e., ""payments [insurers] are aware lack support in a beneficiary's medical records.""  Implications  With this opinion, the D.C. Circuit disfavored arguments advanced by Medicare Advantage insurers and the District Court, largely reinstating the Overpayment Rule and shoring up CMS' authority to implement fraud prevention and cost containment measures in a variety of forms. Importantly though, this opinion did not disturb the significant victory Medicare Advantage insurers enjoyed at the District Court concerning the reasonable diligence requirement, which the court ruled could not be applied to lower the standard for False Claims Act Liability. Even so, Medicare Advantage insurers must remain diligent in their compliance procedures. As the Circuit Court made clear, CMS has several tools in its arsenal — including certification obligations, RADV audits, and the Overpayment Rule — to identify and recoup overpayments and to potentially impose substantial liability for erroneous coding submissions."

III.    On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission  finds that:      2   Summary    1.  These proceedings arise out of a violation  of Rule 105 of Regulation  M of the   Exchange Act by Helikon,  a London-based exempt reporting adviser.  In December 2020, Helikon   sold short American depositary shares (“ADSs” or “shares”) and then, within  the rule’s five-day   restricted period,  purchased ADSs of the same issuer in an offering,  thereby violating  Rule 105.

The disgorgement  and prejudgment  interest ordered in paragraph IV.B. is   consistent  with equitable  principles,  does not exceed Respondent’s net profits from its violations,   and returning  the money  to Respondent  would  be inconsistent  with  equitable  principles.   Therefore, in these circumstances, distributing  disgorged  funds to the U.S. Treasury is the most   equitable  alternative.   The disgorgement  and prejudgment  interest ordered in  paragraph IV.B.   shall  be transferred to the general fund of the U.S. Treasury, subject to Section 21F(g)(3)  of the   Exchange Act.    Helikon’s Remedial Efforts   10.  In determining  to accept the Offer, the Commission  considered remedial  acts   undertaken by Respondent  upon discovering  the violation  and cooperation  afforded the   Commission  staff. In particular,  Helikon  promptly  self-reported the violation  and simultaneously   directed its fund administrator  to segregate the profits  from the violative  trading.   IV.      In view of the foregoing,  the Commission  deems it appropriate to impose  the sanctions   agreed to in Respondent Helikon’s  Offer.     Accordingly,  it is hereby ORDERED that:     A.  Pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, Respondent Helikon  cease and desist   from committing  or causing any violations  and any future violations  of Rule 105 of Regulation M of   the Exchange Act.     B.  Respondent Helikon  shall,  within  ten (10) days of the entry of this Order, pay   disgorgement  of $669,002.00,  prejudgment  interest of $11,719.59,  and a civil  money penalty of   $97,523.00  to the Securities and Exchange Commission  for transfer to the general fund of the   United States Treasury, subject to Exchange Act Section 21F(g)(3).  If timely  payment of   disgorgement  and prejudgment  interest is not made, additional  interest shall accrue pursuant to   SEC Rule of Practice 600. If timely  payment of the civil  money penalty is not made, additional   interest shall accrue pursuant to 31 U.S.C. § 3717.   Payment must be made in one of the following  ways:     (1)  Respondent may transmit payment electronically  to the Commission,  which   will  provide  detailed ACH transfer/Fedwire instructions  upon request;      4   (2)  Respondent may make direct payment from a bank account via Pay.gov   through the SEC website at http://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ofm.htm;  or    (3)  Respondent may pay by certified check, bank cashier’s check, or United   States postal money order, made payable to the Securities and Exchange   Commission  and hand-delivered  or mailed  to:    Enterprise Services Center   Accounts Receivable Branch   HQ Bldg.,  Room 181,  AMZ-341   6500 South MacArthur Boulevard   Oklahoma City,  OK 73169   Payments by check or money order must be accompanied by a cover letter identifying   Helikon  Investments Ltd. as a Respondent in these proceedings, and the file  number of these   proceedings; a copy of the cover letter and check or money order must be sent to Sanjay Wadhwa,   Senior Associate Regional  Director, Division  of Enforcement, Securities and Exchange   Commission,  200 Vesey Street, 4  th    Floor,  New York, NY 10281-1022.        D.  Amounts ordered to be paid as civil  money penalties pursuant to this Order shall be   treated as penalties paid to the government for all purposes, including  all tax purposes.  To   preserve the deterrent effect of the civil  penalty, Respondent agrees that in any Related Investor   Action, it shall not argue that it is entitled to, nor shall  it benefit by, offset or reduction of any   award of compensatory damages by the amount of any part of Respondent’s payment of a civil   penalty in this action (“Penalty Offset”).  If the court in any Related Investor Action grants such a   Penalty Offset, Respondent agrees that it shall,  within  30 days after entry of a final order granting     the Penalty Offset, notify  the Commission's  counsel in this action and pay the amount of the   Penalty Offset to the Securities and Exchange Commission.   Such a payment shall not be deemed   an additional  civil  penalty and shall  not be deemed to change the amount of the civil  penalty   imposed  in this proceeding.  For purposes of this paragraph, a “Related Investor Action” means a   private damages action brought  against Respondent by or on behalf of one or more investors based   on substantially  the same facts as alleged in the Order instituted  by the Commission  in this   proceeding.     By the Commission.   Vanessa A. Countryman                  Secretary   "

Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) Circulars/Guidelines  The SFC published a Circular on 19 July 2021 regarding further updates to the Exemption Scheme. The further updates are made in light of the adjustments to the quarantine requirements for vaccinated persons arriving in Hong Kong announced by the HKSAR Government. The key updates include shortening the period of itinerary and point-to-point transportation requirements for inbound travellers (who have stayed in high or medium risk places specified in Group B or Group C under Cap. 599H or Taiwan, China during the 14 days prior to their arrival in Hong Kong and who possess a positive result of a recognised serology antibody test) to the first seven days instead of the entire 14-day medical surveillance period. The Department of Health and Food and Health Bureau has also updated their ""Guidelines for vehicles providing point-to-point transportation arrangements for exempted persons (air crew, sea crew and others)"".  Accordingly, the SFC has adjusted their requirements for the submission of attestation forms under the Exemption Scheme. Sponsored licensed corporations should submit a signed attestation form:  a. for a returning executive, on his or her third and seventh days in Hong Kong;  b. for a visiting executive,  i. on the last day of his or her trip if he or she stays in Hong Kong for less than three days; or  ii. on his or her third day in Hong Kong, and on the seventh day in Hong Kong or the last day of his or her trip, whichever is earlier, if he or she stays in Hong Kong for more than three days.  Please refer to Appendix II to the Circular for the updated attestation form.  The antibody testing and COVID-19 testing (post-arrival test) requirements of the Exemption Scheme are also updated as follows:  a. the list of recognised laboratories and criteria have been updated to align with the Government's announcements;  b. the specification that specimens must be collected for an antibody test on the day of arrival or the following day has been removed; and  c. the post-arrival test on the seventh day will be advanced to the fifth day in Hong Kong.  Please refer to Appendix I to the Circular for the revisions to the exemption conditions and requirements.  The Circular should be read in conjunction with the SFC's earlier Circular on Exemption for senior executives of licensed corporations issued on 28 May 2021 (Exemption Scheme) and Updates to the Exemption Scheme issued on 21 June 2021.

Circular to licensed corporations – Business continuity planning in view of COVID-19 Vaccination Programme   The SFC published a Circular identifying vaccination as key element of operational risk management and strongly encouraging licensed corporations to consider vaccination as a critical part of operational risk management to ensure their business operations and client interests are not unduly affected by COVID-19. The SFC urges licensed corporations to:  (a) review their business continuity plan (BCP) and identify functions which are critical to their business operations and client interests and encourage staff performing such critical functions, for example client-facing and critical support staff, to get vaccinated. Licensed corporations are also reminded to maintain proper documentation of any changes to their BCPs; and  (b) consider suitable arrangements for critical staff who have not yet been vaccinated or are unfit for vaccination due to medical conditions to undergo periodic COVID-19 testing.  The goal is to keep driving down infection rates, interrupt community transmission and uplift COVID-related restrictions in order to return to a high level of normalcy.   The SFC published a Circular informing licensed corporations that the Government has designated certain categories of persons in the financial services sector to be exempted from the compulsory quarantine arrangements in Hong Kong under Cap. 599C and Cap. 599E (""Exemption Scheme""). Senior executives of licensed corporations or their overseas affiliates who are fully vaccinated and meet the eligibility criteria may apply for exemption from the compulsory quarantine arrangements when they return or travel to Hong Kong.  In short, this is not an automatic exemption. Applications must be made in advance and there are limited quotas. The SFC has sole discretion whether to approve or refuse an application.  Who are eligible to apply for exemption  1. senior executives travelling from and returning to Hong Kong, namely, senior executives of a licensed corporation with global or regional roles who are returning to Hong Kong after travelling to foreign places primarily for the purposes of managing the group entities for which they have responsibility (""returning executives""); and  2. senior executives visiting Hong Kong, namely, global or regional heads or senior executives of financial institutions that a licensed corporation is affiliated with, who are travelling to Hong Kong primarily for the purposes of managing the licensed corporation (""visiting executives"").  Limited quota  3. The quotas are limited to two entries for returning executives and two entries for visiting executives, respectively, per calendar month per licensed corporation.  Application procedures  4. Applications for exemption should be made by the sponsoring licensed corporation of the returning executives or the visiting executives, by completing the prescribed application form (see Appendix I to the Circular) and providing the requisite supporting documents set out in the Circular, including an itinerary of the proposed exempted executive for the entire duration of the trip (for a visiting executive) or throughout the entire medical surveillance period (for a returning executive) in Hong Kong, with information about his or her arrival, departure, accommodation or designated quarantine hotel, organisations and venues to be visited with the dates and times of the visits. Please also follow the application procedures set out in the Circular.  Requirements on exempted executives and their sponsoring licensed corporations  5. Each exempted executive is required to fully comply with the specific conditions for exemptions set out in the authorisation letter issued by the FSTB and is only allowed to leave his or her designated quarantine hotel or accommodation arranged by the sponsoring licensed corporation for approved activities set out in the itinerary. A set of sample conditions is set out in the Notes appended to the application form for reference. These conditions include the completion of a COVID-19 vaccination course; pre-departure, on arrival and post-arrival COVID-19 tests; point-to-point transportation; self-isolation and medical surveillance.  6.Each sponsoring licensed corporation is required to:  (a) keep an up-to-date record of the itinerary of each exempted executive for the entire duration of the trip (for a visiting executive) or throughout the entire medical surveillance period (for a returning executive) in Hong Kong. The itinerary maintained by the sponsoring licensed corporation should also include information about the contact details of the persons who had met or would meet with the exempted executive in Hong Kong. Any changes to the itinerary should be submitted to the SFC upon arrival in Hong Kong and at the time when the sponsoring licensed corporation submits the attestation form as required under item(d) below;  (b) ensure compliance with the guidelines for vehicles providing point-to-point transportation (see Appendix III to the Circular);  (c) ensure that, for exempted persons in self-isolation at an accommodation arranged by the sponsoring licensed corporation, the Department of Health's infection control guidelines are adhered to;  (d) submit to the SFC an attestation form (in the form prescribed in Appendix II to the Circular) signed by a responsible officer or the manager-in-charge of compliance function of the sponsoring licensed corporation, every three working days or at the half-way point of the trip, whichever is earlier, and on the last day of the trip (for a visiting executive) or the medical surveillance period (for a returning executive); and  (e) report to the SFC as soon as possible if an exempted executive is confirmed or suspected to be infected with COVID-19 during his or her trip in Hong Kong and within 14 days after departing Hong Kong (for a visiting executive) or during the medical surveillance period (for a returning executive).  Consequence of violation  Any contravention with the exemption conditions would result in removal of the exemption status. In addition, if an exempted person who is subject to self-isolation in a designated quarantine hotel room is found to have breached the self-isolation requirement, the concerned exempted person's exemption status will be removed immediately and he / she will be sent to the HKSAR Government's Quarantine Centre for compulsory quarantine for 21 days. An exempted person who fails to observe any of the conditions commits an offence and, on conviction, will be liable to a fine of HK$5,000 and to imprisonment for 6 months.  The sponsoring licensed corporations are responsible for ensuring the accuracy and authenticity of the information submitted as part of the Exemption Scheme, and such responsibility ultimately rests with the senior management of each sponsoring licensed corporation.

Appendix III – Guideline for vehicles providing point-to-point transportation can be found here.  The SFC published a circular informing licensed corporations (LCs) that the SFC will defer the introduction of initial margin (IM) requirements for non-centrally cleared over-the-counter (OTC) derivative transactions by one year to provide operational relief in light of the COVID-19 outbreak.

Americans with Disabilities Act,"Vaccine Inquisitions? As COVID Vaccination Mandates Increase, Religious Exemptions Come Under Fire",The Daily Caller | News,The Daily Caller,"Vaccine Inquisitions? As COVID Vaccination Mandates Increase, Religious Exemptions Come Under Fire  Religious inquisitions loom  Thousands of Americans are seeking religious exemptions to vaccine mandates.  Under the Americans with Disabilities Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, U.S. employers are required to accommodate their employee’s “sincerely held” religious beliefs — including potential religious objections to a vaccine.  “Public institutions should not act like inquisitorial boards, quizzing people’s religious beliefs and trying to find holes because somebody has a different view of things,” said Roger Severino, former director of the Office of Civil Rights. “If separation of church and state means anything, it means that state institutions don’t second guess to try to resolve religious truths.”  Columbia University’s Robert Klitzman shared a tragic story with CNN Saturday of a woman riddled with cancer who reportedly refused to undergo medical procedures, relied on the power of prayer, and ultimately died.  “Her religious belief contributed to her death, unfortunately,” he said.  Klitzman, who directs Columbia’s bioethics masters program, stressed that employees should not be able to easily obtain religious exemptions from President Joe Biden’s vaccine mandates, pointing to the extreme beliefs of jihadists and noting, “there are limits in our society to how far religious beliefs can go.”  He also suggested that the Biden administration should create “guidelines” to decide whether Americans’ religious objections measure up. (RELATED: POLL: 48% Of Americans Say Biden’s Vaccine Mandates Go Too Far)  “The problem is a lot of religious exemptions that people are claiming…are based on myths,” he said. “People saying, for instance, ‘all vaccines are made using fetal cells, and I’m pro-life.’ That’s simply not true.”  A Biden administration official told the Daily Caller News Foundation Tuesday afternoon that protecting religious Americans “will be part of the policy process,” but did not further explain the remark. From the briefing room, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki confirmed that some individuals may receive religious exemptions from the Biden mandate.  But pressure from activists and mandate-minded lawmakers suggests that the religious objections of Americans may face more serious inquisition in the coming weeks.  “How much can we ask? How far can we push? Do we have to accommodate this? Those are the questions employers are trying to figure out,” Society for Human Resource Management adviser Barbara Holland told the New York Times. “How do I tease out who’s not telling the truth?”  Democratic New York Gov. Kathy Hochul told reporters in early September that she was unaware “of a sanctioned religious exemption from any organized religion,” dismissing the idea that healthcare workers could be religiously exempt from the state’s vaccine mandate. (RELATED: Pope Francis Orders COVID Passport For Vatican Visitors)  “To the extent that there’s leadership of different religious organizations that have spoken, and they have, I’m not aware of a sanctioned religious exemption from any organized religion,” Hochul said. “In fact, they’re encouraging the opposite. They’re encouraging their members, everybody from the Pope on down, is encouraging people to get vaccinated. So people will say what they choose.”  But neither the governor of New York nor or any employer has the authority to tell an individual what he or she believes, Ethics and Public Policy Center senior fellow Roger Severino told the Daily Caller News Foundation.  Should an employer rebut the religious objection of a Catholic employee by noting that the pope had encouraged Catholics to get vaccinated, Severino told the DCNF, that would amount to religious discrimination.  “For employers to say, ‘you are wrong’ about your own beliefs is a) arrogant and b) discriminatory because people are entitled to their own religious beliefs,” Severino said. “Even if they disagree with their own religious leaders.”  Many thousands of Americans are seeking religious exemptions to vaccine mandates, citing reports that some of the vaccines were developed using aborted fetal cell lines. Objectors also cite concerns over the haste with which the vaccines were made, anxieties over the vaccines’ effects on fertility, and distaste for the authoritarian government mandates.  Under the Americans with Disabilities Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, U.S. employers are required to accommodate their employee’s “sincerely held” religious beliefs — including potential religious objections to a vaccine.  “Public institutions should not act like inquisitorial boards, quizzing people’s religious beliefs and trying to find holes because somebody has a different view of things,” said Severino, who is the former director of the Office of Civil Rights at the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). “If separation of church and state means anything, it means that state institutions don’t second guess to try to resolve religious truths.”  Workplace Religious Accommodations: What Are They?  There is longstanding legal precedent for workplace religious accommodations to be taken as sincere, Religious Freedom & Business Foundation President Brian Grim told the DCNF.  “They are viewed as personal religious convictions rather than ecclesiastical, in other words, matters of conscience rather than doctrine per se, given that there is wide variety in how people put to practice their faiths,” Grim said. “The question then becomes whether the accommodation request puts an undue burden on the employer, who is also protected by law and responsible for the health and well-being of all employees.”  U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) guidance warns that “whether or not a religious belief is sincerely held by an applicant or employee is rarely at issue in many types of Title VII religious claims.  “For example,” the guidance said, “with respect to an allegation of discriminatory discharge or harassment, it is the motivation of the discriminating official, not the actual beliefs of the individual alleging discrimination, that is relevant in determining if the discrimination that occurred was because of religion.”  Neither the commission nor the courts should “be in the business of deciding whether a person holds religious beliefs for the ‘proper’ reasons,” the guidance said, but they may examine whether the individual’s motives or reasons for holding the belief. (RELATED: Archdiocese Of Philadelphia Orders Priests Not To Give Catholics Vaccine Exemptions)  An individual would not be deemed insincere in his belief just because he is not scrupulous in his observance, the guidance notes, but an employee’s credibility could be undermined by behaving “in a manner markedly inconsistent with the professed belief,” if the accommodation the individual is seeking would have a “particularly desirable benefit that is likely to be sought for secular reasons,” if the timing of the religious objection is suspect, or the employer has other reasons to believe the “accommodation is not sought for religious reasons.”  None of these factors are final, however: an individual may inconsistently practice his faith but still hold sincerely held beliefs, or an individual may have “Forgone his or her sincerely held religious practice” out of fear of discrimination, according to the EEOC guidance.  How Far Can The Biden Administration Go?  Legal experts at the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) are evaluating what the Biden administration mandates mean for religious employers and churches. (RELATED: Vatican Declares Coronavirus Vaccines ‘Morally Acceptable’)  “Should these mandates encroach on the First Amendment freedoms and autonomy of religious institutions, ADF stands ready to challenge the administration in federal court,” ADF President and CEO Michael Farris and General Counsel Kristen Waggoner said in a statement.  Some have already taken the mandates to court.  In early September, a group of 17 health professionals represented by the Thomas More Society sued New York and Hochul, accusing the state of violating Title VII and Constitutional rights through its vaccination mandate and by disavowing religious exemptions.  The United States District Court for the Northern District of New York granted a temporary restraining order to the medical workers Sept. 14, barring the New York Department of Health “from interfering in any way with the granting of religious exemptions from COVID-19 vaccination going forward.”  New York Medical Workers Su… by Mary Margaret Olohan  Hochul, who did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the DCNF, has until Sept. 22 to respond in court.  “What New York is attempting to do is slam shut an escape hatch from an unconstitutional vaccine mandate,” Thomas More Society Special Counsel attorney Christopher Ferrara said in a Sept. 14 statement. “And they are doing this while knowing that many people have sincere religious objections to vaccines that were tested, developed, or produced with cell lines derived from aborted children.”  Vaccines And Abortion-Derived Cell Lines  Analysis by the Charlotte Lozier Institute (CLI) released in December 2020 found that the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson use abortion-derived cell lines in development, production, and lab testing.  Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, Novavax, and Inovio use abortion-derived cells in some tests but do not use abortion-derived cells in other tests, the analysis found, but these four do not use abortion-derived cell lines in development or production of the vaccine.  CLI Vice President Dr. David Prentice previously told the DCNF that when abortion-derived cell lines are used in the production of a vaccine, that means the cells are “directly involved in making the final product, the vaccine that is injected in our arms.” (RELATED: Here’s Which COVID Vaccines Are Produced, Tested Using Aborted Baby Cells, According To A Pro-Life Institute)  “It is an essential element for the final vaccine,” Prentice said. “Although the connection is distant both in time and space, since the abortion occurred decades ago and the cells have been grown in the lab ever since, that connection to abortion remains and is of concern to many Americans. ”  Laboratory testing using abortion-derived cell lines is potentially less morally problematic, since it is “anther step removed” Prentice said.  “When an abortion-derived cell line is used in laboratory testing, that is not done within the production line,” he explained. “It’s a confirmatory test done on the final vaccine, to validate what the scientists believe they’ve produced.”  Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

European Systemic Risk Board,Avoiding a financial epidemic – The role of macroprudential policies,MarketScreener.com | Companies,MarketScreener,"Avoiding a financial epidemic – The role of macroprudential policies  Beyond financial stability - macroprudential policies and economic growth  Surprisingly, the overwhelming majority of papers in the literature concentrate on the effects of macroprudential policies on financial stability. Only a few measure the effect on the ultimate target, economic growth. In Ampudia et al. (2021), we review the literature, following the meta-analysis of Araujo et al. (2020). Our conclusion is that papers including GDP growth in their analysis find statistically significant negative effects of macroprudential tightening measures on economic activity. This effect is so obvious that it has been termed the ""cost of macroprudential policies"" (Richter et al., 2018).  Another strand of the literature - Jorda et al. (2013) and Claessens et al. (2011), among many others - concentrates on how recessions associated with financial imbalances, particularly credit booms, tend to be deeper with more sluggish recoveries. These empirical facts have clearly shaped the role of macroprudential policies: according to the above findings, preventing financial distress should result in milder recessions. This is key to obtaining higher average long-term economic growth to compensate for the short-term negative impact mentioned above.  Our work combines these different views on the effect of macroprudential polices on GDP growth, by analysing and measuring the benefits and costs of its implementation. We do so using a range of state of the art models and analytical tools. We assess how a variety of macroprudential policy instruments affect the stability of euro area banks, households and aggregate credit. The results demonstrate how novel models are able to balance the short-term costs of macroprudential measures, namely lower aggregate credit growth, with their long-term benefits. We proceed in two steps. First, we show how macroprudential policies affect financial stability and second, we show how financial stability affects economic growth.  Step 1. Macroprudential policies and financial stability  We start by providing theoretical evidence that capital measures decrease bank default risk and thereby smooth credit supply. We show these facts by:  - changing the capital ratio of the three-layers-of-default model of Clerc et al. (2015);  - computing the probability of bank default and the evolution of total credit in response to an adverse financial shock.  The model highlights how frictions in the financial sector affect the credit market for investment goods, housing capital and deposits, amplifying the transmission of exogenous shocks to the economy. In the model, households and firms borrow from banks to finance house purchases and capital investment, respectively. The macroprudential authority sets capital requirements so that banks have to retain equity in proportion to the amount of loans issued. In Ampudia et al. (2021) we introduce LTV limits that constrain the credit take-up for housing.  Simulation results show that, in the long run, tighter capital regulation makes banks more resilient, by reducing banks' leverage and making them less likely to default. LTV limits reduce the exposure of GDP and credit growth to housing-related shocks. They also increase exposure to firms, as lending to firms increases. Our dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model concludes that both capital requirements and LTV limits are effective in smoothing out the credit cycle and shielding the economy: not only does credit decrease when requirements are tightened, but the impact of adverse shocks is also contained.  In addition, our study provides empirical evidence of these findings. Existing empirical studies are mostly based on cross-country panel regressions. They largely neglect the effect of macroprudential policy on GDP and inflation, as well as potential second-round effects of these variables on future values of credit. The narrative panel vector autoregressive approach, based on Budnik and Rünstler (2021), addresses these shortcomings. It provides deeper insights into the dynamics of the transition to the new steady state following macroprudential policy interventions. We study a sample covering 11 euro area countries (the initial adopters, excluding Luxembourg, and Greece) and focus on three categories of instruments, namely minimum capital requirements, LTV limits and other borrower-based measures (such as DTI and DSTI limits). We find a sizeable impact of macroprudential policy measures on credit - and house prices - and a small effect on output and inflation. Additionally, on average, borrower-based measures have a higher impact than capital requirements, in line with the DSGE model simulations.  To complement the macroeconomic results, we analyse the impact of macroprudential policy on the resilience of individual agents. We use two empirical models relying on microeconomic data. To explore the relation between borrower-based instruments and borrowers' resilience, we use household-level survey data for Italy and Spain  to study the effect of LTV ratios at origination, i.e. at the start of loans, on borrowers' probability of default. We estimate a model which relates the effect of the LTV at origination for the main loan on a household's main residence to the probability of default. Does this LTV affect whether the household has been late or missed payments on its loans during the last 12 months, controlling for a series of loan and household characteristics? The results are shown in Table 1. As can be seen in the table, the probability of default increases with the level of the LTV at origination. Increasing the LTV ratio cuts out some of the riskiest loans, decreasing the average probability of default.   Next, we study the interaction of different borrower-based measures and their impact on the resilience of banks and borrowers, while accounting for macroeconomic feedback effects. We use a more complex modelling framework: the semi-structural, micro-macro integrated household balance sheet model of Gross et al. (2021). This has also been implemented, with country-specific modifications, in a related policy analysis for Slovakia (Jurča et al. 2020). The methodology integrates an empirical microeconomic module simulating the unemployment status of borrowers and a semi-structural macroeconomic module (Structural VAR) that relates dynamically the main macroeconomic magnitudes into a dynamic household balance simulator. The aim is to determine the impact on household and bank resilience of borrower-based measures, relative to a ""no-policy"" scenario.  The results suggest that borrower-based measures can significantly enhance borrower resilience and support bank solvency ratios. Income-based policies (DSTI and DTI limits) improve the resilience of borrowers and the risk profile of mortgage exposures. They do so primarily by compressing probabilities of default, reducing them by 50-60 basis points relative to a no-policy baseline scenario. Meanwhile collateral-based policies exert their impact primarily through reducing the loss-given-default, by 300 basis points relative to a no-policy baseline scenario. Borrower-based measures are also found to increase the quality of bank mortgage portfolios over time and thereby help banks improve their capital positions.  Step 2. Financial stability and economic growth  Using state-of-the-art methods, we have shown how macroprudential policies have a clear and direct positive impact on financial stability, particularly on controlling the evolution of credit. But the picture is not complete without establishing the link as shown the top panel in Chart 1: the final step is to address how financial stability ultimately affects economic growth. The rationale is simple - in order to justify macroprudential policy intervention, the financial stability benefits of macroprudential policy should exert a positive effect on long-term growth.  To explore the role of financial stability - and particularly of credit - in business cycle characteristics, the study uses the results of Gadea et al. (2020). They compare the effect of macroprudential policies on both expansions and recessions. Their study uses data from 53 countries for an unbalanced panel of quarterly data starting in 1947. They find that, in the two years prior to the onset of recessions, the variation in credit relative to GDP has a non-linear relationship to the amount of wealth loss during the recession. Adjusting a mixture of normal distributions, they show that if the variation of credit belongs to the first quartile of the distribution of the data, with an 80% probability, the recession will imply a loss in wealth of 3% of GDP, and a loss in wealth of 20% of GDP otherwise. By contrast, being in the fourth quartile implies a loss in wealth of 6% in the mild scenario, which has a probability of 58%, and a loss of 30% - a financial epidemic - in the severe one (with a 42% probability).  During expansions, the relation between credit and wealth is completely different: the duration of expansions depends on the intensity of credit growth during the expansion. Specifically, on average, without taking the level of credit into account, the expected duration of an expansion is close to 25 quarters. If credit is low, the expected duration is reduced to 18 quarters. Meanwhile if an expansion has been correctly fuelled by credit  , the expansion lasts around 35 quarters on average. Bringing these results together, the paper finds that credit growth rates in the third quartile of the distribution imply the maximum amount of wealth accumulation over the cycle. Therefore, the increase in wealth associated with higher expected GDP growth due to longer expansions more than compensates for the deeper recessions.  Conclusion  The COVID-19 pandemic has shown that, in healthcare, epidemics and pandemics are fought by focusing on populations - more than on individuals - and that the costs of restrictions in the short term can be more than offset by the long-term gains.  Our study shows that macroprudential policies, focusing on prevention to safeguard the financial system as a whole, imply a set of restrictions, and, as in the case of healthcare, the costs of restrictions in the short term can be more than offset by the long-term gains.  In our paper we provide evidence of that result in two steps. First, we find clear evidence that macroprudential measures boost financial stability. Based on both macro-level and micro-level evidence, we find that they make banks and borrowers more resilient and can curb excessive credit growth - but that's not all. Second, we find that financial stability raises long-term economic growth by making recessions shallower and, in particular, financial epidemics less likely. At the same time, if credit constraints are not too tight the right amount of credit fosters longer expansions, boosting economic growth. Therefore, in order to maximise economic growth, macroprudential policies should be well calibrated - similarly to preventive healthcare measures - to allow for longer expansions but avoid financial epidemics.

On Monday, a judge in U.S. District Court in the Northern District of California granted a motion to dismiss the claims against NVIDIA, although the plaintiffs have 30 days to amend their complaint to address its shortcomings.  The case is one of many brought recently by law firm Capozzi Adler.  The plaintiffs alleged that NVIDIA, the sponsor to the nearly $1.5 billion plan, ran afoul of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act by allegedly failing to opt for lower-cost share classes of mutual funds, failing to choose collective investment trusts, not including passively managed funds rather than active ones, selecting higher-cost funds in general and paying excessive fees to the plan’s record keeper, Fidelity.  The defendants raised several issues with the complaint — including that allegations that the plan did not include a K share class of Fidelity’s Contrafund were bogus, as the plan did include it until 2018, when it replaced the fund with a lower-cost commingled fund, according to the order.  The judge also noted that comparisons the plaintiffs made between share classes within the plan and lower-fee varieties were not ideal. The higher-cost share classes in the plan included revenue sharing, which was used to pay for administrative expenses, while the comparator funds did not.  Similarly, comparisons between the mutual funds used in the plan and CITs that were available were inappropriate as the products’ features are different, the court noted.  And while the plaintiffs cited excessive fees paid for record keeping, they did not show how the fees paid in relation to the services provided to the plan were out of line, according to the order.  The complaint had also alleged a fiduciary failure for not regularly soliciting competitive bids for record keeping, but the judge noted that fiduciaries are not obligated to do so.  According to a court filing Wednesday, the plaintiffs are planning to file an amended complaint."
Regulation Best Interest,"Regulators: Trading app nudges could be investment advice, trigger Reg BI",InvestmentNews | News and Opinion,InvestmentNews,"Mark Schoeff Jr.  Regulators: Trading app nudges could be investment advice, trigger Reg BI  The more individually tailored a communication to a customer is, the more likely it is a recommendation, SEC Commissioner Allison Herren Lee said during the NASAA fall meeting. The post Regulators: Trading app nudges could be investment advice, trigger Reg BI appeared first on InvestmentNews.  Nudges from trading apps that encourage investors to buy stocks could amount to investment advice and subject the online platforms to the Securities and Exchange Commission’s broker advice standard, regulators said Sunday.  SEC Commissioner Allison Herren Lee said Regulation Best Interest is triggered when an investment recommendation is made, a determination that’s based on facts and circumstances. One of the factors is whether a communication with an investor could reasonably be viewed as a call to action to trade in a particular security.  “The more individually tailored a communication is to a customer, I think, the more likely it may be to be viewed as a recommendation,” Lee said during a panel at the North American Securities Administrators Association fall meeting in Chicago.  Last month the SEC released a request for comment regarding “digital engagement practices” used by investment advisers and broker-dealers. The agency said it is looking into ways that advisers use tools that appeal to investors’ behavioral tendencies — such as game-like features known as gamification — to shape their activities on websites, portals and mobile apps.  Exploring whether digital apps encourage trading in riskier products, such as options, or trading that’s aligned with brokers’ rather than customers’ best interests and delving into compensation structures and conflicts of interest are areas the SEC should address, Lee said.  “I really look forward to hearing from retail investors and other market participants on this because it’s a really important area for us to focus on,” said Lee, who participated in the conference virtually via a video connection.  The question of whether Reg BI applies to a trading app is crucial not only to determining the reach and strength of the rule but also could have a profound affect on platforms like the popular one offered by Robinhood. The online brokerage, which is being sued by Massachusetts for violating the state’s fiduciary duty rule, maintains that it does not provide investment advice.  Maryland Securities Commissioner Melanie Senter Lubin said that when online brokers encourage customers to trade, they could be exceeding the bounds of the brokerage model.  “I’ve always wondered when do those nudges really take somebody beyond being a broker-dealer into being an investment adviser because they’re giving specific advice about a specific security, and isn’t that one of the provisions that puts you firmly in the investment adviser space [and] ups their obligation,” said Lubin, who is NASAA president-elect and spoke from the Chicago site of the state regulators’ conference.  The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority Inc. also is reviewing trading platforms and brokerages’ use of social media. It recently launched exam sweeps on how firms handle options accounts and how they use paid social media influencers — so-called “finfluencers’ — to attract new customers. It also is conducting a sweep on zero-fee trading.  “I think there is room for improving some of the rule set that we have in this space — for example, complex products, options,” Finra CEO Robert W. Cook said during the NASAA panel on Sunday, which he attended in person. “Are there appropriate disclosures — up to date — for the world we live in for investors? That’s one area I’ve asked our team to take a closer look at.”  EXTENDING REMOTE BRANCH INSPECTIONS  The panel of regulators also discussed a push by the brokerage industry to extend remote inspections of branch offices, one of the policy changes implemented during the coronavirus pandemic. Last week, Finra moved to continue the relief from on-site exams through next June.  Lee said the SEC has been hearing from registered reps and brokerages about a permanent policy change on in-person inspections.  “That’s something we’re looking at and thinking through,” she said. “To me, it seems certain that change is here, and we need to make sure we approach it wisely.”  Finra members have asked the regulator to reconsider the definition of a branch office and an office of supervisory jurisdiction after brokerages conducted their operations remotely during the pandemic.  “This is an area where a lot more thought is necessary,” Cook said. “It’s important that our rule book evolve, but those are pretty big lifts — to redefine what is an OSJ and what is a branch.”"

Use the PDF linked in the document sidebar for the official electronic format.  Start Preamble  The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”),[1]  established the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) to oversee the audits of companies that are subject to the securities laws, and related matters, in order to protect the interests of investors and further the public interest in the preparation of informative, accurate and independent audit reports. Section 982 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) [2]  amended the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to provide the PCAOB with explicit authority to oversee auditors of broker-dealers registered with the Commission. The PCAOB is to accomplish these goals through registration of public accounting firms, standard setting, inspection, and disciplinary programs. The PCAOB is subject to the comprehensive oversight of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”).  Section 109(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act directs the PCAOB to establish a budget for each fiscal year in accordance with the PCAOB's internal procedures, subject to approval by the Commission. Rule 190 of Regulation P facilitates the Commission's review and approval of PCAOB budgets and annual accounting support fees.[3]  This budget rule provides, among other things, limits on the PCAOB's ability to incur expenses and obligations except as provided in the approved budget as well as the procedures for the submission of supplemental budgets when it is forecasted that the limits to incur expenses and obligations will be exceeded in a given year. The Commission previously determined that the PCAOB's 2021 budget of $287.3 million was consistent with Section 109 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and accordingly, it approved the PCAOB's 2021 budget on December 16, 2020.[4]  During 2021, the PCAOB determined that expenses related to the engagement of outside counsel would cause its Start Printed Page 52713 Office of the General Counsel to spend amounts exceeding the previously approved program area budget for the year. As a result, on July 14, 2021 it submitted a supplemental budget to the SEC. The PCAOB's 2021 supplemental budget requests Commission approval to transfer $3.4 million of FY 2021 funding from a certain program area in which all funds allocated are projected to not be spent in 2021 to the Office of the General Counsel to cover the projected excess costs related to the engagement of outside counsel. The supplemental budget does not request an increase to the PCAOB's previously approved 2021 budget of $287.3 million.  The Commission directs the PCAOB to keep the Commission, through staff in its Office of the Chief Accountant, apprised each month of monthly legal expenses incurred and paid through the end of its fiscal year 2021. Separately, the Commission directs that the PCAOB implement policies and procedures to ensure additional funds will not be required for spending on outside counsel for the 2021 fiscal year beyond those approved in this Order. The Commission also directs the PCAOB to inform the Commission of all of the steps it will take to reduce its current and future reliance on outside counsel.  The Commission has determined that the PCAOB's 2021 supplemental budget is consistent with Section 109 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Accordingly,  It is ordered, pursuant to Section 109 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, that the PCAOB supplemental budget for calendar year 2021 is approved.  Start Signature  By the Commission.  Vanessa A.

SAFE Banking Act,The Daily Chase: Toronto real estate broker laughs at housing pledges; Fed decision day,BNN Bloomberg | Economics,BNN Bloomberg,"Noah Zivitz  The Daily Chase: Toronto real estate broker laughs at housing pledges; Fed decision day  First Look With Surveillance: Fed Expectations, Evergrande  Toronto real estate broker John Pasalis laughed at Greg when asked about campaign housing pledges and whether any of them make sense for addressing affordability. Check out that refreshingly candid reaction, and why Pasalis (like many other guests we’ve spoken with) fears the Liberals’ strategy will backfire and actually drive up prices. Mattamy Homes Founder Peter Gilgan was even more blunt, telling us “we need to declare that we’re at war with affordability.” We’ll have plenty more insight in the days ahead about what to expect in Justin Trudeau’s third mandate, including this afternoon when CAPREIT CEO Mark Kenney joins Greg to discuss the Liberals’ targeting of real estate investment trusts. We’ll note here that the Prime Minister’s Office released a readout yesterday evening from Trudeau’s call with U.S. President Joe Biden; the two “committed to getting together in person soon.”  FED DAY  Markets will find out this afternoon if the U.S. Federal Reserve is prepared to fine-tune its language about taper timing. Last we heard from Chair Jerome Powell in his Jackson Hole speech, he confirmed that the central bank thinks it will be in a position to scale back asset purchases before the end of this year, but signaled ""considerable"" progress was still needed to attain maximum employment. Since then, we saw August non-farm payrolls that fell way short of expectations. The policy statement and updated forecasts land at 2 p.m.; followed by Powell’s news conference a half hour later.  EVERGRANDE WATCH  The debt-laden Chinese property developer that’s captured the financial world’s attention amid concern (seemingly misplaced, at least for now) that it could be heading toward a Lehman moment has managed to assuage some immediate fear, while simultaneously stirring confusion. China Evergrande Group said in a regulatory filing that it “resolved” an interest payment coming due tomorrow, without providing many details. Meanwhile, less than 24 hours ago, Bloomberg Intelligence Analyst Damian Sassower told us the big question surrounding Evergrande was what the People’s Bank of China was prepared to do about it. Overnight, it pumped additional liquidity into the financial system in a reverse repo operation. That all added up to a steady session in Asia, where the Shanghai Composite closed flat after a two-day holiday.

DOL Conflict of Interest Rule,Davies v Ford & Ors [2021] EWHC 2550 (Ch) (22 September 2021),BAILII | Recent Decisions,British and Irish Legal Information Institute (BAILII),"Davies v Ford & Ors [2021] EWHC 2550 (Ch) (22 September 2021)  INTRODUCTION  In this claim the Claimant, Mr Davies, as assignee of the company Greenbox Recycling Limited (""GBR"") claims relief against the First and Second Defendants (""Mr Ford"" and ""Mr Monks""), who were directors of GBR, for breach of fiduciary duty owed by them to GBR and against the Third Defendant, Greenbox Recycling Kent Limited (""GBRK""), for knowing receipt.  On 26th February 2019 a split trial was ordered. At the initial, or liability, trial the following issues were listed for determination:  (1) whether [Mr Monks] has acted in breach of duty or in breach of contract; (2) whether [GBRK] is fixed with the relevant knowledge to ground a claim in knowing receipt; (3) whether the business conducted by [GBRK] is derived from [GBR]; (4) whether [Mr Monks] is in principle entitled to an equitable allowance; (5) whether [Mr Davies'] equitable claims are barred by [Mr Davies'] lack of clean hands or laches; (6) whether the Defendant [presumably Mr Monks] should be relieved from liability pursuant to s. 1157 Companies Act 2006.  The order added:  For the avoidance of doubt, the quantum of any equitable or proprietary interest in the Business (as defined in the Particulars of Claim) to which [Mr Davies] may be entitled if he elects for equitable relief shall be the subject of the trial of quantum, not liability.  The liability trial was heard before Adam Johnson QC (as he then was) sitting as a Deputy Judge of the Chancery Division (""the Judge"") in November 2019. In a lengthy and detailed judgment dated 24th March 2020 (the neutral citation for which is [2020] EWHC 686 (Ch)-""the judgment""), the Judge, in summary: entered judgment in default against Mr Ford for breach of fiduciary duty; held that Mr Monks had been guilty of breaches of fiduciary duty; held that GBRK was liable in knowing receipt.  The resultant order dated 24th March 2020 (but stamped on 3rd April 2020) provided as follows:  Relief Consequential on Judgment 1. Mr Monks shall, by 4.00 p.m. on 21 April 2020, pay to Mr Davies the sum of £170,685 in respect of funds belonging to Green Box Recycling Ltd (""GBR"") that Mr Monks converted to his own use, which sum shall be paid subject to partial set-off, as provided in paragraph 14 below. 2. Judgment be entered for Mr Davies (i) against Mr Ford and Mr Monks for equitable compensation; and (ii) against GBRK for knowing receipt. 3. The nature, extent and quantum of (i) equitable compensation payable by Mr Ford and Mr Monks; (ii) any equitable allowance granted to Mr Monks; and (iii) the proprietary and/or personal remedy to be granted to Mr Davies in respect of the business conducted by GBRK be determined at a further trial (the ""Quantum Trial"").  The Quantum Trial was heard before me on 14th to 16th and 19th to 26th April 2021 and this is my judgment on the issues on which determination was sought.  As summarised in his Closing Submissions, Mr Shaw (who appeared with the assistance of Ms Staynings for Mr Davies) described the relief which Mr Davies sought as follows. He has a primary case and an alternative or secondary case.  In his primary case, Mr Davies seeks the following relief against GBRK and Mr Monks:  (1)	As against GBRK as knowing recipient, Mr Davies seeks: i.	a declaration that GBRK holds the freehold of the Ashford Site on constructive trust for Mr Davies (as assignee of GBR); and ii.	an account of profits extending to the present day and/or equitable compensation (amounting to the current value of GBRK less the value of the Ashford Site);  As will be seen the ""Ashford Site"" is a reference to the site, now owned by GBRK, from which it trades. I shall refer to it hereafter as ""the Site"".  (2)	If such primary relief is granted against GBRK, Mr Davies is, he says, prepared to leave out of the order for relief the very significant sums which have otherwise been extracted from GBRK in the form of dividends, remuneration and benefits (save for the specific categories set out below); and (3)	As against Mr Monks, Mr Davies seeks equitable compensation in the form of restoring to Mr Davies the following sums which have been wrongly extracted from GBRK: i.	sums paid by GBRK to Cripps LLP and/or Counsel acting for Mr Monks/GBRK in connection with the current dispute; ii.	all sums paid or borrowed by GBRK to finance the acquisition by Boite Verte Ltd (""BVL"") of shares in Caja Verde Ltd (""CVL"") from Alan and Charlene Hogg or John Bennett; iii.	all GBRK funds used to finance the purchase and development of Mr Monks' personal property situated at Golford Stables, Golford Road, Golford, Cranbrook (""the Cranbrook Property"").  In his alternative case, Mr Davies seeks the following relief against GBRK and Mr Monks, which, he asserts, broadly reflects the commercial intention of the parties in mid- to late 2010, namely that: GBR would take over the trading operations from the Site; Mr Ford and Mr Monks would be entitled to remuneration of £3,000 per month; and that Mr Davies would exit the business in around 5 years.  (1)	As against GBRK as knowing recipient, Mr Davies seeks: i.	a declaration that GBRK holds the freehold of the Ashford Site on constructive trust for Mr Davies (as assignee of GBR); and ii.	an account of profits extending to 31 December 2015 and/or equitable compensation (amounting to the value of GBRK at 31 December 2015); and (2)	As against Mr Monks, Mr Davies seeks equitable compensation in the form of restoring to Mr Davies all sums which were extracted from GBRK for the benefit of Mr Monks (whether in the form of dividends, remuneration or other unauthorised payments) in excess of the sum of £3,000 per month until 31 December 2015.  As against Mr Ford, Mr Davies in any event seeks equitable compensation to restore to Mr Davies all sums which were extracted from GBRK for the benefit of Mr Ford (whether in the form of dividends, remuneration or other unauthorised payments) in excess of an allowance of £3,000 per month until the sale of Mr Ford's shareholding in GBRK on around 6 September 2013.  The issues  The parties were agreed as to the issues which I have to determine. They were helpfully set out in an agreed List of Issues as follows:  Claims against Mr Ford and Mr Monks  (1)	How much equitable compensation (if any) is payable by Mr Ford and Mr Monks? In particular: (a) Is Mr Monks liable to pay equitable compensation in respect of all business, business opportunities, property, assets, income and benefits obtained by Mr Ford and Mr Monks for GBRK on or before 18 October 2011 (as asserted by Mr Davies)? (b) Alternatively to (a), is it open to Mr Monks to assert that he is liable to pay equitable compensation only in respect of the seven matters referred to in paragraph 272 of the judgment or is that issue res judicata (as asserted by Mr Davies)? If that issue is not res judicata, is Mr Monks' liability to pay equitable compensation limited to the matters referred to in paragraph 272? (c) Having regard to the issues determined at the trial on liability, is it open to Mr Monks to argue at the quantum trial that GBR would not have built a waste management business at the Site (the ""Counterfactual Defence"") or is that barred by res judicata and/or abuse of process (as asserted by Mr Davies)? (d) If the answer to (c) is that it is open to Mr Monks to rely on the Counterfactual Defence, is the issue of whether GBR would have built a waste management business relevant to the quantification of the equitable compensation payable by Mr Monks in respect of the seven matters listed in paragraph 272 of the judgment (as asserted by Mr Monks) or is that issue irrelevant to the compensation payable in respect of those matters (as asserted by Mr Davies)? (e) If the Court finds that it is open to Mr Monks to rely on the Counterfactual Defence and to the extent that the issue is legally relevant, would GBR in fact have built a waste management business at the Site? If so, should the Court impose a restriction on Mr Monks' liability to pay compensation similar to the approach of WARMAN INTERNATIONAL LTD V DWYER [1995] HCA 18, and if so, what should this restriction be and what award is proper compensation? (f) Is it relevant how much remuneration and benefits Mr Ford and Monks have received from GBR and GBRK, (as contended by Mr Davies), or is the proper measure of equitable compensation the net profits GBR would have made had Mr Monks performed his duties, without any assessment of Mr Monks' personal benefits (as contended by Mr Monks)? If Mr Davies is correct, how much remuneration and benefits have they received? Have these individuals received any disguised remuneration and benefits (in the form of ""fuel"" repayments or otherwise)? Has GBRK financed the purchase or acquisition of the Cranbrook Property? (g) In particular, but subject to 1(f) above, are Mr Ford and Mr Monks liable to pay equitable compensation in respect of the following payments made by GBRK (as alleged by Mr Davies) or are the following payments irrelevant to the determination of equitable compensation (as alleged by Mr Monks)? (i) remuneration and benefits received by Mr Ford and Mr Monks; (ii) dividends; (iii) sums paid to finance the acquisition of shares in GBRK or connected companies; (iv) legal fees in connection with these proceedings; (v) the sums (if any) paid to finance the purchase and development of the Cranbrook Property. (h) If Mr Monks is liable to pay equitable compensation, is he entitled to an allowance in respect of services provided by him to GBRK? If so, what is the quantum of that allowance? (i) How much interest is payable by Mr Monks on the sum of £170,685.88 misappropriated by him from GBR? Is Mr Davies entitled to interest on any other sums due to him from Mr Ford and Mr Monks?  Claims against GBRK  (2)	Having elected for equitable compensation against Mr Ford and Mr Monks, is it open to Mr Davies to elect for a declaration of constructive trusteeship and/or an account of profits as against GBRK? If so, and if a remedy is awarded against more than one Defendant or if multiple remedies are awarded against one or more Defendants, how should the awards be set off against one another? (3)	Is GBRK's liability as a knowing recipient restricted to its receipt of pre-existing property transferred to it in breach of Mr Monks' duties to GBR as set out in paragraph 272 of the judgment (as asserted by GBRK) or does GBRK's liability extend beyond paragraph 272 to all business, business opportunities, property, assets, income and benefits received by GBRK in breach of Mr Ford's and Mr Monks' duties as directors of GBR (as asserted by Mr Davies)? On either case, what property was received and when? (4)	In respect of which (if any) of GBRK's assets is Mr Davies entitled to a declaration of constructive trusteeship? In particular, is he entitled to a declaration that GBRK holds the Site on constructive trust? (5)	Should the Court refuse an account of profits as a matter of discretion? If Mr Davies is entitled to an account of profits, is he entitled to such an account from 22 May 2011 to date? If not, is he entitled to an account of profits for a shorter period of time and, if so, what is that period? (6)	Is it open to GBRK to claim an equitable allowance, having regard to the issues already determined at the trial on liability and directions given by the Court? If so, is an equitable allowance available, as a matter of law, to a knowing recipient? If an equitable allowance is available, as a matter of law, should GBRK be granted such an allowance? If so, what is the quantum of that allowance? (7)	If Mr Davies is entitled to an account of profits, what is the sum payable by GBRK to Mr Davies? (8)	If, having elected for equitable compensation against Mr Ford and Mr Monks, Mr Davies elected (or must be treated as having elected) for equitable compensation against GBRK, how much equitable compensation (if any) is payable by GBRK? (9)	Is Mr Davies entitled to interest on any sums due to him from GBRK?  THE BACKGROUND FACTS  In the judgment, the Judge set out the relevant background facts with clarity and in detail. I would refer to the following paragraphs of the judgment: paragraphs 1 to 10 and 25 to 245. I do not intend to repeat that exercise in this judgment.  Unless otherwise indicated, I will, in this judgment, adopt the same shorthand as did the Judge.  THE JUDGMENT  However, it is necessary to refer to and highlight certain paragraphs in the judgment both to put into context the issues I have to determine and because the meaning and effect of certain of them is in issue between the parties before me.  In paragraph 68 of the judgment, the Judge records his findings as to Mr Davies' intentions as at Autumn 2010:  It is thus clear that by this stage, Mr Davies had determined to abandon his plans for sale, and instead had determined to build up the operations at the Ashford Site and look to sell at some future stage, when the operations had grown in scale. For this purpose, as will appear below, Mr Davies wished to make further use of the new brand he had developed-Greenbox Recycling-and make use of the new company he had incorporated back in March 2010 but which so far had not traded, namely GBR.  In paragraphs 82 to 89 of the judgment the Judge deals with the Heads of Terms document which, he finds in paragraph 84, is ""important in that it gives an indication of Mr Davies' intentions and his vision for the future"". In paragraphs 88 and 89 he finds that the Heads of Terms document was sent to, and received by, Mr Monks on 13 September 2010.  He describes the Heads of Terms in paragraph 85 of the judgment as follows:  The HoT is headed "" SUBJECT TO CONTRACT "", and "" Proposed creation of new trading company under the name Greenbox Recycling Limited ('Greenbox') and off- shore holding company ('BVI Co') and terms of management of Greenbox and allotment of share options in BVI Co"". It sets out a proposed new structure for the companies operating from the Ashford Site, and a plan for the development of the business operating from the Site. The main features relevant for present purposes were as follows: i) The existing corporate structure, with KAD Capital as holding company owning all the issued shares in SIK, was to be replaced with a new structure under which an offshore holding company, "" BVI Co ."", was to be holder of the entire issued share capital of KAD Capital. ii) The trading business of SIK was to be transferred to GBR "" for nominal consideration "", and GBR would become the "" new trading company of the KAD Capital/BVI Co group of companies "". GBR was to undergo a "" rebranding and capital investment exercise."" This was to be facilitated by a proposed new factoring arrangement to be entered into by GBR ("" [GBR] will seek to secure confidential invoice discounting facilities from HSBC ."") More particularly: ""KD, RM and PF shall agree the terms of the capital investment in [GBR] subject to the availability of the above CID [i.e., Confidential Invoice Discounting Facility] or other banking facilities. The intention of the parties subject to suitable funding is for the business to be rebranded and for the replacement of the 3x18 tonne lorries, the 1x7½ tonne lorry and the 32 tonne RoRo. The replacement programme will be subject to available funding and cash needs of the business."" iii) As to the assets presently used by SIK, ""The vehicles, plant and equipment used by SIK shall continue to be owned by [Nero].

As a result, on July 14, 2021 it   submitted a supplemental budget to the   SEC. The PCAOB’s 2021 supplemental   budget requests Commission approval to   transfer $3.4 million of FY 2021 funding   from a certain program area in which all   funds allocated are projected to not be   spent in 2021 to the Office of the   General Counsel to cover the projected   excess costs related to the engagement   of outside counsel. The supplemental   budget does not request an increase to   the PCAOB’s previously approved 2021   budget of $287.3 million.   The Commission directs the PCAOB   to keep the Commission, through staff in   its Office of the Chief Accountant,   apprised each month of monthly legal   expenses incurred and paid through the   end of its fiscal year 2021. Separately,   the Commission directs that the PCAOB   implement policies and procedures to   ensure additional funds will not be   required for spending on outside   counsel for the 2021 fiscal year beyond   those approved in this Order. The   Commission also directs the PCAOB to   inform the Commission of all of the   steps it will take to reduce its current   and future reliance on outside counsel.   The Commission has determined that   the PCAOB’s 2021 supplemental budget   is consistent with Section 109 of the   Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the   Securities Exchange Act of 1934   (‘‘Act’’),  1  and Rule 19b–4 thereunder,  2  notice is hereby given that on   September 14, 2021, the Investors   Exchange LLC (‘‘IEX’’ or the   ‘‘Exchange’’) filed with the Securities   and Exchange Commission   (‘‘Commission’’) the proposed rule   change as described in Items I and II   below, which Items have been prepared   by the self-regulatory organization. The   Commission is publishing this notice to   solicit comments on the proposed rule   change from interested persons.   I. Self-Regulatory Organization’s   Statement of the Terms of Substance of   the Proposed Rule Change   Pursuant to the provisions of Section   19(b)(1) under the Act,  3  and Rule 19b–   4 thereunder,  4  IEX is filing with the   Commission a proposed rule change to   provide that a reserve order may have (i)   an odd lot sized display quantity and   (ii) an optional random initial and   replenishment display quantity. The   Exchange has designated this rule   change as ‘‘non-controversial’’ under   Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act  5  and   provided the Commission with the   notice required by Rule 19b–4(f)(6)   thereunder.  6  The text of the proposed rule change   is available at the Exchange’s website at   www.iextrading.com,   at the principal   office of the Exchange, and at the   Commission’s Public Reference Room.   II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s   Statement of the Purpose of, and the   Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule   Change   In its filing with the Commission, the   self-regulatory organization included   statements concerning the purpose of   and basis for the proposed rule change   and discussed any comments it received   on the proposed rule change. The text   of these statements may be examined at   the places specified in Item IV below.   The self-regulatory organization has   prepared summaries, set forth in   Sections A, B, and C below, of the most   significant aspects of such statements.   A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s   Statement of the Purpose of, and the   Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule   Change   1. Purpose   The purpose of the proposed rule   filing is to amend IEX Rule 11.190(b)(2)   to provide that a reserve order  7  may   have (i) an odd lot  8  size display   quantity and (ii) an optional random   initial and replenishment display   quantity. Specifically, as proposed, a   reserve order may have an odd lot as   well as a round or mixed lot initial and   replenishment display quantity. In   addition, as proposed, a Member  9  may   attach an optional random   replenishment instruction to any reserve   order pursuant to which the reserve   order’s display quantity (both upon   initial posting to the Order Book  10  and   upon any subsequent replenishments)   would be randomly determined by the   System  11  within a replenishment range   specified by the Member. In addition,   IEX proposes to make conforming edits   to IEX Rules 11.190(b)(2) and   11.220(a)(1)(C) reflecting the proposed   changes to reserve order functionality.   The proposed changes are designed to   increase displayed liquidity on the   Exchange (potentially at prices better   than the NBBO),  12  to the benefit of all   market participants, by providing   additional optionality to Members in the   use of odd lot size reserve order   displayed quantities, as well as helping   to protect Members using reserve orders   with random replenishment from   potential information leakage.   Background   IEX, like other equities exchanges,  13  offers Members a ‘‘reserve’’ order type,   which allows Members to submit a   partially displayed limit order,  14  so that   a portion of the order is displayed   (‘‘display quantity’’) and a portion of the   order is non-displayed (‘‘reserve   quantity’’).  15  As set forth in IEX Rule   11.190(b)(2), when Users  16  submit a   reserve order, they must specify the   display quantity (which must be a   round or mixed lot). Upon entry, the   System attempts to execute a reserve   order as a single order of its full,   unexecuted size. If an incoming reserve   order is not fully executed, it posts to   the Order Book where it is effectively   VerDate Sep<11>2014  16:44 Sep 21, 2021 Jkt 253001 PO 00000 Frm 00082 Fmt 4703 Sfmt 4703 E:\FR\FM\22SEN1.SGM 22SEN1  52714    Federal Register   / Vol. 86, No. 181 / Wednesday, September 22, 2021 / Notices   17   See   IEX Rule 11.190(h)(1).   18   See   IEX Rule 11.190(h)(2).   19   See   Securities Exchange Act Release No. 90933   (January 15, 2021), 86 FR 6687 (January 22, 2021)   (SR–IEX–2021–01).   20   See supra   note 19.   21   See   Securities Exchange Act Release No. 83768   (August 3, 2018), 83 FR 39488 (August 9, 2018). The   fact that, until 2018, NYSE triggered replenishment   with any partial execution of the display portion of   a reserve order shows that only replenishing a   reserve order when it decrements to less than a   round lot is not the only Commission-approved   replenishment trigger.   22   See   BZX Rule 21.1(d)(1); Cboe EDGX Exchange,   Inc. (‘‘EDGX’’) Rule 21.1(d)(1).   23   As of July 2021, there are 21 securities trading   for $1,000 per share or more, and an additional 38   securities trading between $500 and $999.99 per   share.   24   See   Securities Exchange Act Release No. 90610   (December 9, 2020), 86 FR 18596, 18616 n. 240   (April 9, 2021) (‘‘Market Data Infrastructure Final   Rule’’).   treated as two discrete orders: The User   instructed display quantity posts to the   Order Book as a displayed order   (‘‘displayed portion’’) and the reserve   quantity posts to the Order Book as a   non-displayed order (‘‘non-displayed   portion’’). For the purposes of pricing   reserve orders on the Order Book,   displayed portions are treated as   displayed orders and non-displayed   portions are treated as non-displayed   orders. As described in IEX Rule   11.190(h), it is possible for the non-   displayed portion to rest at a different   price than the displayed portion,   because the displayed portion is subject   to display-price sliding  17  while the non-   displayed portion is subject to the   Midpoint Price Constraint.  18  If the   displayed portion of the reserve order is   decremented such that less than one   round lot would be displayed, the   displayed portion of the reserve order   shall be refreshed for either (i) the   original displayed quantity, or (ii) the   entire reserve quantity, if the total   number of unexecuted shares in the   order is smaller than the original   Member instructed displayed quantity.   Each time the displayed portion of the   order is refreshed from the reserve   quantity, that portion is prioritized   behind other existing displayed orders;   the priority of the non-displayed   portion, however, is unchanged by the   refresh process.   IEX recently implemented a rule   change that provides for the option to   display odd lot size orders, including   allowing them to aggregate to form a   protected quotation.  19  In connection   with the implementation of displayed   odd lot size orders, IEX modified its   reserve order functionality to provide   that if the display quantity of a reserve   order decrements to less than a round   lot (and there are not enough shares   remaining in the reserve quantity to   refresh the display quantity to more   than a round lot), the display quantity   retains its displayed status and its   execution priority.  20  Proposal   IEX proposes to amend IEX Rule   11.190(b)(2) to: (i) Allow reserve orders   to be submitted with an odd lot sized   display portion; and (ii) allow Members   to elect that the initial and   replenishment display quantity for the   reserve order will be randomly   determined by the System within a   range specified by the Member. As   described below, IEX believes this   proposal, which combines order types   and functionality previously considered   by the Commission, will encourage the   posting of more displayed liquidity on   the Exchange in a manner that benefits   all market participants.   1. Odd Lot Display Quantity Reserve   Orders   IEX proposes to modify its reserve   order type to allow Members to submit   a reserve order with an odd lot size   display quantity, in addition to the   current functionality which allows   Members to submit a reserve order with   either a round or mixed lot size display   quantity.   As proposed, odd lot size display   quantity reserve orders (‘‘Displayed Odd   Lot Reserve orders’’) would function   much like a round or mixed lot size   display quantity reserve order, except   that the display quantity would only   replenish from the reserve quantity   when the displayed portion of the order   is decremented to zero shares, as   opposed to round and mixed lot size   display quantity reserve orders, which   would continue to replenish the display   quantity whenever they decrement to   less than a round lot. IEX believes that   replenishing a Displayed Odd Lot   Reserve order only when the display   quantity has been fully exhausted is the   most reasonable and workable   approach. As a threshold matter, the   display quantity of a Displayed Odd Lot   Reserve order by definition will always   be less than a round lot and will vary   based on the Member instructed   displayed quantity and can be as low as   one share. Therefore, the trigger for   replenishment cannot be a quantity that   is the same for all orders unless it is   when the displayed quantity   decrements to zero.   IEX notes that it also considered   having Displayed Odd Lot Reserve   orders replenish anytime one or more   share of the displayed portion was   executed, but decided against it for the   following reasons. First, as a practical   matter, Displayed Odd Lot Reserve   orders will be far less useful to Members   if any partial executions of the display   portion trigger a replenishment,   resulting in the display portion   receiving a new time stamp and being   prioritized behind all other existing   displayed orders at that price. Second,   as discussed below, a Displayed Odd   Lot Reserve order would be eligible for   optional random replenishment, which   means the next time the display   quantity of the order replenishes, it   could be randomly set at a value lower   than the prior display quantity, and IEX   seeks to avoid this confusing and   illogical outcome. Third, IEX believes   that having a Displayed Odd Lot   Reserve Order replenish any time there   is a partial execution of the displayed   portion of the order could increase the   likelihood of adverse selection through   information leakage of the presence of a   larger non-displayed reserve portion of   the order. IEX notes that the   Commission made the same   determination when it approved a 2018   rule filing by the New York Stock   Exchange LLC (‘‘NYSE’’) that changed   NYSE’s reserve order replenishment   trigger from replenishing after any   execution of a portion of the displayed   quantity to only replenishing when the   display quantity decrements to less than   a round lot.  21  Based on informal   discussions with Members, IEX believes   that the proposed approach would lead   to increased use of Displayed Odd Lot   Reserve orders compared to other   approaches, as discussed above. IEX   also notes that this proposed approach   to Displayed Odd Lot Reserve order   replenishment mirrors the functionality   of options exchanges with reserve order   types that display in odd lot quantities   that replenish their display quantity   only when it is fully exhausted.  22  IEX believes that providing for   Displayed Odd Lot Reserve orders will   incentivize the posting of more   displayed liquidity on IEX, and the   corresponding opportunity for market   participants to interact with displayed   liquidity. In this regard, IEX believes   that the increasing prevalence of high-   priced securities (including many   securities that trade for more than   $1,000 per share)  23  makes quoting in   round lot multiples inaccessible to some   market participants. As the Commission   recently noted, ‘‘a significant propor"
European Banking Authority,Former Kwara State governor loses properties to AMCON over N5bn debt,Businessday NG | Latest News,Businessday NG,"Former Kwara State governor loses properties to AMCON over N5bn debt  The Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) has taken over a mansion and other properties belonging to Abdulfatah Ahmed, former governor of Kwara state, over a N5 billion debt.  The development comes barely 24 hours after Ahmed, alongside a former chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission, Attahiru Jega; and foremost Nigerian professor of Political Economy, Pat Utomi, unveiled the Rescue Nigeria Project ahead of the 2023 elections  According to Jude Nwauzor, AMCON’s spokesperson, “Early today and in compliance with the court order, AMCON through the Law firm of Chief Robert Ohuoba of Robert Ohuoba & Co, one of the leading Asset Management Partners (AMPs) of AMCON who also received protective orders from the court, took possession of the mansion belonging to the former Governor situate at Abdulfatah Street, GRA, Ilorin, Kwara State”.  AMCON also noted that it had taken over the Non-Performing Loans of the former governor and his companies, Trans Properties and Investment Limited and Trans It Consulting Limited, from the former Intercontinental Bank, FinBank, and Bank PHB during the first phase of EBA purchases, in line with its mandate under the AMCON Act.  Read also: Five takeaways from Nigeria’s biggest banks’ half-year results  “All efforts to peacefully resolve the loan had been frustrated by the former Governor who remained recalcitrant, which left AMCON no other choice than to seek justice in court,” a statement from AMCON said.  AMCON said announced the commencement of asset tracing through its appointed law firm of Robert Ohuoba & Co. on Abdulfatah Ahmed, an exercise, which further revealed nine properties of the obligor situate in Kwara, Lagos State and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja, which the Corporation has plans to enforce upon.  Other assets of the former governor which the court granted AMCON possession over include properties on: No 13, Alhaji Masha Road, Surulere; No. 9 Wharf, Apapa, Lagos; Plot 3632, Cadastral Zone E27 of Apo, Abuja; Plot 4115, Cadastral Zone F14 of Bazango, Abuja; Plot 8502, Cadastral Zone E31 of Carraway Dallas, Abuja; Plot 494, Cadastral Zone E31 of Carraway Dallas, Abuja; Plot 719, Cadastral Zone E23 of Kyami, Abuja.  The court also ruled that AMCON should take possession of any other landed property owned by Abdulfatah within Nigeria."
SAFE Banking Act,House Passes Cannabis Banking Legislation As Part Of National Defense Authorization Bill,Bisnow | Home news,Bisnow,"House Passes Cannabis Banking Legislation As Part Of National Defense Authorization Bill  A massive step for legitimizing the cannabis industry in the U.S. has taken another tentative step forward.  Members of the House of Representatives voted on Tuesday night to include the SAFE Banking Act in the National Defense Authorization Act just before the latter's passage, Bloomberg reports. The defense spending bill now moves to the Senate, which has declined to advance the SAFE Banking Act the four previous times it reached that chamber on its own.  The SAFE Banking Act protects banks and financial institutions from being sanctioned by the federal government for doing business with cannabis-related firms. As it stands now, medical and recreational dispensaries are forced to do their business in cash, and all businesses in the cannabis industry finance themselves either through alternative capital sources or from their own balance sheet.  The legal limbo in which cannabis-related businesses have operated since states began legalizing marijuana for medical use has also led plenty of landlords to avoid leasing to dispensaries. The SAFE Banking Act enjoys broad support from the business community, Bloomberg reports, and the House's most recent attempt to get the Senate to take up the bill passed by a 321-101 vote in April, with votes from both sides of the aisle.  Rep. Ed Perlmutter, who introduced the amendment adding the SAFE Banking Act to the defense spending bill, argued that forcing cannabis-related businesses to deal exclusively in cash presents a security risk, Bloomberg reports. Regardless of the justification for its inclusion, nesting the banking legislation within the national defense bill improves its chances of passage, finance brokerage BTIG analyst Camilo Lyon said in a research note reported by Bloomberg.  ""No senator wants to be viewed as holding up the massive, 1,700-page, must-pass NDAA simply because of SAFE banking,” Lyon wrote."

Fair Debt Collection Practices Act,DFPI Sanctions Debt Collector in First Action Under the California Consumer Financial Protection Law,California Department of Business Oversight | Updates,California Department of Business Oversight,"DFPI Sanctions Debt Collector in First Action Under the California Consumer Financial Protection Law  The DFPI today issued its first enforcement action against a debt collector and debt buyer.  Download this press release (PDF)  SACRAMENTO – The California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) today issued its first enforcement action against a debt collector and debt buyer, Murrieta-based F & F Management Inc. (F & F), for violating the California Consumer Financial Protection Law (CCFPL) by unlawfully threatening to sue consumers and garnish their wages, and submitting negative information to a credit bureau without notifying consumers as required, a practice known in the industry as debt parking.  “The DFPI will not tolerate any unlawful, unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in collecting debts,” said DFPI Senior Deputy Commissioner of the Consumer Financial Protection Division Suzanne Martindale. “Debt collection is one of the DFPI’s top complaint types. This action highlights just some of the unlawful and unfair acts that can cause enormous harm to consumers and plague the debt collection industry, and the ways the DFPI can address them.”  The DFPI has received multiple complaints from Californians and consumers across the country regarding the practices of F & F, and accounts for a significant portion of recent complaints regarding debt collectors. The DFPI found that F & F left recorded voice mails that failed to disclose the caller’s ID, threatened illegal lawsuits and wage garnishment, and failed to notify consumers in writing before or within 30 days of transmitting negative credit information to a credit bureau.  The DFPI issued a Desist and Refrain Order and Order Assessing Penalties totaling $375,000 to F & F for numerous violations of law, including violations of the Rosenthal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (Rosenthal), the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), and the Consumer Credit Reporting Agencies Act (CCRAA).  As of Sept. 1, all debt collectors operating in California can now apply to be licensed by the Department, representing the first step in increased state oversight that will include an assessment of applications, formal examinations, and protections for California consumers. Debt collectors, debt buyers, and debt collection attorneys operating in the state may now submit their license applications online at the Nationwide Multistate Licensing System (NMLS).  The recently enacted Debt Collection Licensing Act (DCLA), which was passed in the state Legislature last year as SB 908, requires that all debt collectors submit a license application prior to Jan. 1, 2022, to continue operating in California next year.  The new law also authorizes the DFPI to take in borrowers’ complaints and enforce violations. It will give consumers a single location to check whether companies are licensed, and whether they have been subject to any enforcement actions, including license suspensions or revocations.  In addition to regulating debt collectors, the DFPI licenses and regulates financial products and services, including state-chartered banks and credit unions, student loan servicers, commodities and investment advisers, money transmitters, the offer and sale of securities and franchises, broker-dealers, non-bank installment lenders, payday lenders, mortgage lenders and servicers, escrow companies, PACE administrators, rent-to-own contractors, credit repair companies, consumer credit reporting agencies, debt-relief companies, and more."

European Banking Authority,N5bn Debt: AMCON Takes Over Ex-Kwara Governor’s Mansion,Leadership Newspaper | Latest,Leadership Newspaper,"Bukola Idowu  Abdullahi Olesin  N5bn Debt: AMCON Takes Over Ex-Kwara Governor’s Mansion  Following the order of Hon. Justice A.M. Liman of the Federal High Court, Lagos Division, the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) yesterday September 22, 2021, in Ilorin, the Kwara State capital took over the palatial mansion of Alhaji Abdulfatah Ahmed, the former two-time governor of Kwara State over indebtedness of nearly N5 billion.  Hon. Justice A.M. Liman also ordered the freezing of the bank accounts of the former governor and his two companies including Trans Properties and Investment Limited and Trans It Consulting Limited in Suit No: FHC/L/AMC/01/2021.  However, the ex-governor said the reported takeover of his Ilorin property by a lawyer purporting to represent AMCON was unnecessary and overzealous due to ongoing talks to resolve previous transactions with two defunct banks.  In a statement by his media aide, Wahab Oba, Ahmed clarified that the dispute was based on a margin loan he secured from Intercontinental Bank and Finbank in 2009 for the purchase of shares which was then lumped with unrelated loans obtained by others.  Commenting on a viral video depicting the takeover of his residence by an individual who claimed to represent the company, Ahmed explained that the banks held the shares as collateral to sell and recover the loans in the event of a default.  He said the banks passed the loans to AMCON instead of selling the shares to recover the loan amount.  Ahmed said he was in talks with AMCON to separate the liabilities before the lawyer’s conduct despite knowing the loan amount was in dispute and that reconciliation talks were ongoing.  The former assured that he would meet any outstanding obligations once the loans were disaggregated.  The former governor who is one of the founders of the newly established third force in Nigerian politics known as the Rescue Nigeria Project (RNP) is one of the high-profile obligors of AMCON.  In compliance with the court order, AMCON through the law firm of chief Robert Ohuoba of Robert Ohuoba & Co, one of the leading asset management partners (AMPs) of AMCON who also received protective orders from the court, took possession of the mansion belonging to the former governor situate at Abdulfatah Street, GRA, Ilorin, Kwara State. Mr Jude Nwauzor, head, corporate communications department of the government debt recovery agency confirmed the story via a release. He described the enforcement as successful.  AMCON had taken over the non-performing loans of the former governor and his companies, Trans Properties and Investment Limited and Trans It Consulting Limited, from the former Intercontinental Bank, FinBank and Bank PHB during the first phase of EBA purchases, in line with its mandate under the AMCON Act.  efforts to peacefully resolve the loan had been frustrated by the former governor who remained recalcitrant, which left AMCON no other choice than to seek justice in court.  AMCON had to commence asset tracing through its appointed law firm of Robert Ohuoba & Co. on Abdulfatah Ahmed, an exercise, which further revealed nine (9) properties of the obligor in Kwara, Lagos State and the Federal Capital territory (FCT), Abuja, which the corporation has plans to enforce upon.  According to the agency, the action is in line with Section 49 (1) of the AMCON Act 2019 (As Amended), which states that: 49 (1)Where the Corporation has reasonable cause to believe that a debtor or debtor company is the bona fide owner of any movable or immovable property, it may apply to the Court, before or at the time of filing of action for debt recovery or other like action or at any time after the filing of action, and before or after the service of the originating process by which such action is commenced on the debtor or debtor company, by motion ex-parte for an interlocutory order granting possession of the property to the Corporation pending the hearing and determination of the debt recovery or other action to abide the decision in such action.  Other assets of the former governor, which the court granted AMCON possession over include: No 13, Alhaji Masha Road, Surulere; No. 9 Wharf, Apapa, Lagos; Plot 3632, Cadastral Zone E27 of Apo, Abuja; Plot 4115, Cadastral Zone F14 of Bazango, Abuja; Plot 8502, Cadastral Zone E31 of Carraway Dallas, Abuja; Plot 494, Cadastral Zone E31 of Carraway Dallas, Abuja; Plot 719, Cadastral Zone E23 of Kyami, Abuja; and any other landed property in any place that may be found within the Federal Republic of Nigeria."
LIMRA,"Before You Sign Up for Health Insurance at Work, Read This",Kiplinger Personal Finance | Latest Updates,The Kiplinger Washington Editors,"Rob Grubka  Before You Sign Up for Health Insurance at Work, Read This  It’s open enrollment time at workplaces across the country – for health insurance as well as a bevy of other benefits. Here are four tips to help navigate the maze of benefit decisions.  The fall open enrollment season for employees is upon us, which means millions of American workers will need to make a number of complex decisions when it comes to their benefit selections. In fact, typically the average employee may have to make decisions on over 17 benefits.(1) That’s a lot of decision-making responsibility — especially when you add the stress of trying to protect the financial well-being of your family as the pandemic continues.  Plus, this process will likely not get any easier this fall, as many employers plan to make changes to their benefit line-ups as a result of COVID-19. Therefore, to help navigate the maze of decisions employees will need to make during open enrollment, below are four tips to help maximize your workplace benefits.  Tip No. 1: Don’t be scared off by high-deductible health plans  The two most common types of health plans that employees have access to through their employers are preferred provider organization (PPO) and high-deductible health plans (HDHPs). The PPO option typically has a lower deductible with higher premiums, while the HDHP option typically has higher deductibles with lower premiums and is commonly paired with a tax-advantaged health savings account (HSA) — a powerful savings and spending vehicle.  To help understand why American workers choose the health plans they do during open enrollment, Voya launched a study last fall in partnership with SAVVI Financial. Interestingly, the research reveals employees often have a bias against HDHPs when compared to more traditional PPO health plans. In one part of the study, participants were presented with two different plans and told to think of them as identical in quality of care, access to care and all other features beyond cost. The only differences in the HDHP vs. PPO plans were the premiums and deductibles. Almost two-thirds of study participants (65%) selected the PPO plan — despite the fact that the study was purposefully designed so the HDHP would always be the optimal financial choice. As a result, depending on how much they used their benefits, the average employee was overspending on their health care plan by $500 to $2,500 through the year — which is money a person could be saving for retirement or putting aside for an emergency.  The study identified several reasons why employees are biased against HDHPs, and interestingly the naming of the health plan had a big impact. For example, participants were almost twice as likely to choose a PPO plan over an HDHP when the words “high deductible” were used in the plan name (65% PPO vs. 35% HDHP). This preference noticeably lessens when the plan names are unbranded (53% PPO vs. 47% HDHP).  The bottom line is that when it comes to selecting the best health plan for your family, there’s never a universal, one-size-fits-all solution. Therefore, it’s important to keep an open mind — or you could potentially end up overspending on your health plan.  Tip No. 2: Tap into the power of HSAs  COVID-19 has underscored the need for American workers to be better prepared for health expenses. A health savings account can offer several benefits for both short- and long-term health care savings. For anyone enrolled in a high-deductible health plan, HSAs can help you address immediate health costs as well as the ones you’ll have later in life when you retire.  Faced with a short-term, unexpected need — such as paying for an ER visit — many people might be tempted to dip into their retirement savings. Fortunately, funds in an HSA can double as an emergency savings account for qualified health care expenses. HSAs have the potential to offer triple tax benefits:  Contributions are not taxed.  Investment gains are not taxed.  And withdrawals for qualified medical expenses are not taxed, either.  Plus, when enrolled in a HDHP and HSA, you can choose to leave your funds in your HSA and, instead, cover a medical bill “out of pocket.” This strategy is one way HSAs can serve as a potential emergency savings vehicle for unexpected health care costs in the future. Additionally, since HSA funds roll over each year, many HSAs offer the opportunity to potentially grow your account balance by investing in long-term investment funds, such as stocks.  As a result of these features, HSAs have increased in popularity during the pandemic. Industry research shows that assets in HSAs increased 25% and the number of new HSAs increased 6% in 2020 — which brings the total number of HSAs to approximately 30 million in the U.S. For 2022, the IRS has also increased HSA contribution limits to $3,650 per year for individuals and $7,300 for families. Individuals who are 55 and older are eligible for an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution.  Tip No. 3: Don’t overlook group life insurance  The pandemic has caused many people — both young and old — to reflect on their own mortality. As a result, the number of life insurance policies sold during the first half of 2021 increased 8% compared to last year. This is the highest policy sales growth recorded since 1983, according to LIMRA’s Second Quarter U.S. Individual Life Insurance Sales Survey.  Unfortunately, individuals with serious medical conditions typically don’t qualify for individual life insurance, or the cost of a policy may not be affordable. Given the recent interest in life insurance coverage, this is where group life insurance provided by your employer might be a benefit worth exploring during this fall’s open enrollment period.  Since group life insurance is sponsored by your employer, it’s often a cost-effective way to help protect those who rely on your income. In many cases, it doesn’t require a medical exam for coverage — which is typically cited as a barrier for purchasing life insurance. Additionally, employees can often take their group life insurance policy with them if they leave their employer. They just need to continue paying the insurer directly for the coverage, but it will still be at a cost-effective group rate. Your spouse or kids may also be eligible, which provides another layer of protection for the entire family.  How much life insurance coverage do you need? It’s a personal decision and one that needs to be carefully considered. When calculating the amount of life insurance you want to purchase, one rule of thumb is that your death benefit should equal five to 10 times your annual income. While this is a simple formula, it’s important to remember that it doesn’t consider individual factors, and the financial protection your family may need can change over time — for example, when your children finish school or when you pay off major debt, such as your mortgage. If you need help, there are online calculators that do a great job providing personal guidance, or you can speak with a financial professional.  Tip No. 4: Voluntary benefits are becoming less ‘voluntary’  Typically, when employees prepare for open enrollment, they spend most of their time focused on their core workplace benefits: medical, dental and vision. While these benefits are important, Voya’s customer data shows that more than four in 10 retirement-plan participants (44%) have protection or insurance gaps in their coverage.(2) This could put you in a challenging financial situation if you get hit with an unexpected medical expense. For example, the average cost of one day in the hospital in the U.S. is around $2,400, with the average patient staying more than four days.(3)  Voluntary benefits offered through your employer can provide additional protection, and it’s encouraging to see that employees are now increasingly turning to their employers for solutions. New Voya research shows that the majority of working Americans (75%) want help navigating an unexpected life event, such as a critical illness or accident. Some of the voluntary benefits and services that some employers are offering include hospital indemnity insurance; critical illness insurance coverage; and student loan guidance, refinance and repayment, to name a few.  Employees should not disregard these types of voluntary coverage when selecting their workplace benefits during open enrollment. For example, if you are expecting a baby in the coming year or perhaps are worried about getting COVID-19 and being hospitalized for an extended period, hospital indemnity insurance can help, and typically costs less than what most people expect. Hospital indemnity insurance averages between $250 and $300 per year — that’s less than $1 per day.(4)  Plus, some voluntary benefits can be particularly useful for more than medical bills. Accident insurance, for example, can be used to pay for anything from living expenses — utility bills, pizza delivery or dog walking — to rides to your next doctor’s appointment. When you experience a qualified accident, that benefit payment is yours to spend how you like and need.  Final thoughts  If we look at lessons learned from last year’s open enrollment period, a Voya consumer survey shows that nearly six in 10 American workers (56%) spent more time reviewing the benefits offered by their employer during their open enrollment period. As we enter yet another fall open enrollment season in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, I would strongly encourage everyone to make this time investment once again.  While I realize it might feel like a maze of decisions to navigate, if you get lost, your HR team is there to help guide you and can likely provide links to online tools and resources. Besides, you’ve already taken the important first step to putting yourself on the path to success, and that’s spending time educating yourself.  1) For illustration purposes only.

This design allows for nationally representative estimates at all levels at a point in time and includes the entire age span of enrolled children. The goal of this work is to obtain updated information on EHS programs and understand better how program processes support relationships (e.g., between home visitors and parents, between parents and children, and between teachers and children) that are hypothesized to lead to improved child and family outcomes.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Description: Baby FACES 2018 and 2022 build upon a prior study (Baby FACES 2009; OMB 0970-0354) that longitudinally followed two cohorts of children through their experience in the program. While the 2009 study provided a great deal of information about program participation over time and about services received by children and families, it did not allow for national level estimates of service quality or inferences about children who enter the program after 15 months of age. To fill these knowledge gaps and to answer additional questions about how programs function, the design for the information collection in 2022 will refresh the nationally representative cross- sectional sample of programs, centers, home visitors, teachers, classrooms, children, and families that was used in Baby FACES 2018. Freshening the sample will allow new programs that came into being since 2018 a chance to enter the study. This design allows for nationally representative estimates at all levels at a po"
LIMRA,"Before You Sign Up for Health Insurance at Work, Read This",Kiplinger Personal Finance | Magazines,The Kiplinger Washington Editors,"Rob Grubka  Before You Sign Up for Health Insurance at Work, Read This  It’s open enrollment time at workplaces across the country – for health insurance as well as a bevy of other benefits. Here are four tips to help navigate the maze of benefit decisions.  The fall open enrollment season for employees is upon us, which means millions of American workers will need to make a number of complex decisions when it comes to their benefit selections. In fact, typically the average employee may have to make decisions on over 17 benefits.(1) That’s a lot of decision-making responsibility — especially when you add the stress of trying to protect the financial well-being of your family as the pandemic continues.  Plus, this process will likely not get any easier this fall, as many employers plan to make changes to their benefit line-ups as a result of COVID-19. Therefore, to help navigate the maze of decisions employees will need to make during open enrollment, below are four tips to help maximize your workplace benefits.  Tip No. 1: Don’t be scared off by high-deductible health plans  The two most common types of health plans that employees have access to through their employers are preferred provider organization (PPO) and high-deductible health plans (HDHPs). The PPO option typically has a lower deductible with higher premiums, while the HDHP option typically has higher deductibles with lower premiums and is commonly paired with a tax-advantaged health savings account (HSA) — a powerful savings and spending vehicle.  To help understand why American workers choose the health plans they do during open enrollment, Voya launched a study last fall in partnership with SAVVI Financial. Interestingly, the research reveals employees often have a bias against HDHPs when compared to more traditional PPO health plans. In one part of the study, participants were presented with two different plans and told to think of them as identical in quality of care, access to care and all other features beyond cost. The only differences in the HDHP vs. PPO plans were the premiums and deductibles. Almost two-thirds of study participants (65%) selected the PPO plan — despite the fact that the study was purposefully designed so the HDHP would always be the optimal financial choice. As a result, depending on how much they used their benefits, the average employee was overspending on their health care plan by $500 to $2,500 through the year — which is money a person could be saving for retirement or putting aside for an emergency.  The study identified several reasons why employees are biased against HDHPs, and interestingly the naming of the health plan had a big impact. For example, participants were almost twice as likely to choose a PPO plan over an HDHP when the words “high deductible” were used in the plan name (65% PPO vs. 35% HDHP). This preference noticeably lessens when the plan names are unbranded (53% PPO vs. 47% HDHP).  The bottom line is that when it comes to selecting the best health plan for your family, there’s never a universal, one-size-fits-all solution. Therefore, it’s important to keep an open mind — or you could potentially end up overspending on your health plan.  Tip No. 2: Tap into the power of HSAs  COVID-19 has underscored the need for American workers to be better prepared for health expenses. A health savings account can offer several benefits for both short- and long-term health care savings. For anyone enrolled in a high-deductible health plan, HSAs can help you address immediate health costs as well as the ones you’ll have later in life when you retire.  Faced with a short-term, unexpected need — such as paying for an ER visit — many people might be tempted to dip into their retirement savings. Fortunately, funds in an HSA can double as an emergency savings account for qualified health care expenses. HSAs have the potential to offer triple tax benefits:  Contributions are not taxed.  Investment gains are not taxed.  And withdrawals for qualified medical expenses are not taxed, either.  Plus, when enrolled in a HDHP and HSA, you can choose to leave your funds in your HSA and, instead, cover a medical bill “out of pocket.” This strategy is one way HSAs can serve as a potential emergency savings vehicle for unexpected health care costs in the future. Additionally, since HSA funds roll over each year, many HSAs offer the opportunity to potentially grow your account balance by investing in long-term investment funds, such as stocks.  As a result of these features, HSAs have increased in popularity during the pandemic. Industry research shows that assets in HSAs increased 25% and the number of new HSAs increased 6% in 2020 — which brings the total number of HSAs to approximately 30 million in the U.S. For 2022, the IRS has also increased HSA contribution limits to $3,650 per year for individuals and $7,300 for families. Individuals who are 55 and older are eligible for an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution.  Tip No. 3: Don’t overlook group life insurance  The pandemic has caused many people — both young and old — to reflect on their own mortality. As a result, the number of life insurance policies sold during the first half of 2021 increased 8% compared to last year. This is the highest policy sales growth recorded since 1983, according to LIMRA’s Second Quarter U.S. Individual Life Insurance Sales Survey.  Unfortunately, individuals with serious medical conditions typically don’t qualify for individual life insurance, or the cost of a policy may not be affordable. Given the recent interest in life insurance coverage, this is where group life insurance provided by your employer might be a benefit worth exploring during this fall’s open enrollment period.  Since group life insurance is sponsored by your employer, it’s often a cost-effective way to help protect those who rely on your income. In many cases, it doesn’t require a medical exam for coverage — which is typically cited as a barrier for purchasing life insurance. Additionally, employees can often take their group life insurance policy with them if they leave their employer. They just need to continue paying the insurer directly for the coverage, but it will still be at a cost-effective group rate. Your spouse or kids may also be eligible, which provides another layer of protection for the entire family.  How much life insurance coverage do you need? It’s a personal decision and one that needs to be carefully considered. When calculating the amount of life insurance you want to purchase, one rule of thumb is that your death benefit should equal five to 10 times your annual income. While this is a simple formula, it’s important to remember that it doesn’t consider individual factors, and the financial protection your family may need can change over time — for example, when your children finish school or when you pay off major debt, such as your mortgage. If you need help, there are online calculators that do a great job providing personal guidance, or you can speak with a financial professional.  Tip No. 4: Voluntary benefits are becoming less ‘voluntary’  Typically, when employees prepare for open enrollment, they spend most of their time focused on their core workplace benefits: medical, dental and vision. While these benefits are important, Voya’s customer data shows that more than four in 10 retirement-plan participants (44%) have protection or insurance gaps in their coverage.(2) This could put you in a challenging financial situation if you get hit with an unexpected medical expense. For example, the average cost of one day in the hospital in the U.S. is around $2,400, with the average patient staying more than four days.(3)  Voluntary benefits offered through your employer can provide additional protection, and it’s encouraging to see that employees are now increasingly turning to their employers for solutions. New Voya research shows that the majority of working Americans (75%) want help navigating an unexpected life event, such as a critical illness or accident. Some of the voluntary benefits and services that some employers are offering include hospital indemnity insurance; critical illness insurance coverage; and student loan guidance, refinance and repayment, to name a few.  Employees should not disregard these types of voluntary coverage when selecting their workplace benefits during open enrollment. For example, if you are expecting a baby in the coming year or perhaps are worried about getting COVID-19 and being hospitalized for an extended period, hospital indemnity insurance can help, and typically costs less than what most people expect. Hospital indemnity insurance averages between $250 and $300 per year — that’s less than $1 per day.(4)  Plus, some voluntary benefits can be particularly useful for more than medical bills. Accident insurance, for example, can be used to pay for anything from living expenses — utility bills, pizza delivery or dog walking — to rides to your next doctor’s appointment. When you experience a qualified accident, that benefit payment is yours to spend how you like and need.  Final thoughts  If we look at lessons learned from last year’s open enrollment period, a Voya consumer survey shows that nearly six in 10 American workers (56%) spent more time reviewing the benefits offered by their employer during their open enrollment period. As we enter yet another fall open enrollment season in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, I would strongly encourage everyone to make this time investment once again.  While I realize it might feel like a maze of decisions to navigate, if you get lost, your HR team is there to help guide you and can likely provide links to online tools and resources. Besides, you’ve already taken the important first step to putting yourself on the path to success, and that’s spending time educating yourself.  1) For illustration purposes only.

While I realize it might feel like a maze of decisions to navigate, if you get lost, your HR team is there to help guide you and can likely provide links to online tools and resources. Besides, you’ve already taken the important first step to putting yourself on the path to success, and that’s spending time educating yourself.  1) For illustration purposes only.

Americans with Disabilities Act,The First Circuit Sends an ADA Warning ‎to Employers,JD Supra | Elections & Politics Updates,JD Supra,"The First Circuit Sends an ADA Warning ‎to Employers  On September 15, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit issued a startling and ‎ominous opinion construing the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in a manner which ‎employers should take heed. In a 38-page opinion in the case of Benson v. Wal-Mart Stores East, ‎L.P., the Court addressed a seemingly insignificant controversy by adding twists to the ‎commonly understood proof aspects of the ADA that should send shivers down employers’ ‎spines.‎  Margaret Benson worked for Wal-Mart as a People Greeter, i.e. an employee who welcomed ‎customers, provided “front-end security,” ensured “customer safety in the greeting area,” ‎‎“respond[ed] to electronic surveillance alarms,” and provided direction to customers. Apparently, ‎Ms. Benson suffered a job related injury for which she received workers’ compensation benefits ‎and which, she asserted, resulted in her frequent absences from work for treatment and as a result ‎of adverse reactions to prescribed medications.‎  Wal-Mart terminated her employment due to excessive absences. In most circumstances, ‎unexcused absences or tardiness from work prove sufficient for an employer to terminate an ‎employee. For example, the Appeals Court cited Colon-Fontanez v. Municipality of San Juan, ‎‎660 F.3d, 17, 33 (1st Cir. 2011) for the proposition that “regular attendance ‘is an essential ‎function of any job’ and EEOC v. Ford Motor Co., 783 F.3d 753, 761 (6th Cir. 2016) for the ‎proposition that the ‘general rule - that regularly attending work on-site is essential to most jobs, ‎especially the interactive ones - aligns with the text of the ADA.’‎  Moreover, the Court recognized that to proceed with a case a plaintiff must first establish a ‎prima case of disability discrimination by satisfying several criteria, including that she is ‎‎“qualified, with or without reasonable accommodation, to perform the essential functions of her ‎job. . .” ‎  However, while reciting well-settled concepts of ADA parameters, the Court of Appeals ‎reversed the District Court’s entry of summary judgment for Wal-Mart. So, while one would ‎think that attendance is an “essential” to the job of People Greeter, the Court reasoned that ‎whether a function is essential turns on factors such as (a) whether or not “the written ‎requirements or description of the job” include such a requirement and (b) “the consequences of ‎not requiring the function.” So while the Court, on the one hand, acknowledged it is “not tasked ‎with second guessing an employer’s legitimate business judgment about what is required of its ‎employees,” it indicated, on the other hand, that trial courts should inquire “whether the ‎employer actually enforces this requirement of its employees or merely pays lip service” to it. In ‎other words, the Court was advising lower courts to examine the exact terms of job descriptions ‎and the consequences of absences to ascertain whether attendance is an essential function of a ‎job and whether an employee is seeking a reasonable accommodation for tardiness.‎  The Court recognized that “[t]he ADA requires an employer ‘to make a reasonable ‎accommodation…, unless [the employer] can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose ‎an undue hardship on [its] operation of the business,” Moreover, it viewed Benson’s explanations ‎for her tardiness as a request for a “modified work schedule” and it indicated that Wal-Mart’s ‎‎“own Attendance policy” backfired on it as it “explicitly” considered “any missed time due to a ‎‎‘reasonable accommodation’ to be permitted . . .”‎  Adding more food for thought to the diet of employers in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, ‎Maine, Rhode Island and Puerto Rico, the Court turned to Benson’s retaliation claims and ‎reversed the District Court’s summary judgment on that count as well. In that regard, it relied ‎heavily on the proximity in time for Benson’s internal complaint of harassment and request for a ‎modified schedule and the timing of the termination of her employment. It opined: “On its own, ‎the temporal proximity between the January email [complaining of harassment] and ‎accommodation request and Benson’s February 18 termination is sufficient to make out a prima ‎facie case, but the inference is even stronger alongside [her HR Manager’s] complete inaction in ‎response to Benson’s harassment claim.‎  So what are the lessons of Benson v. Wal-Mart Stores, L. P. when it comes to the ADA? ‎  ‎Make sure job descriptions align with company requirements and personnel decisions.‎  ‎Consider the consequences of what the company deems an “essential function” of an employee’s job.  ‎Review, and amend if appropriate, policies for consistencies and alignment with personnel actions.‎  ‎Do not forget that proximity between a complaint and an employment action can create a treacherous slope.‎  ‎Remember to be vigilant about receiving and responding to complaints of ‎discrimination and/or ‎harassment."

Americans with Disabilities Act,Catholic Vote President: Government Has ‘No Authority’ To Tell Americans ‘What They Can Or Cannot Believe’,The Daily Caller | News,The Daily Caller,"Catholic Vote President: Government Has ‘No Authority’ To Tell Americans ‘What They Can Or Cannot Believe’  'No authority'  Under the Americans with Disabilities Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, U.S. employers may be required to accommodate their employee’s “sincerely held” religious beliefs — including potential religious objections to a vaccine.  Democratic New York Gov. Kathy Hochul told reporters in early September that she was unaware “of a sanctioned religious exemption from any organized religion,” dismissing the idea that healthcare workers could be religiously exempt from the state’s vaccine mandate. (RELATED: CNN Expert Wants Biden Admin To Create ‘Guidelines’ To Weed Out Fake Religious Vaccine Exemptions)  “To the extent that there’s leadership of different religious organizations that have spoken, and they have, I’m not aware of a sanctioned religious exemption from any organized religion,” Hochul said. “In fact, they’re encouraging the opposite. They’re encouraging their members, everybody from the Pope on down, is encouraging people to get vaccinated. So people will say what they choose.”  Burch emphasized that politicians are not moral theologians and have “no business inserting themselves” into the decisions of religious organizations or individuals.  “Catholic Church leaders need to be resolute, and send a clear message that the federal government has no authority to tell the Church what they can or cannot believe,” Burch said. (RELATED: Vaccine Inquisitions? As COVID Vaccination Mandates Increase, Religious Exemptions Come Under Fire)  “In some ways,” he added, “these threats are perfectly consistent with Biden’s record as a Catholic. When the constitutional rights of Catholics and politics come into conflict, government coercion always wins. Just ask the Little Sisters of the Poor.”  The CatholicVote.org president’s comments refer to the Catholic Little Sisters of the Poor and their battle with the Supreme Court to avoid paying for employees’ birth control against their religious beliefs. Multiple figures in the Biden administration, including Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra have stood against the Little Sisters of the Poor.  A Biden administration official told the DCNF Tuesday that protecting religious Americans “will be part of the policy process.” The administration did not immediately respond to requests for further comment.

DOL Conflict of Interest Rule,Foundations Warm to More Impactful Fiduciary Duty,Impactivate | ESG Investing,Impactivate,"Kerby Meyers  Anne Field  James Hester  Tiffany Robertson  Foundations Warm to More Impactful Fiduciary Duty  Amid the ongoing debate over fiduciary duty, foundation trustees and investment committees increasingly see value in impact investing. The post Foundations Warm to More Impactful Fiduciary Duty appeared first on Impactivate.  Fiduciary duty forms the bedrock of overseeing someone else’s money.  Generally extended to members of boards of trustees and directors as well as investment committees and discretionary investment advisors, this responsibility requires that investment decisions are always made in the best interest of the foundation. Anything less is a breach of fiduciary duty, which can lead to serious legal consequences.  For many years, this fiduciary commitment tempered enthusiasm for socially responsible investing (SRI) among foundations. Some held concerns that SRI detracted from financial returns, particularly if an investment portfolio excluded certain companies or even industries such as tobacco, gambling, or fossil fuels. The resulting performance deviations from this investment approach could be perceived as a failure to meet fiduciary obligations.  Yet as the foundation community grows to understand the potential ripple effects of mission-aligned investments, the tide has begun turning toward a wider acceptance of investments that generate results broader than the bottom line.  The evolution of data availability positions investors to tilt toward companies with relatively responsible environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices without actively excluding others from a portfolio. This notion of positive screening has been shown to produce relatively competitive performance as well as support ESG efforts.  Fiduciary Duty for Foundations  At the core of every foundation, there is an endowment that allows the organization to fulfill its vision and mission through grants to worthy recipients such as nonprofits and nongovernmental organizations.  Internal Revenue Service guidelines dictate that private foundations distribute 5% of their assets every year. In order to support their vision and mission, most organizations enlist professional investment managers to grow the remaining 95% and maintain the viability of the foundation.  Fiduciary duties require acting in good faith and in ways that a prudent and rational individual would act. These duties are defined by two legal doctrines: the Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act and the Uniform Prudent Investor Act. The acts also allow for a number of outside factors that could affect an investment’s return, including inflationary and deflationary impacts, tax implications, the broader economic landscape, and the relationship to the foundation’s vision and mission.  Ultimately, holding a foundation’s investment committee and board of trustees to the fiduciary standard allows the organization to keep making grants, anticipate potential capital needs, and cover core functions such as operational, marketing, and fundraising expenses.  Emerging Legal Perspectives  The shift in thinking on performance also stems in part from the active back-and-forth over ESG investing’s place in the fiduciary standard. In the 2020 Fiduciary Duty in the 21st Century, the Principles for Responsible Investment and UN Environment Programme Finance Initiative declared that investors must incorporate ESG issues into their investment analysis and decision-making processes. The authors supported their conclusion by citing the emergence of ESG analysis as a standard, the financial materiality of ESG factors, and policy and regulatory shifts.  Meanwhile, a Stanford Law Review article published in February 2020 concluded that ESG investing does not violate US trust law as long as trustees see the approach as improving risk-adjusted investment returns. The article also states that enhanced return potential is the sole rationale for ESG integration. Although this thinking allows some latitude, it stops short of agreeing that ESG analysis should be mandatory.  Conversely, a University of Colorado Law Review article published less than a year earlier contended that the evolution of the standard of prudence increasingly allows for the use of information traditionally ignored by investors. Therefore, ESG analysis should be a piece of the fiduciary standard.  Notwithstanding the legal wrangling, the Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment reported in its 2020 US SIF Trends Report that 126 foundations incorporated ESG factors into their investment decisions on $97 billion worth of assets. This is a 43% increase above the level reported two years prior.  Although the debate over fiduciary duties will undoubtedly continue, the growing awareness of the beneficial outcomes of impact investing could render the discussion moot for many foundations and inspire wider adoption."
Regulation Best Interest,"SEC, Finra officials: Don’t just go through motions on Reg BI compliance",InvestmentNews | Most Recent,InvestmentNews,"Mark Schoeff Jr.  SEC, Finra officials: Don’t just go through motions on Reg BI compliance  Regulators said brokerages should not only tell reps what Reg BI says but provide examples of how to meet its requirements.  Regulators said brokerages should not only tell reps what Reg BI says but provide examples of how to meet its requirements.  September 22, 2021  By Mark Schoeff Jr.  Financial firms that are failing to comply with the broker standard of conduct aren’t aligning their internal controls to meet its requirements, securities regulators said Wednesday.  Now that Regulation Best Interest has been in force for more than a year, examiners have had a chance to assess how brokerages are adhering to the measure, which prohibits brokers from putting their financial interests ahead of their retail customers’ interests when they’re making recommendations about securities or investment strategies.  Under the rule, firms must establish policies and procedures to identify and disclose conflicts of interest and, in some cases, mitigate or eliminate them. The Securities and Exchange Commission said Reg BI, as it’s known, was designed to be a tougher bar for brokers to meet than the previous suitability standard.  But some firms have not modified their compliance processes to reflect the new rule’s mandates.  “We had some firms just take the word ‘suitability’ and replace it with ‘best interest’ in their written supervisory procedures — not really understanding the new requirements that have come into effect with the rule,” Nicole McCafferty, examinations director at the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority Inc., said during an online panel at the Insured Retirement Institute’s annual conference.  For the first few months after Reg BI was implemented on June 30, 2020, examiners from the SEC and Finra evaluated whether firms were acting in “good faith” to comply. Since the beginning of this year, the exams have become more detailed and comprehensive.  “We’ve really been able to take a broader approach as to what firms have actually done,” McCafferty said.  The SEC is looking at whether financial firms have established a Reg BI compliance program that reflects the characteristics of their practices.  “Firms need to take a considered and thoughtful approach that tailors their policies and procedures to meet the unique circumstances of the firm and its products,” said Corey Schuster, director of enforcement in the SEC’s asset management unit. “I think it’s important to give registered representatives guidance on not just what Reg BI says but specific examples of how to accomplish its requirements.”  Schuster also recommended that firms reflect on the products they sell and how they sell them.  “And firms may want to consider: Have you done a deep dive on conflicts?” he said. “Have you examined your disclosures regarding conflicts? And is there a need to mitigate certain conflicts of interest?”  One of the major differences between Reg BI and suitability is that under Reg BI, registered representatives must consider reasonably available alternatives and their costs compared to the recommendations they make to customers, said Mark Quinn, director of regulatory affairs at Cetera Financial Group.  “We think of it as a product knowledge requirement,” Quinn said.  Generally, McCafferty seemed pleased by the brokerage industry’s response to the relatively new standard of conduct.  “We have found that firms have really taken [Reg BI] seriously,” she said.  Best compliance practices include identifying and mitigating conflicts — either through a matrix or a conflicts committee; aligning sales of complex products with customers with appropriate risk tolerance; and obtaining sufficient information about customers to guide recommendations on account types, securities and investment strategies."
DOL Conflict of Interest Rule,Companies Want More Time to Implement Fiduciary Exemption Rule,Bloomberg Law | Benefits & Executive Compensation | In Brief,Bloomberg Law,"Austin R. Ramsey  Companies Want More Time to Implement Fiduciary Exemption Rule  Financial services companies have asked the U.S. Department of Labor for more time to implement a new rule, set to take effect in December, that would allow them to profit from one-time retirement plan rollover advice.  The Trump-era rule sets a “best interest” benchmark for investment advice—a lesser standard of responsibility than strict fiduciary measures. It defines a fiduciary by using a five-part test dating to 1975 that would allow advisers to profit from client advice to roll over assets from a federally protected retirement plan into an individual retirement account or state-regulated annuity.  Several U.S. trade organizations, including the ..."
DOL Conflict of Interest Rule,Advocacy Groups Seeks More Time Implementing DOL Fiduciary Rule,WealthManagement | Regulation & Compliance,WealthManagement,"Patrick Donachie  Advocacy Groups Seeks More Time Implementing DOL Fiduciary Rule  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, SIFMA and other trade groups argue that the temporary enforcement guidance scheduled to end Dec. 20 should be extended for six to 12 months. A number of trade groups, including the Insured Retirement Institute and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, are urging the the Labor Department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration to extend temporary enforcement guidance that has been in place since the department’s fiduciary exemption rule went into effect in February, in order to prepare for the new rule. In the letter to Ali S. Khawar, the acting assistant secretary for EBSA, the groups asked the agency to extend the temporary enforcement policy by six to 12 months past its current end date of Dec. 20, 2021. “EBSA and all stakeholders would benefit from such an extension, as it would allow firms to thoughtfully consider using Prohibited Transaction Exemption 2020-02 and implement it most effectively, while reducing consumer confusion and disruption that would follow from retaining the current date,” the letter read. The rule, entitled “Improving Investment Advices for Workers and Retirees Exemption,” was intended to align the DOL’s fiduciary conduct rules with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation Best Interest. It allows fiduciaries to partially receive compensation from third parties when recommending certain investments in retirement plans and IRAs, provided they adhere to certain “impartial conduct standards.” The rule was first proposed during summer 2020, and was finalized in the waning weeks of the Trump administration. When Joe Biden took office in January, it was uncertain whether the rule would go into effect, as it was particularly vulnerable to delay by coming so late in Trump’s tenure. Some consumer advocates urged the Biden administration to delay its effective date. Nevertheless, on Feb. 12, the Labor Department announced the rule would go into effect as scheduled several days later. But the DOL allowed temporary enforcement guidance enacted after the Obama administration’s fiduciary rule was vacated in federal court in 2018 to continue until Dec. 20 of this year. The temporary policy states the DOL will not pursue enforcement of the rule if fiduciaries are working ""diligently and in good faith"" to comply with the impartial conduct standards. Other signees to the letter to EBSA besides the IRI and SIFMA include the National Association for Insurance and Financial Advisors, the National Association of Independent Life Brokerage Agencies and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. In the letter, they argued EBSA should allow the current rules as written should go into effect and have a period of review and evaluation before any further changes are made. In an interview with WealthManagement.com, Jason Berkowitz, the IRI’s chief legal and regulatory affairs officer, said it was “inappropriate” to end the temporary enforcement guidance while simultaneously considering changes to the fiduciary rule (the DOL plans to issue a notice of rulemaking on changing the rule in December, according to the American Society of Pension Professionals and Actuaries). Based on prior statements and a preamble included in the rule’s final proposal, Berkowitz believed the DOL might try to broaden the definition of who should be included as a fiduciary, and he worried that additional provisions to the exemptions could be “incompatible” with how the industry operates. “Let’s see if further rulemaking is needed,” he said. “If they’re not willing to hold off on that, they should extend this temporary enforcement policy until they complete that work.” The letter’s signees argued the potential for changes to the rule is leading firms to not amend their own policies, calling the current rule a “moving target” in which procedures developed today to comply with the rule might not suffice after it’s revised. The IRI and others also worried that smaller firms were less aware of the Dec. 20 expiration of the temporary policy. While larger firms have been preparing for compliance for months, smaller firms might not have the resources to keep pace. “The resource disadvantages small firms face may prohibit them from being able to comply on Dec. 20, potentially leaving them with no choice but to reject fiduciary status,” the letter read. “This could potentially create an unlevel playing field between retirement investors who utilize large firms versus small firms as their advisors.” Berkowitz was particularly concerned about the industry’s compliance with a requirement in the exemption demanding that advisors provide a comparison when recommending a rollover from a client’s current account. According to Berkowitz, if a client had a 401(k) and their advisor recommended an IRA rollover, the advisor would need to be able to show the differences between the two options. But Berkowitz argued that 401(k) disclosure statements aren’t always accessible, and even if advisors access that information, firms would need a technology solution to comply. “Otherwise, you’re going to end up with a lot of back-of-the-napkin, ‘hey, let me sketch this out for you and here’s what it looks like,’ but it won’t be consistent,” he said. “There won’t be as much ability for oversight within the supervisory structure to ensure that information is being presented accurately and appropriately.""

But the DOL allowed temporary enforcement guidance enacted after the Obama administration’s fiduciary rule was vacated in federal court in 2018 to continue until Dec. 20 of this year.  The temporary policy states the DOL will not pursue enforcement of the rule if fiduciaries are working ""diligently and in good faith"" to comply with the impartial conduct standards.  Other signees to the letter to EBSA besides the IRI and SIFMA include the National Association for Insurance and Financial Advisors, the National Association of Independent Life Brokerage Agencies and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.  In the letter, they argued EBSA should allow the current rules as written should go into effect and have a period of review and evaluation before any further changes are made. In an interview with WealthManagement.com, Jason Berkowitz, the IRI’s chief legal and regulatory affairs officer, said it was “inappropriate” to end the temporary enforcement guidance while simultaneously considering changes to the fiduciary rule (the DOL plans to issue a notice of rulemaking on changing the rule in December, according to the American Society of Pension Professionals and Actuaries).  Based on prior statements and a preamble included in the rule’s final proposal, Berkowitz believed the DOL might try to broaden the definition of who should be included as a fiduciary, and he worried that additional provisions to the exemptions could be “incompatible” with how the industry operates.  “Let’s see if further rulemaking is needed,” he said. “If they’re not willing to hold off on that, they should extend this temporary enforcement policy until they complete that work.”  The letter’s signees argued the potential for changes to the rule is leading firms to not amend their own policies, calling the current rule a “moving target” in which procedures developed today to comply with the rule might not suffice after it’s revised. The IRI and others also worried that smaller firms were less aware of the Dec. 20 expiration of the temporary policy. While larger firms have been preparing for compliance for months, smaller firms might not have the resources to keep pace.  “The resource disadvantages small firms face may prohibit them from being able to comply on Dec. 20, potentially leaving them with no choice but to reject fiduciary status,” the letter read. “This could potentially create an unlevel playing field between retirement investors who utilize large firms versus small firms as their advisors.”  Berkowitz was particularly concerned about the industry’s compliance with a requirement in the exemption demanding that advisors provide a comparison when recommending a rollover from a client’s current account. According to Berkowitz, if a client had a 401(k) and their advisor recommended an IRA rollover, the advisor would need to be able to show the differences between the two options. But Berkowitz argued that 401(k) disclosure statements aren’t always accessible, and even if advisors access that information, firms would need a technology solution to comply.  “Otherwise, you’re going to end up with a lot of back-of-the-napkin, ‘hey, let me sketch this out for you and here’s what it looks like,’ but it won’t be consistent,” he said. “There won’t be as much ability for oversight within the supervisory structure to ensure that information is being presented accurately and appropriately."""
Standard Instructions for Filing Forms Under the '33 Act and the '34 Act,ESG credentials driving value for miners on US exchanges,JD Supra | Coronavirus/COVID-19,JD Supra,"ESG credentials driving value for miners on US exchanges  Investors are returning to mining & metals amid an almost unprecedented rally in the US capital markets that is taking place despite the continued economic challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic  45.5%  The Nasdaq has increased by 45.5% from January 2020 to January 2021 while TSX and ASX saw modest increases and LSE had a decrease in capitalization of 8.8%  Those companies that have repositioned themselves as part of the energy transition away from fossil fuels have been able to take advantage of this momentum and find favor among generalist investors in the US.  But the sector is also facing intense scrutiny over its ability to meet increasing environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards. It is far from alone in facing this scrutiny, with other sectors such as energy also under the public eye in relation to ESG issues. The UN Climate Change Conference set to take place in Glasgow in November 2021 will shine an even greater light on these issues.  It is clear that the mining & metals industry must play an important role in energy transition, both in terms of improving its own environmental footprint, but also in being a necessary contributor to the commodities needed to usher in a clean energy future.  The mining & metals industry is not homogenous. It consists of several subsectors, each with their own economic drivers.  Precious metals, industrial metals, construction materials and energy materials each follow diverging commodities cycles. While all miners must focus on ESG compliance, some commodity producers will benefit more than others as the economy turns its attention to an energy transition.  The interest in clean energy and decarbonization of the economy presents an opportunity for those operators producing commodities that are integral to the energy transition. Battery minerals such as lithium, nickel, cobalt and graphite are expected to see a marked increase in demand that many forecast will outstrip current supply.  Mining & metals industry has a key role to play in global energy transition, both in improving its own environmental footprint and by contributing commodities needed for a cleaner energy future  The shift to the US  Traditionally, mining companies have commonly found their home on one of three exchanges, in markets that have mining as a core component of the national economy: the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) and TSX Venture Exchange in Canada; the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX); and the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) in South Africa.  To an extent, the London Stock Exchange (LSE) has been the international market of choice outside of these three jurisdictions.  According to a comparison of overall domestic market capitalization from January 2020 and January 2021, the TSX and similar Canadian exchanges run by the TMX Group experienced an increase of 4.9 percent. The ASX saw more modest growth of 1.9 percent and the LSE Group had a decrease in capitalization of 8.8 percent.  However, the Nasdaq has increased by 45.5 percent during that time. Traditionally technology focused, the Nasdaq has seen some of the highest growth and influx of capital of stock markets in developed countries in recent years.  There is a great opportunity for miners with the right credentials to capitalize on this moment. Companies producing commodities that are integral to an energy transition and which can demonstrate ESG compliance are finding favor with US investors, and mining & metals companies are starting to gravitate to the US markets as a result, as the graph shows.  The data does not include the second half of 2021, and the first half of 2020 was affected by the pandemic. That just emphasizes the scale of the growth in new listings by mining & metals companies in the past two years.  View full image: Mining & metals companies new listings on US exchanges, 2014 – 2021 (PDF)  US$12 billion  To date, SPACs with a mining or energy transition focus have generated, or are expected to generate, nearly US$12 billion from 50 separate initial public offerings  Rule changes facilitating moves  Mining-focused companies are taking advantage of the strength and depth of the US capital markets and the large amount of capital that companies listed on US exchanges have access to. A significant number of these companies have positioned themselves as suppliers to industries that are seen as pivotal to an energy transition, such as electric vehicle manufacturers, battery producers and the renewables sector.  Recent changes to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) disclosure rules for companies engaged in mining operations have also helped to facilitate these moves.  In late 2018, the SEC overhauled the relevant disclosure requirements by replacing its decades-old guidelines, set out in Industry Guide 7, with new subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K, based on the Committee for Mineral Reserves International Reporting Standards (CRIRSCO).  The new rules are mandatory for companies for their first fiscal year beginning on or after January 1, 2021. While the rules create a path to disclosure of resources and reserves for companies listing in the US, differences between the SEC rules and those in other jurisdictions based on CRIRSCO mean companies that have historically reported in jurisdictions such as Australia or South Africa will likely have to undertake a substantive update of their technical reports.  An exception to this exists in the form of the Canada-US Multijurisdictional Disclosure System (MJDS). The MJDS gives companies that are already listed and reporting on the TSX (or TSX-V) a more streamlined path to listing in the US.  Battery minerals companies have been leading the way, making the shift to the US. Canada’s Nouveau Monde Graphite, which has traditionally traded on the TSX Venture Exchange, has recently dual-listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Australian Piedmont Lithium, which has raised multiple rounds of capital through the use of American Deposit Receipts (ADRs) on the Nasdaq Capital Market, are two good examples.  In addition to traditional mining companies, special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) with a mining focus have also been able to generate capital from the US capital markets to an unprecedented degree. To date, SPACs with a mining or energy transition focus have generated, or are expected to generate, nearly US$12 billion from 50 separate initial public offerings.  Newcomers to the essential mining industry are now taking advantage of different avenues to capital that until now were untapped.  The US capital markets are the largest source of capital in the world for publicly traded companies, and mining & metals companies are in the perfect position to take advantage of these sources of capital, as long as they shape their messaging around ESG and what investors are looking for.

SAFE Banking Act,SAFE Banking Act would ease cannabis industry's financial restrictions,Crain's New York | Politics,Crain's New York Business,"SAFE Banking Act would ease cannabis industry's financial restrictions  U.S. House approved the legislation late Tuesday by voice vote To view the full story, click the title link.  The U.S. House of Representatives will vote this week on a bill that would let banks do business with cannabis companies without fear of penalty.  The so-called SAFE Banking Act, which is the least disputed reform sought by the growing industry, got picked up as part of broader legislation, and its inclusion in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) was approved by voice vote late Tuesday. It remains to be seen whether the bill will pass the Senate, but the House action gives it a better shot.  The act would be a boon for marijuana companies, which have so far been stymied by the need to deal in cash because of federal restrictions. That has meant they have extra security costs and logistical problems, even as marijuana increasingly becomes legal. Some three dozen states now allow medical or recreational use, according to New Frontier Data, a cannabis research firm.  Representative Ed Perlmutter, a Colorado Democrat, who had re-introduced the bill, has said that allowing cannabis businesses to access the banking system would bring more money into the economy and offer the opportunity to create good-paying jobs. The American cannabis industry had $20.3 billion in legal sales in 2020, according New Frontier Data.  Perlmutter is a proponent of adding the SAFE Act to the NDAA, according to Green Market Report.  The initiative, which has been passed by the House before with bipartisan support but never advanced to the Senate, is still a far cry from the wish list of legal reforms sought by the industry, which include all-out legalization and relief from tax burdens.  The U.S. Cannabis Council, a trade group, called the current rules that require marijuana firms to be all-cash a security hazard.  “Over $17 billion in legal cannabis was sold in the United States last year, overwhelmingly through cash transactions. Forcing legitimate, well-regulated cannabis businesses to conduct most of their business in cash is anachronistic and a clear threat to public safety,” the council’s chief executive officer, Steven Hawkins, said in a statement before the bill passed.

He said it isn’t clear whether Senator Chuck Schumer will include the act in the Senate NDAA bill.  “Discussions with our D.C. contacts suggest it has an easier pathway of getting through the Senate, largely because no senator wants to be viewed as holding up the massive 1,700 page must-pass NDAA simply because of SAFE banking,” Lyon wrote."

Regulating Market Activity During a Public Offering,CVB Financial Corp. Announces Termination of its 10b5-1 Stock Repurchase Program,Yahoo! News | Business,Yahoo! News,"CVB Financial Corp. Announces Termination of its 10b5-1 Stock Repurchase Program  ONTARIO, Calif., Sept. 23, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CVB Financial Corp. (NASDAQ: CVBF) (the “Company”) announced today that effective immediately it has terminated its 10b5-1 stock repurchase program in order to comply with Regulation M under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The termination is related to the announced acquisition by the Company and its principal subsidiary, Citizens Business Bank, of Suncrest Bank. Suncrest Bank will be engaged in a proxy solicitation associated with the prospective issuance of the Company’s common stock in connection with the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization and Merger among the Company, its principal subsidiary, Citizens Business Bank and Suncrest Bank, dated July 27, 2021, which in turn caused Regulation M to become applicable to any repurchases by the Company of its common stock. The Company’s Board of Directors previously authorized the Company to repurchase up to 10,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. During the third quarter of 2021, the Company repurchased 390,336 shares of common stock, at an average price of $18.97, and as of September 23, 2021, 4,194,809 shares remain available for repurchase.

Federal Insurance Contributions Act,Gen Z: Why Your Take-Home Pay Is Not Your Base Pay GOBankingRates,MSN Money | Personal Finance,MSN,"Gen Z: Why Your Take-Home Pay Is Not Your Base Pay GOBankingRates  Stimulus Update: States Give Out Thousands of Bonus $1,000 Checks – Will You Get One?  Gross Pay Is What You Earn, Net Pay Is What You Keep  Let’s say for the sake of round numbers that you landed a job that pays $52,000 a year. That’s $1,000 a week — hardly too shabby for your first real job, congrats. Presuming bi-monthly pay periods, that’s $2,000 per paycheck. But before you go spending all that cash in your mind just yet, be prepared, that is not the amount of money you’ll actually be taking home every 14 days.  Their Impact on Money: Gen Z: The Future of Finances  That’s your gross pay, which is sometimes called base pay, although base pay usually refers to salary before tips or bonuses. No matter the name, it’s the nice, big number you see printed on your check before several withholdings shrink it down. What’s left after that is called your net pay. That’s what you actually take home, which is why net pay is commonly called take-home pay.  Withholdings can whittle that $2,000 gross pay down by hundreds of dollars. So, who is nibbling at your salary before it ever even gets to you and where is it all going?  Find Out: How Much Money Gen Z Makes in Every State  Federal Income Tax  Your federal income tax withholdings vary depending on factors like your tax bracket, your filing status (married, single, head of household, etc.) and your number of withholding allowances. The fewer allowances you claim, the more money will be withheld from your paycheck and the smaller your take-home pay will be.  By default, your employer will usually withhold more than is necessary to cover your taxes. In those cases, you’ll get a tax refund at the end of the year, which many people like and look forward to. Others claim additional allowances to keep a bigger chunk of each paycheck. But if you claim too many allowances and withhold too little of your check, the IRS might hit you with a tax bill come April 15.  Related: 10 Most Promising Careers for Gen Z Workers  State Income Tax  Eight states don’t tax individual income, but the rest do, according to the Tax Foundation. Most states levy taxes on a graduated basis, but nine states tax everyone’s total taxable income at a single rate. Depending on where you live, state taxes can take a big bite out of your take-home pay. At a bruising 13.3%, California is the highest of all for top earners, but New Jersey is also in double digits. Minnesota, Oregon and Washington, D.C., are not far behind.  The Financial Guide to Adulting: Real Money Advice From Older Generations  FICA Taxes  Both you and your employer contribute equally to Social Security and Medicare through payroll taxes as required by the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA). You cannot opt out of FICA contributions, which your employer withholds on your behalf for the government.  For 2021, the Social Security tax rate is 6.2% for both the employer and employee, and the Medicare tax rate is 1.45% for each as well, although high earners pay extra for Medicare. If you earn $50,000, you’ll pay $3,825 this year in FICA taxes. Your employer will pay the same. If you’re self-employed, you have to pay as both the employee and the employer — 12.4% for Social Security and 4.9% for Medicare — in a double-whammy that’s known as the self-employment tax.  Employee Benefits  It’s not just taxes. A portion of your wages might be withheld as part of your benefits package, too. For example, 401(k) contributions are pulled directly from your paycheck whether your employer matches or not. Also, you might have money withheld from your check to cover your share of a medical insurance plan."
Fair Housing Act,"Homebuyer âlove lettersâ risk fair housing violations, but some feel risk is worth it",Arizona Daily Star | Recent News,The Arizona Daily Star,"Homebuyer âlove lettersâ risk fair housing violations, but some feel risk is worth it  “I could picture the Christmas tree, where it would go and my kids coming down the stairs Christmas morning,” she said. “I love to cook and so I pictured myself making these family dinners. And I just really visualized ourselves in this home and kind of tried to express those feelings.”  A photo of the Saco family accompanied the letter.  “Buyer love letters are a tactic used by some buyers in an attempt to stand out to a seller, especially in hot markets with low inventory and bidding wars,” the National Association of Realtors said on its website in October. “Seemingly harmless, these letters actually raise fair housing concerns, and could open real estate professionals and their clients to fair housing violations.”  “They often contain personal information and reveal characteristics of the buyer, such as race, religion, or familial status, which could then be used, knowingly or through unconscious bias, as an unlawful basis for a seller’s decision to accept or reject an offer.”  The federal Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination against both homebuyers and renters based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status or disability.  Even seemingly innocuous details can risk running afoul of fair housing standards.  Describing children coming down the stairs on Christmas morning, for instance, “not only reveals the potential buyer’s familial status, but also their religion, both of which are protected characteristics,” the Realtors association said.  To avert the potential for infractions, Oregon passed a law in June requiring sellers’ agents to “reject any communication other than customary documents in a real estate transaction, including photographs, provided by a buyer.” It’s the first state in the country to enact such legislation.  Jay Young, executive director of the Southwest Fair Housing Council, said he doesn’t expect Arizona to follow suit anytime soon.  “I think a law like that would not have a lot of chance of success in Arizona,” Young said. “I don’t think the political climate is such that the state Legislature would move to outlaw the practice.”  However, the Fair Housing Act applies across the country. Young said sellers who violate that law by choosing a buyer based on “protected characteristics” risk facing a lawsuit.  A complaint also could be filed with the federal government against the violator, which could result in monetary damages, he said.  But so far, claims of discrimination in Arizona based on buyer love letters appear to be rare, if they happen at all.  “I have personally not heard of any claims or lawsuits arising out of a buyer’s love letter to a seller,” said Michelle Lind, CEO of the Arizona Association of Realtors.  And the extent to which these letters actually result in discrimination is unclear.  “I think it’s one of those things that is really hard to prove,” Young said. “But what we do know is that racism and discrimination has been part of our housing market really forever, and there’s still ample evidence that it’s happening today.”  For instance, a three-year investigation by Newsday published in late 2019 found widespread evidence of discriminatory practices among Long Island, New York, real estate agents.  “I don’t know with 100% certainty, but I think they gave us more of a chance to come in higher because of the letter,” he said. “In a weird way, maybe they were rooting for us to get the home now that they understood our character and how we fit into the community.”  The strong sense of community in their new neighborhood was part of the home’s appeal to the Sacos. They also believe the sellers felt a responsibility to help maintain that community feel even after they left.  “Everyone on our street has grown really close,” Nadia Saco said. “And so I think they take it very seriously when a new family moves in that it’ll be a good fit for the street.”  Including a love letter doesn’t always ensure a successful bid, however. The Sacos put offers on two other houses before finally landing their new home, and one of those offers also included a letter, they said. And it hasn’t always worked for Ernest Saco’s clients, either.  Still, he encourages homebuyers to do whatever it takes to land the home of their dreams.  “Typically, my clients will ask me if they should write a letter,” he said. “My advice to them is usually, anything you can do to attempt to make your offer seem more valuable, I’d advise doing that. Especially if it’s a bidding war.”  When he represents sellers, though, he strikes a somewhat different tune.  “My advice to my sellers is always take the emotion out of it and keep it strictly financial,” he said. “Whatever seems to be the strongest offer with the least amount of risk is what’s in your best interest, and move forward with that.”  But sometimes that emotion still comes into play for his sellers.  One of Ernest Saco’s recent clients chose an offer that was “on par with the other top offers,” but also included a letter that described the buyer’s “life journey.” As the seller had a similar “life journey” of his own, he gave the buyer a chance to raise his offer, Ernest Saco said.  “It did help that person in that situation,” he said.  And he thinks that, ultimately, homebuyers should be able to express their hopes and share their stories with sellers.  “Our home is more than just wood and stucco. It’s where we’re raising our family. It’s where we’re spending the majority of our time,” Ernest Saco said.  “Having a way to show someone that your home will be in good hands, the home that you spent living your life in, I think is a positive thing – if biases can be removed and discrimination can be removed,” he said."
Federal Insurance Contributions Act,Internal Revenue Bulletin: 2021-39,IRS | IRS Online Bulletins,Internal Revenue Service (IRS),"Internal Revenue Bulletin: 2021-39  The Internal Revenue Bulletin is the authoritative instrument of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue for announcing official rulings and procedures of the Internal Revenue Service and for publishing Treasury Decisions, Executive Orders, Tax Conventions, legislation, court decisions, and other items of general interest. It is published weekly.  It is the policy of the Service to publish in the Bulletin all substantive rulings necessary to promote a uniform application of the tax laws, including all rulings that supersede, revoke, modify, or amend any of those previously published in the Bulletin. All published rulings apply retroactively unless otherwise indicated. Procedures relating solely to matters of internal management are not published; however, statements of internal practices and procedures that affect the rights and duties of taxpayers are published.  Revenue rulings represent the conclusions of the Service on the application of the law to the pivotal facts stated in the revenue ruling. In those based on positions taken in rulings to taxpayers or technical advice to Service field offices, identifying details and information of a confidential nature are deleted to prevent unwarranted invasions of privacy and to comply with statutory requirements.  Rulings and procedures reported in the Bulletin do not have the force and effect of Treasury Department Regulations, but they may be used as precedents. Unpublished rulings will not be relied on, used, or cited as precedents by Service personnel in the disposition of other cases. In applying published rulings and procedures, the effect of subsequent legislation, regulations, court decisions, rulings, and procedures must be considered, and Service personnel and others concerned are cautioned against reaching the same conclusions in other cases unless the facts and circumstances are substantially the same.  The Bulletin is divided into four parts as follows:  Part I.—1986 Code. This part includes rulings and decisions based on provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.  Part II.—Treaties and Tax Legislation. This part is divided into two subparts as follows: Subpart A, Tax Conventions and Other Related Items, and Subpart B, Legislation and Related Committee Reports.  Part III.—Administrative, Procedural, and Miscellaneous. To the extent practicable, pertinent cross references to these subjects are contained in the other Parts and Subparts. Also included in this part are Bank Secrecy Act Administrative Rulings. Bank Secrecy Act Administrative Rulings are issued by the Department of the Treasury’s Office of the Assistant Secretary (Enforcement).  Part IV.—Items of General Interest. This part includes notices of proposed rulemakings, disbarment and suspension lists, and announcements.  The last Bulletin for each month includes a cumulative index for the matters published during the preceding months. These monthly indexes are cumulated on a semiannual basis, and are published in the last Bulletin of each semiannual period.  No public hearing was requested or held regarding the proposed regulations. Two responsive comments were received, both of which concerned only one portion of the proposed regulations – proposed §301.7602-1(b)(3)(C), titled “Hiring of certain non-government attorneys.”  The first commenter recommended modifying the proposed rules to allow any outside contractors working for the IRS to examine, interview, and determine whether a taxpayer was a “tax cheat.” The Department of the Treasury (Treasury Department) and the IRS decline to adopt this comment. While the IRS may hire a contractor to assist the IRS in these processes, examining a taxpayer and determining whether that taxpayer is in compliance with Federal tax laws are core IRS functions that the IRS has never allowed a contractor to perform. In addition, section 7602(f) now prohibits the IRS from allowing an IRS contractor to ask substantive questions of a witness whose testimony is being taken under oath pursuant to section 7602.  The second commenter noted that the non-exclusive nature of the proposed regulations left open the possibility that the IRS could hire as a contractor in an IRS examination a certified public accountant (CPA), enrolled agent, or another non-attorney to provide the IRS with assistance in the application of Federal tax laws. This commenter asserted that the proposed regulations should be revised so as to prohibit the IRS from hiring as a contractor in an examination any person, whether or not an attorney, for that person’s expertise with the Federal tax laws. The Treasury Department and the IRS decline to adopt this comment. The limitation on hiring attorneys as contactors in examinations for their expertise in applying the Federal tax laws is a measure that goes beyond what is required by section 7602(f). This hiring limitation was introduced as a matter of sound tax administration to address concerns expressed by a range of professional and business associations over the IRS’s prior use of attorneys as contractors. While the previous commenters addressing the Summons Interview Regulations and Notice 2017-38, 2017-30 I.R.B. 147, noted the potential hazards that could arise from the IRS hiring attorney contractors for their expertise with Federal tax laws, the hiring of a CPA or other accountant by the IRS as a contractor has not been established as a widely held concern. Accordingly, the Treasury Department and the IRS have determined (1) that hiring outside CPAs and accountants as contractors in an examination does not pose the same potential risk to tax administration that prior commenters had identified for the IRS hiring of outside attorneys, who are trained at developing facts and taking testimony, and (2) that the IRS is justified in contracting for the resources and expertise of CPAs and accountants from outside of the IRS in certain large or complex cases.  Accordingly, 26 CFR part 301 is amended as follows:  PART 301—PROCEDURE AND ADMINISTRATION  Paragraph 1. The general authority citation for part 301 continues to read in part as follows:  Authority: 26 U.S.C. 7805 * * *  Par. 2. Section 301.7602-1 is amended:  1. In paragraph (b)(2), by adding “(Secretary)” at the end of the first sentence.  2. By revising paragraphs (b)(3) and (d).  The revisions read as follows:  § 301.7602-1 Examination of books and witnesses.  * * * * *  (b)* * *  (3) Participation of a person described in section 6103(n)—(i) IRS contractor access to books and records obtained by the IRS administratively—(A) In general. The Secretary may not, under the authority of section 6103(n), provide any books, papers, records, or other data obtained pursuant to section 7602 to any person authorized under section 6103(n), except when such person requires such information for the sole purpose of providing expert evaluation and assistance to the IRS.  (B) Persons providing expert evaluation and assistance. For the purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section, persons providing expert evaluation and assistance may include, but are not limited to, the following:  (1) Persons with specialized expertise in certain substantive areas, including, but not limited to, economists, engineers, attorneys specializing in an area relevant to an issue in the examination (such as patent law, property law, environmental law, or foreign, state, or local law (including foreign, state, or local tax law)), industry experts, or other subject-matter experts;  (2) Persons providing support as ancillary service contractors including, but not limited to, court reporters, translators or interpreters, photocopy services, providers of data processing programs or equipment, litigation support services, or other similar contractors; and  (3) Whistleblower-related contractors described in § 301.6103(n)-2.  (C) Hiring of certain non-government attorneys. The IRS may not hire an attorney as a contractor to assist in an examination under section 7602 unless the attorney is hired by the IRS as a specialist in foreign, state, or local law (including foreign, state, or local tax law), or in non-tax substantive law that is relevant to an issue in the examination, such as patent law, property law, or environmental law, or is hired for knowledge, skills, or abilities other than providing legal services as an attorney.  (ii) IRS contractor participation in an IRS summons interview—(A) In general. No person other than an officer or employee of the IRS or its Office of Chief Counsel may, on behalf of the Secretary, question a witness under oath whose testimony was obtained pursuant to section 7602. Persons authorized by section 6103(n) and with whom the Secretary may provide books, papers, records, or other data obtained pursuant to section 7602 may also attend a summons interview and provide assistance to the IRS or Office of Chief Counsel employees in attendance, but may not question the summoned witness under oath or ask a summoned person’s representative to clarify an objection or assertion of privilege.  (B) Court reporters, translators, and interpreters are not barred from asking questions. Court reporters who are hired as contractors by the IRS to make a record of an IRS summons interview are permitted to ask typical housekeeping questions of a summoned witness. Examples of such questions include, but are not limited to, asking whether the witness swears to tell the truth, asking the witness to spell a word or phrase, and asking whether the witness can speak up or speak rather than gesture an answer. Translators and interpreters who are hired as contractors by the IRS to assist in the interview of a summoned witness are permitted to translate any of the questions that are asked of the witness by an IRS or Office of Chief Counsel officer or employee and to ask questions which may be necessary to clarify the translation.  * * * * *  (d) Applicability date. This section is applicable after September 3, 1982, except for paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, which are applicable on and after April 1, 2005, and paragraph (b)(3) of this section, which applies to examinations begun or administrative summonses served by the IRS on or after August 6, 2020. For rules under paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section that are applicable to summonses issued on or after September 10, 2002 or under paragraph (b)(3) of this section that are applicable to summons interviews conducted on or after June 18, 2014 and before July 14, 2016, see 26 CFR 301.7602-1T (revised as of April 1, 2016). For rules under paragraph (b)(3) of this section that are applicable to administrative summonses served by the IRS before August 6, 2020, see 26 CFR 301.7602-1 (revised as of April 1, 2020).  Douglas W. O’Donnell,  Deputy Commissioner for Services and Enforcement.  Approved: August 20, 2021  Mark J. Mazur,  Acting Assistant Secretary of the Treasury (Tax Policy).  (Filed by the Office of the Federal Register on September 2, 2021, 4:15 p.m., and published in the issue of the Federal Register for September 7, 2021, 86 FR 49923)  The Emergency Paid Sick Leave Act (EPSLA) and the Emergency Family and Medical Leave Expansion Act (EFMLEA), enacted as Divisions E and C of the Families First Act, respectively, generally required employers with fewer than 500 employees to provide paid leave due to certain circumstances related to COVID-19. Sections 7001 and 7003 of the Families First Act generally provided that non-governmental employers subject to the paid leave requirements under EPSLA and EFMLEA were entitled to fully refundable tax credits to cover the wages paid for leave taken for those periods of time during which employees are unable to work or telework for specified reasons related to COVID-19, plus allocable qualified health plan expenses.  Although the requirement to provide employees with paid leave under EPSLA and EFMLEA expired December 31, 2020, the tax credits for qualified leave wages paid for periods of leave taken beginning on April 1, 2020, and ending on December 31, 2020, were extended by the Tax Relief Act through March 31, 2021, for paid leave that would have satisfied the requirements of EPSLA and EFMLEA.  The ARP added sections 3131 through 3133 of the Code, which extend the refundable tax credits for paid leave to non-governmental employers with fewer than 500 employees, and certain governmental entities1 without regard to the number of employees, that provide paid sick and family leave for specified reasons related to COVID-19 with respect to periods of leave beginning on April 1, 2021, through September 30, 2021. The paid sick leave credit and the paid family leave credit (collectively, “paid sick and family leave credits”) under sections 3131 through 3133 are available to eligible employers that provide employees with paid leave that would have satisfied the requirements of EPSLA and EFMLEA, with certain modifications made pursuant to the ARP.  Under section 3131, a credit is available to eligible employers who pay qualified sick leave wages to an employee for up to 80 hours leave provided during the period beginning April 1, 2021, and ending September 30, 2021, if the employee is unable to work or telework because the employee:  (1) is subject to a Federal, State, or local quarantine or isolation order related to COVID-19;  (2) has been advised by a health care provider to self-quarantine due to concerns related to COVID-19;  (3) is experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 and seeking a medical diagnosis, is seeking or awaiting the results of a diagnostic test for, or a medical diagnosis of, COVID-19 and the employee has been exposed to COVID-19 or the employee’s employer has requested the test or diagnosis, or the employee is obtaining immunization related to COVID-19 or recovering from any injury, disability, illness, or condition related to the immunization;  (4) is caring for an individual who is subject to a Federal, State, or local quarantine or isolation order related to COVID-19, or has been advised by a health care provider to self-quarantine due to concerns related to COVID-19;  (5) is caring for a son or daughter of such employee if the school or place of care of the son or daughter has been closed, or the child care provider of the son or daughter is unavailable, due to COVID-19 precautions; or  (6) is experiencing any other substantially similar condition specified by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) in consultation with the Secretaries of the Treasury and Labor. The Secretary of HHS has specified, after consultation with the Secretaries of Treasury and Labor, that a substantially similar condition is one in which the employee takes leave:  to accompany an individual to obtain immunization related to COVID-19, or  to care for an individual who is recovering from any injury, disability, illness, or condition related to the immunization.2  If an employee is unable to work or telework for reasons related to COVID-19 described in (1), (2), or (3) above, qualified sick leave wages are wages paid at the employee’s regular rate of pay or, if higher, the Federal minimum wage or any applicable State or local minimum wage, up to a maximum of $511 per day and $5,110 in the aggregate. If an employee is unable to work or telework for reasons related to COVID-19 described in (4), (5), or (6) above, qualified sick leave wages are two-thirds of the wages paid at the employee’s regular rate of pay or, if higher, the Federal minimum wage or any applicable State or local minimum wage, up to a maximum of $200 per day and $2,000 in the aggregate.  Under section 3132, a credit is available to eligible employers who pay qualified family leave wages to an employee for up to 12 weeks of paid family leave provided during the period beginning April 1, 2021, and ending September 30, 2021, if the employee is unable to work or telew"

(d)Except as provided in the following sentence, any Special Meeting shall be held at such hour and day as may be designated by whichever of the Board of Directors or the Chief Executive Officer shall have called such meeting. In the case of any Special Meeting called by the Chief Executive Officer upon the demand of shareowners (a ""Demand Special Meeting""), such meeting shall be held at such hour and day as may be designated by the Board of Directors; provided, however, that the date of any Demand Special Meeting shall be not more than seventy days after the Meeting Record Date (as defined in Section 3.6 hereof); and providedfurther that in the event that the directors then in office fail to designate an hour and date for a Demand Special Meeting within ten days after the date that valid written demands for such meeting by the holders of record as of the Demand Record Date of shares representing at least 10% of all the votes entitled to be cast on each issue proposed to be considered at the Special Meeting are delivered (as determined in according with paragraph (c) of this Section 3.2) to the Corporation (the ""Delivery Date""), then such meeting shall be held at 2:00 P.M. local time on the 100th day after the Delivery Date or, if such 100th day is not a Business Day (as defined below), on the first preceding Business Day. In fixing a meeting date for any Special Meeting, the Board of Directors or the Chief Executive Officer may consider such factors as it or the Chief Executive Officer deems relevant within the good faith exercise of its or the Chief Executive Officer's business judgment, including, without limitation, the nature of the action proposed to be taken, the facts and circumstances surrounding any demand for such meeting, and any plan of the Board of Directors to call an Annual Meeting or a Special Meeting for the conduct of related business.  (e)The Corporation may engage regionally or nationally recognized independent inspectors of elections to act as an agent of the Corporation for the purpose of promptly performing a ministerial review of the validity of any purported written demand or demands for a Special Meeting received by the Corporate Secretary. For the purpose of permitting the inspectors to perform such review, no purported demand shall be deemed to have been delivered to the Corporation until the earlier of (i) five Business Days following receipt by the Corporate Secretary of such purported demand and (ii) such date as the independent inspectors certify to the Corporation that the valid demands received by the Corporate Secretary represent at least 10% of all the votes entitled to be cast on each issue proposed to be considered at the Special Meeting. Nothing contained in this paragraph (e) shall in any way be construed to suggest or imply that the Board of Directors or any shareowner shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any demand, whether during or after such five Business Day period, or to take any other action (including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution or defense of any litigation with respect thereto).  (f)For purposes of these Bylaws, ""Business Day"" shall mean any day other than a Saturday, a Sunday or a day on which banking institutions in the State of Wisconsin are authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close.  Section 3.3PLACE OF MEETING; USE OF REMOTE COMMUNICATIONS.  (a)Subject to paragraph (b) below, the Board of Directors or the Chief Executive Officer may designate any place, either within or without the State of Wisconsin, as the place for any Annual Meeting or any Special Meeting, or for any postponement thereof, and if no designation is made, the place of meeting shall be the principal office of the Corporation. Any meeting may be adjourned to reconvene at any place designated by vote of the Board of Directors or determined by the Chief Executive Officer.  (b)The Board of Directors, may, in its sole discretion, determine that any Annual Meeting or any Special Meeting shall not be held at any place, but may instead be held solely by means of remote communication. The Board of Directors may also determine, in its sole discretion, that shareowners and proxies of shareowners not physically present at the designated place of any Annual Meeting or any Special Meeting may participate in the meeting by means of remote communication.  Section 3.4NOTICE OF MEETINGS - Written notice stating the date, time, place (if any) and the means of remote communications (if any) of any meeting of shareowners shall be delivered not less than ten days nor more than sixty days before the date of the meeting (unless a different time period is provided by the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law or the Articles of Incorporation), by or at the direction of the Chief Executive Officer or the Corporate Secretary, to each shareowner of record entitled to vote at such meeting (other than a shareowner that the   Corporation is not required to give such notice to under the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law) and to such other persons as required by the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law.

General Rules and Regulations for Electronic Filings,STAR EQUITY : 2020 Annual Report,MarketScreener.com | All Latest News,MarketScreener,"STAR EQUITY : 2020 Annual Report  2020 ANNUAL REPORT Dear Fellow Stockholders, 2020 was a year of significant change for Star Equity Holdings (""Star Equity""). The COVID-19 pandemic created an unprecedented operating environment for our businesses, and I want to thank all of our dedicated employees for their flexibility and hard work throughout these challenging and uncertain times. Also, we grew Construction division revenue significantly and announced a sale of DMS Health representing approximately 40% of revenues for the Healthcare division allowing us to pay down a significant amount of debt. We believe our holding company growth strategy and value enhancement initiatives will lead to increased revenue, cash flow, earnings and, ultimately, stockholder value. Over time, we expect to use our cash flow to accelerate our growth by funding both internal growth investments and bolt-on acquisitions. We will also look to create new business divisions in the future through the disciplined acquisition of businesses complementary to our holding company structure. Additionally, Star Equity has approximately $94.9 million of useable net operating losses (""NOL"") in the United States, which the Company considers to be a very valuable asset for its stockholders. Protecting the value of this NOL asset limits the amount of stock than can be repurchased over a given time period. In order to protect the value of the NOL for all stockholders, the Company has a tax benefit preservation plan (the ""Rights Plan"") in place that limits beneficial ownership of Star Equity common stock to 4.99%. The ratification of the Rights Plan and a charter amendment, both related to protecting the NOL, are up for approval at the upcoming stockholder meeting. Stockholders who wish to own more than 4.99% of Star Equity common stock, or already own more than 4.99% of Star Equity common stock and wish to buy more, may only acquire additional shares with the board's prior written approval. We have a bright future ahead of us. As we review our business and market moving forward, we are very excited about our prospects and our potential for growth through our new holding company strategy. The entire Executive Team at Star Equity is dedicated to this growth plan strategy, and we are working hard to ensure its continued deployment and continued value to YOU, our stockholders. Thank you to our stockholders, our employees, our board, and our executive team - with your continued support, we have accomplished many things, and we look forward to continuing working together into the future.

The COVID-19 pandemic created an unprecedented operating environment for our businesses, and I want to thank all of our dedicated employees for their flexibility and hard work throughout these challenging and uncertain times. Also, we grew Construction division revenue significantly and announced a sale of DMS Health representing approximately 40% of revenues for the Healthcare division allowing us to pay down a significant amount of debt.                       We believe our holding company growth strategy and value enhancement initiatives will lead to increased revenue, cash flow, earnings and, ultimately, stockholder value. Over time, we expect to use our cash flow to accelerate our growth by funding both internal growth investments and bolt-on acquisitions. We will also look to create new business divisions in the future through the disciplined acquisition of businesses complementary to our holding company structure.                       Additionally, Star Equity has approximately $94.9 million of useable net operating losses (""NOL"") in the United States, which the Company considers to be a very valuable asset for its stockholders. Protecting the value of this NOL asset limits the amount of stock than can be repurchased over a given time period. In order to protect the value of the NOL for all stockholders, the Company has a tax benefit preservation plan (the ""Rights Plan"") in place that limits beneficial ownership of Star Equity common stock to 4.99%. The ratification of the Rights Plan and a charter amendment, both related to protecting the NOL, are up for approval at the upcoming stockholder meeting. Stockholders who wish to own more than 4.99% of Star Equity common stock, or already own more than 4.99% of Star Equity common stock and wish to buy more, may only acquire additional shares with the board's prior written approval.                       We have a bright future ahead of us. As we review our business and market moving forward, we are very excited about our prospects and our potential for growth through our new holding company strategy.                       The entire Executive Team at Star Equity is dedicated to this growth plan strategy, and we are working hard to ensure its continued deployment and continued value to YOU, our stockholders.                       Thank you to our stockholders, our employees, our board, and our executive team - with your continued support, we have accomplished many things, and we look forward to continuing working together into the future.

Immediately after the Domestication, (i) Nerdy will cause each outstanding class of preferred units and the Nerdy profit units (whether vested or unvested) to be automatically converted into Nerdy common units (""Nerdy Common Units"") (subject to substantially the same terms and conditions, including applicable vesting requirements) (the ""Nerdy Recapitalization"") and (ii) TCV Blocker will consummate certain restructuring transactions such that, following such transactions, TCV Blocker will directly own common units in Nerdy, Inc.  1   On September 20, 2021, TPG Pace Merger Sub merged with and into Nerdy, with Nerdy surviving the Merger, and Blocker Merger Sub I merged with and into TCV Blocker, with TCV Blocker surviving such merger, and Blocker Merger Sub II merged with and into Learn Blocker, with Learn Blocker surviving such merger, and immediately following the Merger and Reverse Blocker Mergers, each surviving Blocker merged with and into Nerdy Inc., with Nerdy Inc. surviving each Direct Blocker Merger. The aggregate consideration paid to the holders of Nerdy equity (including the owners of the Blockers with respect to their indirect interest in Nerdy equity and the holders of Nerdy unit appreciation rights and profit units to the extent entitled to consideration, as described below) is based on an enterprise value of $1,250,000 thousand (subject to certain debt related adjustments) and consisted of (i) an amount of cash equal to the excess of the amount of available cash over $250,000 thousand (but not to exceed $388,200 thousand), plus (ii) equity consideration valued at $10.00 per share/unit in respect of the remaining portion of Nerdy's enterprise value after deducting the cash consideration in clause (i), plus (iii) certain Nerdy warrants, plus (iv) the Nerdy Earnout Consideration, if payable. In addition, immediately after the completion of the Transaction, certain investors have agreed to subscribe for and purchase 15,000,000 shares of Class A common stock for an aggregate of $150,000 thousand in the PIPE Financing. In addition, pursuant to the Forward Purchase Agreements certain investors have purchased 15,000,000 Class A Shares at a price of $10.00 per share, plus an aggregate of 3,000,000 warrants to purchase one Class A share at $11.50 per share, at an aggregate transaction price of approximately $150,000 thousand. With respect to certain of the additional forward purchases, TPG Pace issued an additional 1,116,750 shares of Class A Common stock, of which 66,950 Class A Shares was issued to affiliates of TPG Global, including 500 Class A Shares issued to an officer of TPG Pace, for no additional cash consideration, lowering for certain additional forward purchasers, including the affiliates of TPG Global referenced above, the effective purchase price per Class A Share and one-fifth warrant to approximately $9.09 per share, compared to the $10.00 per share public offering price in the TPG Pace IPO.  In connection with the Transaction, certain of Nerdy's equity holders received 4,000,000 earnout shares and 2,444,444 warrants (the ""Nerdy Earnout Consideration"") contingent upon achieving certain market share price milestones within a period of 60 months post Transaction. These earnout shares will be forfeited if the set milestones are not reached. The Nerdy Earnout Consideration will be deemed to have been earned in the event of a change of control if the change of control occurs within a period of 60 months post Transaction. The Nerdy Earnout Consideration shares include voting rights and are eligible to receive nonforfeitable dividends to the extent dividends are declared but does not contractually obligate the holders of such shares to participate in losses.  In connection with the Transaction, certain of TPG Pace's equity holders received 4,000,000 earnout shares and 4,888,889 warrants (the ""Sponsor Earnout Consideration"") contingent upon achieving certain market share price milestones within a period of 60 months post Transaction. These earnout shares will be forfeited if the set milestones are not reached. The Sponsor Earnout Consideration will be deemed to have been earned in the event of a change of control if the change of control occurs within a period of 60 months post Transaction. The Sponsor Earnout Consideration shares include voting rights and are eligible to receive nonforfeitable dividends to the extent dividends are declared but does not contractually obligate the holders of such shares to participate in losses.  The following summarizes the pro forma number of Class A and Class B Common Stock outstanding following the consummation of the Transaction, the PIPE Financing and the Forward Purchase Agreements, discussed further in the sections below, based on the exercise price of all vested existing equity of Nerdy at the consummation of the Transaction excluding the potential dilutive effect of the exercise or vesting of warrants, stock-based compensation, Nerdy Earnout Consideration, and Sponsor Earnout Consideration:   In connection with the Transaction, Nerdy Inc. entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement. The Tax Receivable Agreement generally provides for the payment by Nerdy Inc. to certain holders of Nerdy Common Units (or their permitted assignees) (""TRA Holders"") of 85% of the net cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax that Nerdy Inc. actually realizes (or is deemed to realize in certain circumstances) in periods after the Transaction as a result of: (i) certain increases in tax basis that occur as a result of (A) the Transaction (including as a result of cash received in the Transaction and debt repayment occurring in connection with the Transaction) or (B) exercises of the redemption or call rights set forth in the OpCo LLC Agreement; and (ii) imputed interest deemed to be paid by Nerdy Inc. as a result of, and additional basis arising from, any payments Nerdy Inc. makes under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Nerdy Inc. will retain the benefit of the remaining 15% of these net cash savings. If Nerdy Inc. elects to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement early, Nerdy Inc. would be required to make an immediate payment equal to the present value of the anticipated future payments to be made by it to the TRA Holders under the Tax Receivable Agreement (based upon certain valuation assumptions and deemed events set forth in the Tax Receivable Agreement). If a change of control occurs (as defined under the Tax Receivable Agreement, which includes certain mergers, asset sales and other forms of business combinations and certain changes to the composition of the Nerdy Inc. board), the Tax Receivable Agreement will remain in effect with respect to each TRA Holder (provided that certain valuation assumptions, including that there will be sufficient income to utilize all tax attributes covered by the Tax Receivable Agreement, will be utilized to determine the payments to be made under the Tax Receivable Agreement), unless such TRA Holder elects (or the representative of the TRA Holders causes all of the TRA Holders to elect) to receive its early termination payment in connection with the change of control transaction.  Anticipated Accounting treatment  The Transaction will be accounted for as a reverse recapitalization in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (""GAAP""). Under this method of accounting, TPG Pace will be treated as the ""acquired"" company for financial reporting purposes. This determination was primarily based on Existing Nerdy Holders expecting to comprise a majority of the voting power of the combined company, Nerdy's operations prior to the acquisition comprising the only ongoing operations of Nerdy Inc., and Nerdy's senior management comprising a majority of the senior management of Nerdy Inc. Following the Transaction, Nerdy LLC will be governed by a Board of Managers consisting of five Managers with three Managers designated by Nerdy Inc. and two Managers that were designated by the members holding a majority of the then outstanding vested units held by members other than Nerdy Inc. Under this method of accounting, the ongoing financial statements of the registrant will reflect the net assets of Nerdy and TPG Pace at historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recognized.  The Company is currently evaluating the appropriate accounting treatment related to the noncontrolling interest associated with the outstanding Nerdy LLC units held by certain Existing Nerdy Holders. For purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information, the noncontrolling interest has been classified as a component of permanent equity. However, it is possible upon completion of the evaluation the noncontrolling interest could be considered redeemable noncontrolling interest and would be required to be: (a) classified as a component of temporary or ""mezzanine"" equity separate from permanent equity and (b) subsequently measured at redemption value if it is greater than the carrying amount determined based on ASC 810 (which is the initial carrying value adjusted for allocations of profits and loss and contributions/distributions) with any adjustments recorded as an adjustment to additional paid-in-capital.  The Company is currently evaluating the accounting treatment related to certain warrants upon the close of the Transaction. For purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information, all warrants are classified as derivative liability instruments. However, the evaluation and finalization of accounting conclusions regarding the classification are ongoing and subject to change.  For purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information, all earnouts are classified as derivative liability instruments. Upon the close of the Transaction, certain earnouts were provided to employees of the Company. The Company is currently evaluating whether any of these earnouts represents compensation expense pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation (""ASC 718"").  Basis of Pro Forma Presentation  The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements have been presented for illustrative purposes only and do not necessarily reflect what Nerdy Inc.'s financial condition or results of operations would have been had the Transaction, the PIPE Financing, and the Forward Purchase Agreements occurred on the dates indicated. Further, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information also may not be useful in predicting the future financial condition and results of operations of Nerdy Inc. The actual financial position and results of operations may differ significantly from the pro forma amounts reflected herein due to a variety of factors. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information also does not give effect to the potential impact of any anticipated synergies, operating efficiencies or cost savings that may result from the Pro Forma Transactions. The unaudited pro forma adjustments represent management's estimates based on information available as of the date of these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements and are subject to change as additional information becomes available and analyses are performed. However, management believes that the assumptions provide a reasonable basis for presenting the significant effects of the Pro Forma Transactions as contemplated and that t"

On 21 September 2021, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) published the keynote address that Natasha Cazenave (Executive Director, ESMA) gave at the Saline del Risparmio on 17 September 2021. The keynote address is entitled Retail investors’ challenges: what investor protection safeguards should accompany increased retail participation in capital markets?  The keynote address focuses on the following areas:  Costs and performances of investment funds. Among other things ESMA is currently coordinating a Common Supervisory Action on costs and fees in UCITS funds across Europe, to assess the compliance of supervised entities with a number of provisions in the UCITS framework, including the obligation of not charging investors undue costs. At the beginning of next year ESMA will analyse the results of Member States’ competent authorities supervisory efforts and is hopeful that this exercise can contribute to greater convergence and focus on investor outcomes.  Distribution of retail investment products and related disclosures. In relation to digital distribution, ESMA plans to publish a call for evidence to gather information which may contribute to shape the policy advice that will be shared with the Commission and looks forward to receiving contributions and views.  When advising the Commission on this important topic in March 2020, ESMA encouraged the Commission to conduct further analysis to assess the impact the MiFID II inducements regime has had on the distribution of retail investment products across the EU and the impact that a ban would have on different distribution models. In the meantime, ESMA has taken action on the basis of existing requirements by making clearer its position on the application of some key obligations on inducements with the objective to promote further convergence among firms and supervisors. The Commission is currently using the opportunity of the MiFID II review to make such an assessment.  Challenges from an investor protection perspective of the growing demand for products marketed as sustainable or deemed to incorporate Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors. The European Supervisory Authorities have already delivered one set of technical rules underpinning the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) and is working on a second set of rules related to the taxonomy-specific products disclosures. A key challenge in developing the detailed product disclosures has been to attain comparability of disclosures across the very different underlying documents prescribed by the SFDR. At one extreme, the pan-European pension product, has SFDR pre-contractual sustainability disclosures in the four-five page long key information document. At the other extreme, a UCITS fund has those same disclosures in its prospectus, which can run to hundreds of pages."

Fair Labor Standards Act,DOL Extends FLSA Final Joint Employment Rule Effective Date,Faegre Drinker Biddle & Reath | Insights,Faegre Drinker Biddle & Reath,"DOL Extends FLSA Final Joint Employment Rule Effective Date  The federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) requires employers to pay non-exempt employees at least minimum wage plus overtime compensation. If an employee is unpaid or underpaid — due to a calculation error or an employee’s unreported time worked, including remote work arrangements during the pandemic — the employee may recover back pay, liquidated damages, attorneys’ fees and litigation costs. If two or more employers have a relationship with an employee — for example, if an employee works for a staffing agency and is assigned to work at the agency’s customer or an employee performs work for two with common ownership or management — the law may deem the employers to be joint employers with joint and several liability, depending on the facts. If one joint employer fails to comply with the FLSA, both joint employers may be held liable. Different laws use different tests for joint employment.  In 2020, the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) under the Trump Administration issued a rule adopting a four-factor test for joint employment under the FLSA. That test would have considered whether the potential joint employer hires or discharges employees; supervises or controls work schedules; sets pay rates; and maintains employment records. This test focuses on the actual control over the relationship, and is generally a higher standard to meet.  In March 2021, the Biden Administration’s DOL rescinded the Trump Administration’s rule. Under the Biden Administration, the DOL will use the economic realities test, which examines whether the worker is economically dependent on the potential joint employer by looking at the totality of the circumstances. The Biden Administration’s final rule was supposed to become effective September 28, 2021. However, the DOL moved the effective date to October 5, 2021. Beginning October 5, 2021, the DOL will use the economic realities test to determine joint employment status for purposes of the FLSA.  For example, if an employer uses a staffing agency, the agency should be financially sound and give contractual assurances that it does, and will, comply with the FLSA. Similarly, a staffing agency will want to make sure the worksite employer abides by all applicable laws. Defense and indemnification provisions may also be considered. Employers should also make sure to comply with all applicable laws governing employment generally while keeping in mind that different state laws require different tests to determine joint employer liability. Employers with questions concerning wage & hour compliance — including joint employer liability — should consult with employment counsel."

We have selected the most relevant and important news articles related to registered investment adviser (""RIA"") compliance and regulatory issues. This week's recap focuses on systems to prevent financial exploitation of elderly, the Securities and Exchange Commission's ""SEC"" top priorities, Form CRS, and the North American Securities Administrators Association ""NASAA"" upcoming regulatory focus areas.  Here's our top investment adviser compliance articles for the week of September 17th, 2021:  1. State regulators: Advisers fall short in guarding against senior financial abuse (Author – Mark Schoeff Jr., InvestmentNews)  Mark Schoeff Jr. sheds light on the lack of internal systems within state-registered RIA firms, to identify and address financial exploitation of elderly clients. This determination comes from the findings of exams conducted earlier this year by the North American Securities Administrators Association ""NASAA"". President of the NASAA, Lisa Hopkins describes how she hopes the findings from the survey will lead to earlier detection and reporting of suspected elderly abuse.  The article also mentions additional findings from NASAA's exam sweep, concluding that the top five areas with deficiencies were registration, books and records, contracts, supervision and compliance, and advertising.  2. 4 SEC Hot Buttons Advisors Should Address Immediately (Author – Thomas D. Giachetti, Think Advisor)  This article covers four ""hot buttons"" under the regulatory spotlight, that advisors should address right away. The four areas of concern include the following: 1) margin interest, meaning advisors should assess any instances of clients being billed on higher margin values, as the SEC is actively seeking reimbursement for clients unless there is a clear 2A Brochure disclosure, 2) billing on cash, especially in this low-yield environment, 3) using or being associated with wrap-fee programs, and back-tested hypothetical presentations.  3. Fiduciary advocates call on SEC to fix Form CRS (Author – Mark Schoeff Jr., InvestmentNews)  Form CRS still holds its position as a hot topic in the wealth management industry, specifically gaining attention from fiduciary advocates. The Institute for the Fiduciary Standard called on the SEC to improve the disclosure document which should be used to clealry define differences between investment advisers and broker-dealers. Mark Schoeff Jr. discusses the findings from a recent study conducted by the Insititute for the Fiduciary Standard, concluding that the document is often full of financial jargon versus being in plain language for investors to comprehend. The artidcle points out that members of the SEC have responded by showing support for future plans to reassess Form CRS.  4. Texting: The Holy Grail for Modern Financial Services Professionals (Author – Michael Boese, Wealth Management)  Michael Boese shares how texting has become the next best medium for financial advisors to communicate with their clients and prospects. Compared to email, text messages yield a much higher open rate, which Boese attributes to the lack of spam via text messages.  Advisors must consider how they will remain in compliance if they choose to go the texting route. The article mentions the complications associated with collecting and monitoring text messages, as well as differentiating what is friendly communication versus professional advice. Complications aside, it is suggested for firms to consider secure and compliant texting solutions to drive productivity and sales.  5. New NASAA President to Prioritize Expungements, Digital Assets (Author – Patrick Donachie, Wealth Management)  The recently appointed President of NASAA, Melanie Senter Lubin announced the organization's top priorities during her first public address. Lubin discussed plans to reevaluate the expungement process for advisors and brokers as she believes it to be an "" extraordinary event granted only in particular cases"" and that updates would protect investors deciding which advisors to trust with their financial wellbeing. Additional priorities include elderly investor protection initiatives and cryptocurrencies and digital assets. The NASAA's focus on cryptocurrencies and digital assets has carried over from the pervious year, noting a significant increase of investigations in this area in 2020.  Don't forget to check out last week's top RIA compliance news articles that focus on RIA in a Box's new Advisor Virtual Desktop and Dashboard solution, cybersecurity threats to RIAs, regulatory changes for compensation model requirements, and a deep dive on the independent RIA model."
False Claims Act,DOJ Announces $1 Million Urine Drug Testing Fraud Settlement,"LXBN | Business Litigation, Contracts Law, Noncompete",LXBN,"Erica Blachman Hitchings  DOJ Announces $1 Million Urine Drug Testing Fraud Settlement  The Department of Justice has recovered $1 million in a urine drug testing fraud settlement with Nevada Advanced Pain Specialists (NAPS). The False Claims Act (FCA) settlement resolves allegations that the Reno-based medical practice submitted false claims to Medicare. The government alleges that NAPS conducted urine drug testing (UDT) that was not medically necessary. Moreover,...  The Department of Justice has recovered $1 million in a urine drug testing fraud settlement with Nevada Advanced Pain Specialists (NAPS). The False Claims Act (FCA) settlement resolves allegations that the Reno-based medical practice submitted false claims to Medicare. The government alleges that NAPS conducted urine drug testing (UDT) that was not medically necessary. Moreover, NAPS then submitted those false claims for reimbursement to Medicare, resulting in false claims.  The Alleged Urine Drug Testing Fraud  The government’s allegations involve improper billing for urine drug tests. There are two types of urine drug tests at issue. First, there is a drug screening test, known as a presumptive UDT. Second, there is a more precise test that can identify the concentration of a drug in a patient’s urine. This second type of test is known as a confirmatory UDT.  The government alleges that NAPS ordered the second-level confirmatory test without first getting the results of the initial presumptive test. That is, NAPS would conduct a presumptive urine drug test in-house. But rather than waiting for the result before proceeding to the confirmatory test, NAPS would always order the second-level confirmatory test. In fact, NAPS admits that it did not even review the result of the first test before ordering the confirmatory urine drug test.  Yet NAPS still billed Medicare for the presumptive urine drug test as if it were medically necessary. Moreover, NAPS admits that the result of the presumptive test played no role in its medical decision-making.  NAPS ordered urine drug tests to collect money from Medicare – not because the tests were medically necessary. This scheme violated the FCA. In addition, it drained resources from an important federal program. Joseph R. Bonavolonta, Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Boston Division explained:  Public health insurance programs, such as Medicare, incur staggering financial losses when their programs are exploited. Today’s settlement should make it perfectly clear that those who bill for medically unnecessary tests will be held accountable.  This is One of Several Recent Urine Drug Testing Fraud Settlements  A whistleblower brought this fraud to light. The whistleblower filed a lawsuit under the qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act. The Act allows a private party, called a “relator,” to bring a suit on behalf of the government and to share in the government’s recovery. The relator received $150,000 of the government’s $1 million recovery. This whistleblower suit fits right in with several other recent FCA actions involving urine drug testing.  Rhode Island  Just last year, the United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Rhode Island filed suit against several related medical groups and their owner. The government alleges that the medical groups collected $1.5 million from Medicare and Medicaid for urine drug tests they did not perform.  Connecticut  In June, Connecticut Addiction Medicine (“CAM”) paid $1 million in a urine drug testing fraud settlement. The government alleged that the practice billed Medicare and Medicaid for medically unnecessary urine drug tests. For each patient, CAM used presumptive UDT and ordered confirmatory UDT. Because of this tactic, Medicare and Medicaid overpaid CAM for unnecessary UDT. As a result, these critical programs had less money for legitimate medical needs.  Our Ongoing Urine Drug Testing Fraud Case  Last year, the Massachusetts Attorney General intervened in one of our client’s cases. As we describe in more detail here, the defendant (CleanSlate Centers) operated a chain of for-profit addiction-treatment centers. These centers exploited the national opioid epidemic with a model that prioritized profit over patient care. As part of the scheme, CleanSlate required unnecessary and expensive urine drug testing at every patient visit.  As Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey explained:  This company’s business model was to illegally profit by cheating our state Medicaid program, which provides vital health care resources to some of our most vulnerable residents. We will take legal action against this kind of misconduct in order to recover funds for our state and protect the integrity of MassHealth.  Whistleblowers with information about these schemes can play a role in stopping fraud and protecting taxpayer dollars. If you have information about urine drug testing fraud, or any other health care fraud scheme, we can help. Please contact us for a free, confidential conversation.

False Claims Act,Huawei heiress to be freed after deal with US,Yahoo! Finance | Basic Materials Wholesale Industry News,Yahoo!,"Bitcoin slides on China crypto crackdown - live updates  09:37 AM  Fresh China clampdown hits Bitcoin  Bitcoin has dropped below $44,000 after China's central bank deemed that all crypto transactions are illegal, sending shockwaves through the world of digital currencies.  Bitcoin dropped 3.3pc to $43,219 while Ether sank over 6pc. Litecoin, Dash, Bitcoin Cash and EOS were all over 5pc lower after the People's Bank of China's decision was published.  The central bank said it would ban overseas exchanges from providing services to mainland investors.  09:04 AM  Sunak orders review of bank rules after Greensill saga  The Government is looking at strengthening some of the UK's financial regulations after they were criticised in a report into the collapse of Greensill Capital.  Chancellor Rishi Sunak said in a letter to the Treasury Committee that his department had started to review the appointed representatives regime. An appointed representative is a firm or person that conducts regulated business on behalf of a directly FCA-authorised firm.  Sunak wrote that the Treasury “will consider legislative reforms that may be necessary to strengthen the oversight of appointed representatives and to prevent opportunities for abuse of the system”.  The committee published a report in July saying the current rules were being used “well beyond” their original purpose.  A Greensill subsidiary piggybacked on the regulatory license of an unrelated firm through the appointed representatives regime, which was originally designed for sole traders. This meant that a private firm was responsible for ensuring that Greensill adhered to UK regulations, rather than the FCA.  German business confidence fell to a five-month low in September amid a ""bottleneck"" recession just before voters go to the polls to elect Chancellor Angela Merkel's successor.  The Ifo Institute's index fell to 98.8 from 99.6 in August, deeper than economists’ expectations in a Bloomberg survey. An index measuring expectations for the next months also fell, as did one assessing current conditions.  The data highlights the challenges faced by German business as they battle supply chain disruptions that have hit the country's sizeable manufacturing industry. Continued Covid infections also threaten the economy's recovery.  Ifo President Clemens Fuest said: “Problems in the procurement of raw materials and intermediate products are putting the brakes on the German economy. Manufacturing is experiencing a bottleneck recession.”  While manufacturing has been hardest hit, a separate survey release on Thursday showed momentum in Germany service sector also slowed.  08:04 AM  Shapps: 'Systemic' problems in haulage industry  Grant Shapps has admitted that there are ""systemic"" problems in the UK's haulage sector and that more had to be done to make it a ""more attractive industry"".  The Transport Secretary told BBC Breakfast: ""Traditionally, this has been - and these are extraordinary figures - a 99pc white male profession, average age 55, conditions not great, truck stops not great.  ""And the salaries have been suppressed over many years by people coming in and driving and being prepared to do that at lower wages.  ""So we need to resolve the systemic problems as well and that's why, as I say, we are doing everything we possible can to open up the capacity and bring more people in.""  He told Sky News: ""We need to make this a more attractive industry to go into and the solution to that is to have those slightly higher wages and better conditions at truck stops and the like as well.""  Mr Shapps told the broadcaster the wage base for hauliers had been held down by ""importing cheap European, often eastern European, labour, undercutting the domestic market and creating more long-term problems"".  07:38 AM  FTSE 100 opens in the red  Meanwhile the FTSE 100 has sunk 0.24pc at the open to 7,050.7 points as growth worries persisted after yesterday's warning from the Bank of England that inflation is likely to climb above its previous forecast of 4pc.  AstraZeneca jumped 2.7pc to the top of the main London index after trials of its prostate cancer drug Lynparza showed positive results.  However, retail stocks such as JD Sports (down 2.6pc), industrial miners and life insurers were the top losing sectors.  It comes amid growing worries over energy bills, food costs and tax hikes, which conspired to push consumer confidence in the economy to its steepest fall since October 2020.  Mid-cap index the FTSE 250 fell 0.36pc.  07:26 AM  Shapps: 'I will move heaven and Earth to solve petrol crisis'  Grant Shapps has said he will move ""heaven and Earth"" so that petrol and other goods can continue moving around the country easily.  The Transport Secretary earlier blamed the pandemic for the shortage of lorry drivers that prompted BP to shut fuel forecourts that it simply could not reach to stock up.  Now he has told the BBC Today programme:  I'll move heaven and Earth to do anything that's required to make sure that lorries carry on moving our good and services and petrol around the country.  I'll do anything which actually helps. The big query actually is where is the blockage? What we do know is that there are a lot of people who have their HGV licences but many of which will have lapsed to come out of the market, often because there has been cheaper European labour.  We want to get those people back in.  It’s impossible for consumers to ignore the challenges all around us.  Now is also the time that many retailers are ramping up for the festive season. It remains to be seen quite how many challenges they face and how this will be received by consumers, who are preparing to spend big after last year’s cancellations, but who may be left frustrated by a lack of choice and availability.  The grocery industry has been preparing some time for the months ahead, and retailers are having to make bold and often difficult decisions to ensure that the best possible products and shopping experiences will still be available at Christmas – even if that means cutting product lines temporarily for now.|  We will need to wait and see whether confidence takes a further knock due to this lack of choice. After last year’s muted festivities, families may decide to go all-out with the quality of their gifts and Christmas dinner, rather than quantity, and the Christmas spirit may override frustration caused by limited choices.  07:06 AM  Cost of living crisis blow to consumer confidence  Consumer confidence has plunged amid increasing anxiety about the rising cost of living, a long-running survey suggests.  PA has the details:  GfK's Consumer Confidence Barometer fell by five points to minus 13 in September, a drop not seen since October last year.  All measures of the survey, including confidence in the general economic situation and personal finances, were down in comparison to last month.  The index also recorded a three-point drop to minus six in the major purchase index, an indicator of consumer confidence in buying big ticket items, in worrying news for hard-pressed retailers looking to build sales as they go into the key holiday period.  Confidence in personal finances over the last 12 months dropped four points to minus four, while the forecast for the next 12 months fell six points to five - although it remains four points higher than this time last year.  Expectations for the general economic situation over the coming 12 months fell 10 points to minus 16, but is still 22 points higher than September last year.  GfK client strategy director Joe Staton said: ""On the back of concerns about rising prices for fuel and food, the growth in headline inflation, tax hikes, empty shelves and the end of the furlough scheme, September sees consumers slamming on the brakes as those already in economic hardship anticipate a potential cost of living crisis.  ""All measures have declined this month and consumers are clearly worrying about their personal financial situation and the wider economic prospects for the year ahead.""  ""When consumer confidence drops, shoppers tend to spend less, and this dampens the overall economic prospects for the UK. This really is an unwelcome picture going into 2022 and beyond.""  06:50 AM  Shapps tells motorists to 'carry on as normal'  Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has told motorists to ""carry on as normal"" after BP was forced to close petrol stations yesterday owing to a lack of lorry drivers to deliver fuel.  Mr Shapps told Sky News: ""The advice would be to carry on as normal, and that is what BP is saying as well.  ""They describe it on the average day that they have a handful of petrol stations that they had to close out of 1,200.  ""The problem is not new. There has been a lack of drivers for many months through this pandemic because during the lockdown drivers couldn't be passed through their lorry HGV tests, and that is what has led to this problem.  ""But many more tests are being made available now, so we should see it smooth out fairly quickly.""  The minister denied that Brexit was part of the problem for recruiting HGV drivers in the UK, instead arguing that being divorced from the EU had helped enable some of the solutions.  ""I've seen people point to Brexit as if it is the culprit here. In fact, they are wrong,"" Mr Shapps said.  ""Not only are there very large and even larger shortages in other EU countries like Poland and Germany, which clearly can't be to do with Brexit, but actually because of Brexit I've been able to change the law and alter the way our driving tests operate in a way I could not have done if we were still part of the EU.  ""So, Brexit actually has provided part of the solution of giving more slots available for HGV tests and there are a lot more - twice as many - tests available now than before the pandemic, a large proportion of those we've only been able to do because we are no longer in the EU.""  Instead he blamed the pandemic, calling the driver shortage a ""global"" issue, adding: ""Europe is hit particularly bad.""  ""We've got, for example, in Germany a 60,000 shortage and Poland a 123,000 shortage of lorry drivers, so as I say it is the principal cause of the problem and we are working very hard to change it, including changing the law in order to provide more tests for HGV drivers and encouraging people back into the market.  ""There are longer-term problems, which is that it is difficult - it is a long day's work, it is hard work, it is a skilled job and, actually, it has been underpaid up until now, so we very much welcome the salary going up, the wages going up, and that's attracting more people back to the sector.""  06:23 AM  FTSE 100 to inch higher  Good morning.  The FTSE 100 is expected to inch higher this morning after yesterday's climb was cut short by the Bank of England's warning that inflation will be even higher than its 4pc forecast amid the ongoing supply chain crisis.  That sent the pound soaring 0.6pc against the dollar yesterday as London's main index ran out of steam, falling to 7,078.35 points by the close of trading.  Today it is set to open 0.16pc higher to hit 7,088 points after Germany and France bourses posted close to 1pc gains.  Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said: ""Yesterday saw another positive day for European markets, rising for the third day in a row, shrugging off early week concerns about the Chinese property market, and despite evidence that the wider economy is slowing, due to increasing supply chain constraints.  ""The FTSE100 did its best to reprise its role as the perennial party pooper, sliding back from its intraday highs, to finish in negative territory, which in some part may have been down to the sharp rise in the pound, and gilt yields.  ""Nonetheless markets in Europe, as well as the US are now back in positive territory for the week, a scenario that didn’t look very likely back on Monday, when fears of an Evergrande bankruptcy had investors circling the wagons.""  5 things to start your day  1) Interest rates set to rise as soon as February amid inflation surge: The Bank of England has been forced to revise up its inflation forecasts as surging energy costs, labour shortages and chaos in the supply chain hold back Britain's recovery from Covid.  2) Alarm as petrol stations begin rationing fuel: Motorists were warned on Thursday night of shortages at fuel forecourts as BP announced it was closing pumps and rationing petrol and diesel because of a lack of lorry drivers.  3) George Osborne brings in Russian oligarch to his new investment bank: George Osborne has won his new investment bank employer a role advising EN+, the Russian metals giant founded by Oleg Deripaska, according to reports.  4) British Airways abandons plans for new budget airline at Gatwick: British Airways is poised to scrap almost all short-haul flights from Gatwick after pilots rejected the carrier's plan to set up a new budget airline and hand them sweeping pay cuts.  5) Ford considers Halewood plant over Germany for EV systems: Ford is weighing up whether to build transmission systems for electric cars at its Halewood plant on Merseyside rather than at a site in Germany.  What happened overnight  Asian shares were on edge on Friday, hurt by persistent uncertainty around the fate of debt-ridden China Evergrande, even as more risk appetite drove gains for Wall Street and US benchmark Treasury yields.  MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan lost 0.1pc and was set for a weekly loss of 0.68pc. Australian shares fell 0.41pc, while the Hong Kong benchmark was mostly flat.  Japan's Nikkei rose 1.93pc, however, catching up on global gains after a public holiday. Chinese blue chips reversed early losses to gain 0.6pc after a cash injection from the central bank.  Investors continue to worry about the fate of property developer China Evergrande, which faces an interest payment deadline due Thursday. Its shares fell 5.2pc on Friday after bouncing 17.6pc a day earlier.  Coming up today  Economics: CBI retail sales survey (UK); new home sales (US)"

Turkey: macro-Financial situation  Paula Sánchez Pastor  ECONOMIC NOTES  Economic Bulletin  TURKEY: MACRO-FINANCIAL SITUATION  Paula Sánchez Pastor  4/2021  ABSTRACT  In 2021, the Turkish economy continued to be highly influenced by the course of the COVID-19   pandemic. Turkey has been more dynamic than other emerging economies since the start of the   pandemic, but faces a number of macro-financial challenges as a result of imbalances that have   become more acute during the crisis. These include, notably, high and persistent inflation, sizeable   external  financing  needs  (non-financial  corporations  have  high  levels  of  foreign  currency-  denominated  debt),  low  international  foreign  currency  reserves  and  growing  bank  deposit   dollarisation. The banking sector remains relatively sound and its NPL ratio has declined, although   some of its other indicators, such as profitability and solvency ratios, have slightly worsened.

BANCO DE ESPAÑA   3   ECONOMIC BULLETIN    TURKEY: MACRO-FINANCIAL SITUATION  The  author  of  this  article  is  Paula  Sánchez-Pastor  of  the  Directorate  General   Economics, Statistics and Research.  Introduction  Each year, the Banco de España identifies a list of countries outside the European   Union (EU) and the European Economic Area, known as “third countries”, that are   considered material for the Spanish banking system, on the basis of the volume and   regional distribution of its international credit exposures.  1   In accordance with the   guidance  provided  by  the  European  Systemic  Risk  Board  (ESRB),  2   Turkey is a   material  country  for  the  Spanish  banking  system  3   by virtue of BBVA Group’s   ownership  interest  in  the  Turkish  bank  Garanti  (49.85%  of  its  capital).  Garanti  is   Turkey’s second largest private bank, and the fifth largest bank if state-owned banks   are included. During the first half of 2021, Garanti accounted for 9.1% of total BBVA   Group assets, while its €384 million contribution to BBVA Group net profit represented   14.7%  of  total  profit  generated  by  the  Group’s  business  areas  as  a  whole  (€2.6   billion), excluding the corporate centre.  The  Spanish  and  Turkish  economies  are  also  linked  by  major  bilateral  trade  and   financial  flows  (see  Table  1).  With  regard  to  foreign  trade,  1.5%  of  total  Spanish   exports went to Turkey (the 10th non-euro area country behind Hungary) in 2019,   while the stock of foreign direct investment (FDI) that same year amounted to 1.1%   of total Spanish assets abroad (the 12th non-euro area country). Turkey is also a   material  third  country  for  the  overall  euro  area  and  EU  banking  systems,  4   and is   likewise relevant in terms of trade. The flow of exports from the euro area to Turkey   accounted for 1.3% of the total in 2019.  This note first analyses the economic and financial developments in Turkey during   2021 to date, which have been significantly influenced by the course and management   of the coronavirus pandemic, but also by its interaction with the economy’s pre-  1    This identification exercise is based on the Banco de España’s competence to set countercyclical capital buffer   rates for Spanish banking institutions according to their credit exposures to material third countries in response to   certain financial stability risks.

It subsequently examines the economic policies implemented   and ends with a review of the state of the banking system.  Economic and financial developments  Like  the  rest  of  the  world,  the  Turkish  economy  in  2021  continued  to  be  highly   influenced by the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. In March 2021, Turkey was hit   by a particularly severe third wave, in which the fatality rate reached its highest levels   since the start of the pandemic (see Chart 1). In order to curb the spread of COVID-19,   the authorities imposed fresh activity and personal mobility restrictions, such as the   strict 17-day confinement that began on 30 April. These measures were effective in   reducing infections, although a further rise in incidence has been apparent since   July, in parallel with developments at global level and the predominance of the Delta   variant. Vaccination commenced at a rapid pace in January 2021, although it soon   faced significant supply problems and slowed as a result. Once these problems had   been solved, vaccination accelerated again and, at 31 August, 56.7% of the Turkish   population had received at least one dose and 43.6% were fully vaccinated. These   rates were below the EU average but exceeded those in other emerging economies   (see Charts 1.3 and 1.4).

Growth was notably strong in the first half of the current year, with quarter-  on-quarter rates of 2.2% and 0.9% in Q1 and Q2, respectively (see Table 2). In June   and  July,  the  main  international  organisations  expected  growth  of  around  5.8%   overall in 2021,  5   in line with projections for the emerging economies and the world as   5    See the IMF’s Turkey: 2021 Article IV Consultation and the section on Turkey in the   OECD Economic Outlook   (2021, Issue 1).  A particularly severe third wave began in March 2021. This was brought under control, but a new upturn is apparent from July, in parallel with   the one in the advanced economies and despite the momentum achieved in the vaccination process.

However,   the latest data to emerge over the summer and the updated forecasts of various   analysts appear to suggest that these forecasts may be subject to significant upward   revisions, and the latest growth projections for 2021 are in the range of 8%-9%.   Despite the buoyancy of activity, the Turkish economy faces a number of challenges,   including,  notably,  high  inflation,  low  foreign  currency  reserves,  growing  deposit   dollarisation,  high  external  financing  needs  and  the  significant  foreign  currency   indebtedness of non-financial corporations to Turkish banks (see Charts 3.1 to 3.6).   These challenges largely arise from the imbalances that existed before the current   health crisis, although they have been exacerbated both by the impact of the crisis   itself and of the response to it (i.e. highly expansionary monetary and credit policies).  6  Also,  certain  institutional  decisions  have  generated  uncertainty  as  to  the   independence of Turkey’s monetary authority.  7   Specifically, the unexpected change   of governor at the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT)  8   in March 2021 led   6    See “Turkey: macro-financial situation” , Economic Notes,   Economic Bulletin,   1/2021, Banco de España  7    See the IMF’s Turkey: 2021 Article IV Consultation (pp. 13-16), and the section on Turkey (p. 192) of the 2021   Economic Reform Programmes of Albania, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia, Turkey, Bosnia and Herzegovina   and Kosovo*, Institutional paper 158 | July 2021, of the European Commission, and the section on Turkey in the   OECD Economic Outlook   (2021, issue 1).  8    In July 2018, the president gained the prerogative to directly appoint and dismiss the Governor and Deputy   Governor and members of the Monetary Policy Committee. CBRT Governors were subsequently dismissed in   July 2019, in November 2020 and again in March 2021.  In the ﬁrst half of 2021 the Turkish economy remained highly dynamic and it is very  likely that the IMF's growth forecast for the year as a   whole of 5.8% will be exceeded, as this rate (close to the average for the advanced and emerging economies) will be achieved simply as a   result of the carry-over effect from 2020 Q4.

(ii) the continuing low or negative interest rate environment in Switzerland and other jurisdictions,   developments in the macroeconomic climate and in the markets in which UBS operates or to which it is exposed, including   movements in securities prices or liquidity, credit spreads, and currency exchange rates, and the effects of economic   conditions, market developments, and geopolitical tensions on the financial position or creditworthiness of UBS’s clients and   counterparties as well as on client sentiment and levels of activity; (iii) changes in the availability of capital and funding,   including any changes in UBS’s credit spreads and ratings, as well as availability and cost of funding to meet requirements for   debt eligible for total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC); (iv) changes in or the implementation of financial legislation and   regulation in Switzerland, the US, the UK, the European Union and other financial centers that have imposed, or resulted in, or   may do so in the future, more stringent or entity-specific capital, TLAC, leverage ratio, liquidity and funding requirements,   incremental tax requirements, additional levies, limitations on permitted activities, constraints on remuneration, constraints on   transfers of capital and liquidity and sharing of operational costs across the Group or other measures, and the effect these will   or would have on UBS’s business activities; (v) the degree to which UBS is successful in implementing further changes to its   legal structure to improve its resolvability and meet related regulatory requirements and the potential need to make further   changes to the legal structure or booking model of UBS Group in response to legal and regulatory requirements, proposals in   Switzerland and other jurisdictions for mandatory structural reform of banks or systemically important institutions or to other   external developments, and the extent to which such changes will have the intended effects; (vi) UBS’s ability to maintain and   improve its systems and controls for the detection and prevention of money laundering and compliance with sanctions to meet   evolving regulatory requirements and expectations, in particular in the US; (vii) the uncertainty arising from the timing and   nature of the UK exit from the EU; (viii) changes in UBS’s competitive position, including whether differences in regulatory   capital and other requirements among the major financial centers will adversely affect UBS’s ability to compete in certain lines   of business; (ix) changes in the standards of conduct applicable to our businesses that may result from new regulation or new   enforcement of existing standards, including recently enacted and proposed measures to impose new and enhanced duties when   interacting with customers and in the execution and handling of customer transactions; (x) the liability to which UBS may be   exposed, or possible constraints or sanctions that regulatory authorities might impose on UBS, due to litigation, contractual   claims and regulatory investigations, including the potential for disqualification from certain businesses, potentially large fines   or monetary penalties, or the loss of licenses or privileges as a result of regulatory or other governmental sanctions, as well as   the effect that litigation, regulatory and similar matters have on the operational risk component of our RWA as well as the   amount of capital available for return to shareholders; (xi) the effects on UBS’s cross-border banking business of tax or   regulatory developments and of possible changes in UBS’s policies and practices relating to this business; (xii) UBS’s ability   to retain and attract the employees necessary to generate revenues and to manage, support and control its businesses, which   may be affected by competitive factors; (xiii) changes in accounting or tax standards or policies, and determinations or   interpretations affecting the recognition of gain or loss, the valuation of goodwill, the recognition of deferred tax assets and   other matters; (xiv) UBS’s ability to implement new technologies and business methods, including digital services and   technologies and ability to successfully compete with both existing and new financial service providers, some of which may   not be regulated to the same extent; (xv) limitations on the effectiveness of UBS’s internal processes for risk management, risk   control, measurement and modeling, and of financial models generally; (xvi) the occurrence of operational failures, such as   fraud, misconduct, unauthorized trading, financial crime, cyberattacks, and systems failures; (xvii) restrictions on the ability of   UBS Group AG to make payments or distributions, including due to restrictions on the ability of its subsidiaries to make loans   or distributions, directly or indirectly, or, in the case of financial difficulties, due to the exercise by FINMA or the regulators of   UBS’s operations in other countries of their broad statutory powers in relation to protective measures, restructuring and   liquidation proceedings; (xviii) the degree to which changes in regulation, capital or legal structure, financial results or other   factors may affect UBS’s ability to maintain its stated capital return objective; and (xix) the effect that these or other factors or   unanticipated events may have on our reputation and the additional consequences that this may have on our business and   performance. The sequence in which the factors above are presented is not indicative of their likelihood of occurrence or the   potential magnitude of their consequences. Our business and financial performance could be affected by other factors   identified in our past and future filings and reports, including those filed with the SEC. More detailed information about those   factors is set forth in documents furnished by UBS and filings made by UBS with the SEC.

Federal Insurance Contributions Act,The really scary news in the Social Security Trustees Report,The Hill | Home,The Hill,"The really scary news in the Social Security Trustees Report  The views expressed by contributors are their own and not the view of The Hill   The Social Security Trustees just released their annual report on the system’s finances. The news is awful. Most people know that the system’s future benefit promises are greater than its future payroll tax (FICA) revenues. But how big is the difference — its fiscal gap, also called its unfunded liability?  The answer – a terrifying $59.8 trillion – is buried deep in Appendix table VIF1. That’s over 2.5 times the size of the U.S. economy. Even more disturbing is the change since last year’s report. The system's debt grew by $6.8 trillion. In other words, Social Security ran a deficit equal to 30 percent of GDP. This is more than twice last year's $3.1 trillion official deficit. But unlike the change in official debt, Social Security's deficits are carefully kept off the books — for political, not economic reasons. Consequently, not a single media outlet we know of has reported these numbers.  The cause of Social Security’s massive increase in red ink? It’s not policy. Nothing’s changed there. Instead, it's less favorable long-run economic and demographic projections. But the source of Social Security's deficit doesn't make it any easier to handle. The current Social Security payroll tax is 12.4 percent, levied up to the maximum taxable earnings (now $142,800). Find-it-if-you-can table VIF1 says we need a 4.6 percentage point permanent increase in this rate, raising the Social Security FICA payroll tax to 17 percent, to pay Social Security benefits on an ongoing basis.   Go back to the 2011 Social Security Trustees Report and you'll find in table IVB6 that the system needed a 3.6 permanent percentage point tax hike to keep paying benefits through time. Hence, by this measure, Social Security's highly troubled finances have deteriorated by an additional 28 percent in just 10 years.  Unfortunately, Social Security’s fiscal shortfall is just part of our nation’s long-term insolvency. Official debt is now 100 percent of GDP. In 2007 it was 35 percent. Then there’s our out-of-control federal health care spending. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that Medicare, the Affordable Care Act and other federal health care outlays will rise from 5.7 percent of GDP to 9.4 percent of GDP over the next 30 years. Paying for just the Medicare part of this problem requires raising our current combined Social Security and Medicare 15.3 percent FICA tax to 22.4 percent today.  Yes, half of the FICA is the employer's share. But our bosses are lowering our net pay to cover what they need to send Uncle Sam on our behalf. Except for the politically driven bookkeeping, workers pay the entire FICA tax.  One can look at our fiscal debacle program by program. But what really matters is the overall picture. Fortunately, CBO’s long-term fiscal projections can be used to assess Uncle Sam’s overall fiscal gap — the present value of all projected federal outlays, including interest payments on official debt, less the present value of projected federal receipts. Hold your breath: The U.S. fiscal gap exceeds 10 years of GDP.  This figure is based on the government's preferred, but quite low interest rate for forming present values. With a higher and, arguably, more appropriate rate, the U.S. fiscal gap is dramatically smaller. But so is the present value of the future tax base needed to cover the gap. No matter what interest rate you use, the U.S. needs to immediately and permanently raise every federal tax by at least one third to pay, through time, for what our government plans to spend.  The alternative? Massive spending cuts. And, no, the Federal Reserve can’t make this problem go away by printing the money needed by the Treasury. This would end where it always does — in hyperinflation.  The size of the overall U.S. fiscal gap is unknown to Americans because neither political party wants to officially calculate it. But other countries routinely measure their fiscal gaps. Indeed, the European Union does so every three years in an extensive study of long-term fiscal sustainability. None of the major EU countries has anything close to the sustainability problem we face.   Herb Stein, President Nixon’s chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, famously said, “If something cannot go on forever, it will stop.” When it comes to America’s fiscal affairs, what can’t go on forever will stop too late, leaving our kids paying dramatically more in taxes and receiving dramatically less in benefits. This is fiscal child abuse, pure and simple.  Most people think our country is divided left and right. But that conflict is being hyped by politicians to hide the real war — the fiscal war they, with our adult consent, are waging and winning against our children.

False Claims Act,Productive finance working group publishes recommendations addressing the barriers to investment in less liquid assets,Bank of England | Latest News,Bank of England,"Productive finance working group publishes recommendations addressing the barriers to investment in less liquid assets  The Productive Finance Working Group has today published a series of recommendations which could facilitate greater investment in longer-term, less liquid assets.  News release  The Group is industry led, co-chaired by the Governor of the Bank, the Chief Executive of the FCA, and the Economic Secretary to HM Treasury.  Appropriately managed, investment in such assets has the potential to generate better returns for investors, including those saving for retirement in defined contribution (DC) pension schemes, given their typically long-term investment horizons. These types of pension schemes are an increasingly important vehicle for saving for retirement, given their assets have increased from around £200bn in 2012 to over £500bn today, and are expected to double to £1tn by 2030.  Investment in productive finance assets can also benefit the wider economy by supporting the economic recovery from Covid, facilitating the transition to a net zero economy and supporting financial stability. Greater investment in longer-term productive UK assets, such as research and development, technology, and infrastructure can provide a boost to long-term growth and support an innovative, greener future for the UK.  However there are a number of barriers and challenges to investment in less liquid assets and therefore these investment need to be carefully managed. The aim of the Group, convened in November 2020, was to propose solutions to such barriers, including a roadmap, timetable and set of actions.  In its report published today, ‘A Roadmap for Increasing Productive Finance Investment’, the Group has published four recommendations, underpinned by 13 specific actions, with a focus on supporting DC pension schemes to invest and developing the long-term asset fund (LTAF) structure.  The recommendations require action from industry and the official sector and will create an environment in which DC schemes and other investors can benefit from appropriate long-term opportunities. They include:  Shifting the focus to long-term value: DC schemes trustees, trade bodies and consultants should consider how increasing investment in less liquid assets could generate greater long-term value for their members.  Building scale: The DC market has a high proportion of small schemes. Their lack of scale can make it challenging for them to invest in less liquid assets for a variety of reasons.  A new approach to liquidity management: Most DC schemes currently invest predominantly in daily-dealing funds which in theory means their holdings can be sold at short notice. Investment in less liquid assets does not present the same daily dealing opportunity. Therefore a broader range of DC schemes should find ways to enable them to invest in less liquid assets as part of a diversified portfolio. To support that, the Group recommends industry develop guidance, in collaboration with the Bank and FCA, on good practices for liquidity management at a fund level.  Widening investment in less liquid assets: The group recommended that the FCA consult on changing its rules for investment in illiquid assets through unit-linked funds and reviewing the LTAF distribution rules to facilitate wider distribution to appropriate retail clients.  Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, said:  “Now is the time for institutional investors to seize the moment and invest in longer-term UK assets. By doing so they can help boost Britain’s long term growth, enable pensions savers to access better returns, and support an innovative, greener future for the UK.  “So it’s great that the industry working group have put forward proposals that will help to overcome the barriers to investing in long-term UK assets and I look forward to seeing them put into action.”  Andrew Bailey, Governor of the Bank of England, said:  “Addressing the investment barriers which exist for long-term assets can help unlock valuable economic opportunities. Carefully managed, this is especially important for people saving in their retirement and the broader economy. The input that the working group has provided over the past year in coming up with these recommendations should be commended and it is vital that they are implemented.”  Nikhil Rathi, Chief Executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, said:  “Defined contribution pension schemes have increased in importance over the past 10 years with increasing numbers of people using them to save for their retirement. Supporting access to different investment opportunities, which have the possibility to provide more diversified returns to members as well as benefiting the wider economy, is important. The working group produced a group of recommendations that could really make the difference and my colleagues and I at the FCA look forward to working with the industry and others to ensure they are implemented.  Notes to Editors  The final report, ‘A Roadmap for Increasing Productive Finance Investment’.  Further details on the Productive Finance Working Group, including Minutes from their meetings.  FCA CP21/12: A new authorised fund regime for investing in long term assets.  the work of the group has been welcomed by a number of industry participants:  Michael Moore, Director General of the BVCA, said:  “The Productive Finance Working Group is a hugely significant initiative. Not only is it encouraging collaboration and the sharing of perspectives from across the financial services sector, it’s also tackling the challenges faced by certain types of investor that are currently excluded from the impressive returns of private equity and venture capital funds.  “The BVCA welcomes its involvement in the group and the opportunity it has had to provide data and guidance on investing in this sector. We are confident that the group’s recommendations can help defined contribution pension schemes and other investors along the path towards allocating to our asset class. We look forward to supporting the group’s ongoing workstreams.”  Anne Richards, CEO of Fidelity International:  “We warmly welcome the steps being taken to increase the investment opportunities available to members of defined contribution schemes as we believe this could ultimately lead to better outcomes for long-term savers. Making it a reality will require collaboration from a policy, regulatory, tax, industry and wider stakeholder perspective and the recommendations made by the Productive Finance Working Group are an important step forward. We look forward to continuing to work together to achieve the best outcomes for our clients.”  Chris Hill, Chief Executive Officer, Hargreaves Lansdown, said:  “Over the last 18 months many have reassessed their finances and started to consider their plans for later life, with many investing for the first time to build their financial resilience. We are all responsible for our own retirements, so Hargreaves Lansdown particularly welcomes the recognition of the rights of retail investors and their importance to the UK economy in the report.  “When people have enough savings for emergencies and the time to invest for the long term, they should have the option to access these types of opportunities as part of their investment portfolio. Providing the right information to ensure investor knowledge and understanding of the risks of these new funds will be essential for their safe distribution.”  Chris Cummings, Chief Executive of the Investment Association said:  ""Investing in illiquid assets is a way for savers to diversify their portfolios and at the same time provide capital for long term projects which boost the economy. The Long-Term Asset Fund will offer DC pension schemes and certain retail investors a new way to access illiquid investments through a fund structure designed specifically for such investments.  “We welcome this report, in particular the work done by the Productive Finance Working Group to identify barriers to distributors offering funds with limited redemption opportunities and the commitment to look closely at allowing the LTAF to be sold to a broader range of retail investors with appropriate safeguards. We look forward to working with policy makers, investment managers, distributors and other organisations to take forward the report's recommendations to make the LTAF a success and increase the supply of productive finance in the UK economy.”  Ruston Smith, Chair of the Tesco Pension Fund, said:  “Many members in defined contribution schemes typically have long term time horizons and, in delivering good member outcomes, good quality illiquid assets can contribute towards improved diversification and future net risk adjusted returns. Other countries' DC schemes and UK DB schemes have, for some time, included appropriate allocations to private markets as part of their aim of delivering good member outcomes.  “Following the success of automatic enrolment, this initiative is incredibly important to further improve the incentive and accessibility of good quality illiquid assets for UK defined contribution schemes and their members. Further support from consultants and on trustee education, in this important area, will help provide good informed decisions and the further development of UK DC investment strategies.  John J. Haley, CEO, Willis Towers Watson  “Willis Towers Watson views the report produced by the Productive Finance Working Group as a critical step forward in getting more illiquid, productive investments into Defined Contribution schemes, thereby improving the investment outcomes for millions of Defined Contribution members in the UK; We are proud to have been an active participant in the project.  We recognise there remains work to be done in this area, and we look forward to continuing our work with other committed stakeholders to further improve the UK DC market.”"

ESMA clarifications  On 28 May 2021 and 16 July 2021, new questions on performance fees were added to the ESMA Q&As on UCITS and on AIFMs , to complete the Guidelines on performance fees in UCITS and certain types of AIFs (""Guidelines"") which ESMA had published on 5 December 2020 and in respect of which the CSSF confirmed, by way of its Circular 20/764 , the integration of those Guidelines into its administrative and regulatory practices.  The clarifications provided by ESMA through its Q&A in May and July 2021 notably concern:  the set-up of the reference period for performance fee models based on a benchmark index;  the set-up of the reference period in case of a merger where the receiving UCITS/AIF is a newly established fund with no performance history and is in effect a continuation of the merging UCITS/AIF;  the application of the Guidelines in the case of delegation of the portfolio management function to different delegated portfolio managers within the same sub-fund of a UCITS; and  the crystallisation of performance fees in case of creation of a new sub-fund/share class in an existing umbrella UCITS or AIF in the course of its financial year or in case of creation of a new UCITS/AIF.  2. Mandatory CSSF declaration for UCITS and regulated AIFs  By means of a press release dated 22 September 2021, the CSSF announces a new requirement for a performance fee declaration to be made as from 30 September 2021 on eDesk by IFMs for the Luxembourg regulated UCITS and AIFs they manage.  The declaration is to be made by Investment Fund Managers (""IFM"") with respect to UCITS and AIFs, including their sub-funds (""Funds"") by means of completing a predefined form on eDesk. For the avoidance of any doubt, the form also needs to be completed for AIFs which are out of scope of the ESMA Guidelines on performance fees applicable to UCITS and certain types of AIFs in order to declare that they are out of scope.  The form will be available as from 30 September 2021 for all Funds whose financial year is ending between July 2021 and December 2021. As from January 2022, the form will be requested for Funds whose financial year is ending between January 2022 and June 2022. The deadline for submission of the initial declaration will be at the latest before the corresponding closing date of each fund as further specified in the IFM's performance fee eDesk dashboard.  The form must also be completed in respect of Funds and sub-funds that are not subject to a performance fee. Funds that have not yet been launched since having been approved by the CSSF, or that became inactive following the full redemption of their shares or units (and then await reactivation) shall also make the declaration.  After the initial declaration and in case of changes (such as for example introduction of a performance fee for the first time after that date or changes in performance fee models), the IFM will also be responsible to ensure that performance fee declarations shall be kept up to date. According to the press release, a specific update function will be made available under the new eDesk module to send electronically any such changes in parallel to the transmission of the modified prospectus.  The Performance Fee declaration as well as subsequent updates must be completed and submitted by an eDesk user linked to the IFM. Delegations will in principle be possible.  The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter. Specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances."

But are they the real thing? Will they move markets? We have, with some reason, become inured to the disruptive headlines howling about threats to our way of life. Is there simply too much chaos out there to pick out the things which are really relevant from the noise? Our 24-hour news cycle is hardly helpful, is it? The talking heads, with practiced expressions of concern, seriousness of purpose and faux competence, serve up our daily quantum of fear and distress (Film at 11!). Don’t they seem almost gleeful to report yet another potential disaster? With breathy anxiety, designed to tug at our atavistic fight or flight instincts, they repurpose as news exaggeration, hyperbole, vague allegations, unconfirmed reports and sheer speculation.  The scary part is, of course, that buried and obscured in all that noise might be real news, things that investors and market participants really ought to be paying attention to because they will matter. The trick is sussing out the stuff that matters from the stuff that doesn’t.  So, we really do need to take into account these aspirational swans. One of them could be that figurative dead archduke.  Let’s take a stroll along the red carpet and chat up some of these swans.  Let’s start with our old friend, geopolitical disruption. Certainly, the ongoing horror show in Afghanistan is a thing. This adventure in grotesquery (there was virtually no risk, was there, that any of those helicopter pilots who evacuated the embassy back in August was ever going to land on the embassy roof, right?), it could have been something that moved markets and changed the calculus. But a black swan? Nope, not yet.  Well, then perhaps this sterling expression of American power and resolve might encourage adventurism around the world by the customary bad actors and such adventurism, or even credible threat of such adventurism, could roil markets. No one could have read about that “semi-official” Chinese news outlet publicly musing that the United States’ failure in Afghanistan should tell Taiwan that the jig is up without a frisson of anxiety. But a black swan? Nope, or at least not yet.  Then, of course, there’s the ongoing Covid mess which just refuses to follow the script of a good made-for-television movie. Started well. First, there would be a problem (check). Then our doughty heroes and heroines would engage in hard work and innovation to fix it (mostly check). Then the problem would be resolved. Throw in a car chase and a whiff of romance, roll credits, have a bit of a party and get back to work.  It didn’t happen, or at least it hasn’t happened yet. The plague goes on, the bug is still with us and looks like it might be indefinitely. Look, I’m not going to argue that life has not changed or is not still changing. Small business was and is particularly hard hit, but employment is up, GDP is growing and all the macro indicators are continuing to suggest expansion. There’s more of a feeling of momentum and a return to normalcy right now than something that has triggered fundamental change (check out any college football game this weekend). Doesn’t yet feel like a black swan.  For the moment, continuity wins and catastrophe stays in the Green Room.  How about the ultimate end (or not) of the vast amount of governmental largesse that has been rained on businesses and consumers (err…voters) for this past several years? It’s going to end at some point. Is its expiration a potential black swan?  The combined efforts of the current administration and the last, together with the Fed, moving mountains to avoid any possible threat of an economic downtown caused by a loss of liquidity, has been extraordinary. This has been an entirely unique fiscal and monetary adventure. We are literally off the charts. Here be dragons. The counterfactual is always the handmaiden of rank speculation, but assuming for a moment that all of that intervention, all that fiscal and monetary support had not happened, would we be in the economic wilderness today? We don’t know, but the economy is close to full employment, with moderate (transitory?) inflation and GDP almost fully recovered from the pandemic year. If, arguendo, all that financial support made a difference, what happens when it goes away? Are we back in the wilderness? Will the butcher’s bill come due?  While the occupants of the heights seem, at least publicly, confident that all this largess can be brought in for a soft landing, our track record of engineered soft landings is not, shall we say, sterling. If this Rube Goldberg-like complex of monetary and fiscal stimulus is not perfectly unwound, it’s hard to see how it won’t risk a significant economic disruption.  But it hasn’t happened yet. GFC 2.0 must still wait in the wings.  How about if it doesn’t all end any time soon? Want to talk about real inflation? Stagflation? All this fabulous stimulus and talk of a soft landing from the Covid mess certainly carries with it a significant risk of inflation. While many self-proclaimed experts continue to insist that inflation is transitory (because to admit otherwise is to admit our monetary posture might not be sustainable), there’s certainly evidence out there that it’s not. I get all the arguments about supply disruption, labor issues, material shortages, etc., but I’ll join the Milton Friedman team here and say that we can’t (or shouldn’t) ignore a vast increase in the money supply and a vast increase in liquidity occurring in a market without a concomitant increase in productivity and rapidly growing GDP and be comfortable that inflation is not lurking. Inflation or, God help us, stagflation, will impair value creation, drive up borrowing costs, dry up liquidity, destroy savings and strip any mojo from the economy and ultimately such continued excess itself will lead to a recession when someone finally goes all adult and does something about it (hard to see who that could be at this point).  Hard landing, recession; no landing, inflation, then recession. Are we acting like we’re about to spend time between Scylla and Charybdis? It sure doesn’t seem that way.  How about Mr. Biden’s gigantic combined infrastructure and “human infrastructure” (what a brilliant example of good word-smithing!) plans? Somewhere between $5 and $7 trillion of spending, and half of that or more in increased taxes over the next decade. Does that change the calculus? As I’m writing this, “who knows?” is about a precise an answer as I have heard about whether some or all of this passes and becomes law. Could the passage of some or all of this be the black swan we should be worrying about? Certainly, we’re not acting like it will be the sort of precipitating event which rapidly moves markets. Less a cliff and more of a boiled frog sort of thing? Maybe. But for the moment, along with geopolitical risk, and Covid, federal fiscal policy still seems to be a black swan wannabe.  Well, that’s all the obvious black swan nominees strutting the red carpet gussied up in their apocalyptic finery, but I have another one to consider, a bit stealthier and one that I actually think could, over time, change the calculus. That’s regulatory change. Oh boy.  Mr. Biden’s administration has a discernible progressive tilt these days, which has taken many by surprise since transformational change was not exactly the centerpiece of his return to normalcy campaign. But now? Talk is, of course, cheap, but the talk is pretty belligerent.  More regulation under Mr. Biden has always been in the cards.[1] For heaven’s sake, elections matter and the Democrats are in charge, a party with a congenital anxiety about, and indeed a certain hostility toward Wall Street, banking and finance. Couple that with a high level of confidence in the ability of government to make positive, important change, and you have the makings of a wave of significant regulatory action.  Remember people are policy. Look at the number of bona fide progressives who are taking seats in the administration. It’s pretty straightforward, isn’t it? How about the appointment of Barbara Roper to the SEC, or Lina Khan at FTC, and Mr. Gensler himself at the SEC? There’s Jared Bernstein at the Counsel of Economic Advisors and K. Sabeel Rahman at OIRA. Graham Steele to be Assistant Secretary of Financial Innovations and if Ms. Warren gets her way, Leal Brainard as the next Fed chair. All card-carrying progressives, all with an established track record of progressive views. There are no Robert Rubens or Lawrence Summers warming important seats in this administration.  Mr. Biden, right now, is trying to deliver a $5.5 trillion candy bowl budget of progressive policy goals, but he’s not likely to get everything he and Senators Sanders and Warren, et al, want. This will leave the progressive wing of the Democratic party seriously unhappy. That anger will have to be assuaged. What Mr. Biden will have in the toolbox to make progressives happy is broad and intrusive regulatory change. That’s the bone that must be thrown. (I note in passing that if the candy bowl is paired down with some Democrats’ complicit cooperation, it might be even worse. Nothing motivates the political animal as much as perceived apostates within its own caucus. The fire burns all the hotter for heretics and that will mean the regulatory action will have to be greater to serve an even more deeply annoyed progressive wing.)  When the White House goes looking for ideas for nifty regulatory change, there’s plenty to choose from. Take a look, if you would, at Senator Warren’s many articulated plans from the last presidential election cycle (and she is still at it…see her recent speechifying). Private debt is too high, banks shouldn’t be earning as much fee income, private equity is bad because it causes job losses, Glass Steagall should be restored and commercial banks fire-walled away from investment banking, executive compensation is too high and should be capped, there should be consequences for bank failures and financial disruptions and that means jail time for bankers, banks should understand that they have a societal obligation to provide leverage in some markets and deny it to others. That’s just a start.  And there are still goodies in the Basel IV goody bag and leftovers from Dodd-Frank, we’ll surely see the return of CECL and the full and aggressive implementation of the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book, the Net Stable Funding Ratio Rules and the Liquidity Ratio Rules which will all be used to reign in unfavored lending and investment. Some of the changes to the Volcker Rule adopted over the past four years might be reversed. There’s still more fun to be had with Pillar II. There’s the never resolved question of ratings agency reform and the possibility that the current SEC will embrace some sort of a rotation process among the main agencies, regardless of their competence, credit cultures or views of particular risks. That was one of the great bad ideas from Dodd-Frank but it’s still on the books; it’s still with us. Remember also that there was a notion in Dodd-Frank that perhaps the full panoply of public registration rules should be applied to all 144A transactions. How about that for good fun? Mr. Gensler was chatting up the Committee on Banking, House and Urban Affairs last week about SEC priorities and amongst them was issuer and underwriter disclosure in ABS. He mentioned in passing how enforcement and examinations must be more robust.  More disclosure, more compliance, the need to harvest more data, and more enforcement action. Moreover, regulations inevitably increase the level of risk aversion as folks worry that they are not meeting the dictate of their regulatory masters. In such an environment of higher costs and more risk aversion, lending activity will be torqued to meet administration goals and objectives.  Finally, ESG bears special mention. Whatever you think about its policy merits, ESG is going to be a can opener for a government trying to encourage investment in some aspects of the economy and discourage it in others. The existing budget identifies a lot of the winners (and by the process of exclusion, losers). Note that the European Union is actually considering risk weighting bank books to serve ESG goals. The prudential pressure to facilitate ESG goals and the pressure on the private fund community is enormous and while weather largely moves from west to east, regulatory enthusiasm seems to move from east to west and what’s happening in Europe is a harbinger of what may happen here. Perhaps you’ll love ESG’s winners. And why not? Mom and apple pie, right? But, the trouble with picking winners is that there will be losers. This focus on ESG will drive capital away from unfavored asset categories and I’m just saying, one of those is likely to be commercial real estate.  So, there are plenty of black swan wannabes out there, all of whom are flapping their little wings on the red carpet, none have taken flight, as evidenced by the fact that most macroeconomic indicators still point upward and certainly both the stock market and the debt markets are quiescent.  Just because we don’t have a winner in the black swan category just yet, does not, however, mean one shouldn’t prepare for when a bona fide black swan will strut down the red carpet. It’s going to happen soon, isn’t it? Come on, you know it is. Given the current state of play, it seems almost inevitable.  There are things that can be done, recognizing that disruptive change is more likely than not in the reasonably near future.  Thinking out loud, the following are all worth considering:  As a lender, don’t fight the tape. Embrace ESG opportunities. Embrace infrastructure. If the government makes it extraordinarily easy and lucrative to lend in the ESG infrastructure space while militating private risk through public intermediation, it’s time to lend there. Lend where the government leads.  As the regulatory burden increases (and this is dead nuts certain to occur) it will disproportionately impact the regulated banking community, creating competitive advantages to the alternate lending set and alternate lenders will provide an increasingly large share of credit to unloved (by the government) market sectors and that means, among other things, commercial real estate (will the non-banks continue to offer LIBOR next year and if so, what does that mean? A competitive advantage?). Continuing to raise money to deploy in the space is a good idea (though hardly an original one).  Many of our black swans are consistent with continued suppressed coupons. Alternately, if one of those black swans is inflation or stagflation, it’ll be inflation for the wrong reasons. It won’t be demand driven, it will be monetary excess. So even as rates rise, yield requirements will rise faster and we’ll continue to have a gap that needs to be managed between the needs and expectation of the users of capital and the providers of capital. Consequently, either way there will be sustained, ongoing demand for leverage through warehouses of various sorts and leverage through CLOs and CRE CLOs. Also true, in times like this, it’s a very good idea to broaden out your aven"
Fair Debt Collection Practices Act,"California DFPI Issues $375,000 Sanction Against Debt Collector",JD Supra | Finance & Banking Posts,JD Supra,"California DFPI Issues $375,000 Sanction Against Debt Collector  ​On September 22, 2021, the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) announced that it issued its first enforcement action against a debt collection company for various practices, including threatening to sue consumers and garnish wages, and for submitting negative information to credit bureaus without first providing required notice, in violation of the California Consumer Financial Protection Law (CCFPL).  Specifically, the DFPI found that from May through August 2021, the company violated the Rosenthal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (Rosenthal Act) by leaving consumers automated voicemails that failed to identify the company and made false representations about initiating legal proceedings​ and wage garnishments. DFPI also found that the company engaged in “debt parking” by furnishing negative credit information to credit bureaus without first attempting to communicate with consumers about the alleged debt or notify consumers in writing within 30 days of furnishing that negative credit information in violation of the Consumer Credit Reporting Agencies Act (CCRAA). Additionally, DFPI found that the company violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) by failing to provide certain disclosures within five days of its initial communication regarding the alleged debt, including the amount of debt, name of creditor, and notice that the consumer has 30 days to dispute the validity of the debt.  Under the CCFPL, a company that engages in offering or providing a consumer financial product or service to a resident of California may not engage in unlawful, unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices or commit any act in violation of a consumer financial law. The DFPI found that the company violated the CCFPL by engaging in the acts described above and issued a desist and refrain order against the company. The DFPI also ordered the company to pay an administrative penalty of $375,000.  In its press release, the DFPI also noted that as of September 1, all debt collectors are now able to apply to be licensed by the Department by submitting an online application with the Nationwide Multistate Licensing System (NMLS). Under the recently enacted Debt Collection Licensing Act (DCLA), all debt collectors must submit a license application prior to January 1, 2022 in order to continue operating in California next year."

Requested Exemptive Relief   1.  Applicants  request an exemption  from Section 15(c) of the Act to permit  the   Board,  1    including  the Independent  Board Members  2  ,   to approve an agreement (each a “Sub-  Advisory  Agreement”) pursuant to which  a sub-adviser  manages all  or a portion  of the assets of   one or more of the series, or a material  amendment thereto (a “Sub-Adviser  Change”), without   complying  with the in-person  meeting  requirement  of Section  15(c).  3    Under the requested relief,   the Independent  Board Members could  instead approve a Sub-Adviser  Change at a meeting  at   which members of the Board participate  by any means of communication  that allows  them to   hear each other simultaneously  during  the meeting.      2.  Applicants  request that the relief  apply  to Applicants,  as well as to any future   series of each Trust and any other existing  or future registered open-end  management investment   company  or series thereof that intends  to rely on the requested order in  the future and that: (i) is   advised  by the Adviser;  4     (ii)  uses the multi-manager  structure described in the application;  and   (iii)  complies  with  the terms and conditions  of the application  (each, a “Subadvised  Series”).  5  1     The term “Board” also includes the board of trustees or directors of a future Subadvised Series (as   defined below).     2     The term “Independent Board Members” means the members of the Board who are not parties to   the Sub-Advisory Agreement (as defined below), or “interested persons”, as defined in Section 2(a)(19)   of the Act, of any such party.     3     Applicants do not request relief that would permit the Board and the Independent Board Members   to approve renewals of Sub-Advisory Agreements at non-in-person meetings.     4     The term “Adviser” includes (i) the Adviser or its successors and (ii) any entity controlling,   controlled by, or under common control with, the Adviser or its successors. For the purposes of the   requested order, “successor” is limited to an entity resulting from a reorganization into another   jurisdiction or a change in the type of business organization.     5     All  registered open-end investment companies that currently intend to rely on the requested order   are named as applicants.  Any entity that relies on the requested order will do so only in accordance with   the terms and conditions contained in the application.     4   II.  Management of the Subadvised Series   3.  The Adviser will  serve as the investment  adviser to each Subadvised  Series   pursuant to an investment  advisory  agreement with each Trust (each an “Investment   Management Agreement”).  The Adviser,  subject to the oversight  of the Board, will  provide   continuous  investment  management  services to each Subadvised  Series.  Applicants  are not   seeking  an exemption  from the Act with respect to the Investment Management  Agreements.    4.  Applicants  state that the Subadvised  Series may seek to provide  exposure to   multiple  strategies across various  asset classes, thus allowing  investors  to more easily  access   such strategies without  the additional  transaction  costs and administrative  burdens  of investing  in   multiple  funds to seek to achieve comparable exposures.     5.  To that end, the Adviser may achieve its desired exposures to specific  strategies   by allocating  discrete portions  of the Subadvised  Series’ assets to various  sub-advisers.    Consistent  with  the terms of each Investment  Management Agreement and subject  to the Board’s   approval,  6     the Adviser would  delegate management  of all  or a portion  of the assets of a   Subadvised  Series to a sub-adviser.  7     Each sub-adviser would  be an “investment  adviser” to the   Subadvised  Series within  the meaning  of Section  2(a)(20) of the Act.  8    The Adviser  would  retain   6     A Sub-Advisory Agreement may also be subject to approval by a Subadvised Series’   shareholders.  Applicants currently rely on a multi-manager exemptive order to enter into and materially   amend Sub-Advisory Agreements without obtaining shareholder approval.    See   Delaware Management   Business Trust, et al., Investment Company Act Release Nos. 32395 (Dec. 19, 2016) (notice) and 32423   (Jan. 17, 2017) (order).     7     A sub-adviser may manage the assets of a Subadvised Series directly or provide the Adviser with   model portfolio or investment recommendation(s) that would be utilized in connection with the   management of a Subadvised Series.     8     Each sub-adviser would be registered with the Commission as an investment adviser under the   Advisers Act or not subject to such registration.     5   overall  responsibility  for the management  and investment  of the assets of each Subadvised   Series.     III. Applicable Law   6.  Section  15(c) of the Act prohibits  a registered investment  company  having  a   board from entering  into,  renewing or performing  any contract or agreement whereby a person   undertakes regularly  to act as an investment  adviser (including  a sub-adviser)  to the investment   company,  unless  the terms of such contract or agreement and any renewal thereof have been   approved  by the vote of a majority  of the investment  company’s  board members who are not   parties to such contract or agreement, or interested persons of any such party,  cast in person at a   meeting  called  for the purpose of voting  on such approval.     7.  Section  6(c) of the Act provides  that the Commission  may exempt any person,   security,  or transaction  or any class or classes of persons,  securities,  or transactions from any   provisions  of the Act, or any rule thereunder,  if such exemption  is necessary or appropriate  in  the   public  interest and consistent with  the protection  of investors  and the purposes fairly  intended  by   the policy  and provisions  of the Act.  Applicants  state that the requested relief meets this   standard for the reasons discussed below.     IV. Arguments in Support of the Requested Relief   8.  Applicants  assert that boards of registered investment  companies,  including  the   Board, typically  hold  in-person  meetings  on a quarterly  basis.  Applicants  state that during  the   three to four month  period  between board meeting  dates, market conditions  may change or   investment  opportunities  may arise such that the Adviser may wish to make a Sub-Adviser   Change.  Applicants  also state that at these moments  it may be impractical,  and/or costly to hold   6   an additional  in-person  Board meeting,  especially  given  the geographic  diversity  of Board   members and the additional  cost of holding  in-person  meetings.     9.  As a result,  Applicants  believe  that the requested relief would  allow  the   Subadvised  Series to operate more efficiently.  In particular,  Applicants  assert that without  the   delay inherent  in  holding  in-person  Board meetings  (and the attendant difficulty  of obtaining  the   necessary quorum  for, and the additional  costs of, an unscheduled  in-person  Board meeting),  the   Subadvised  Series would  be able to act quicker  and with less expense to add or replace sub-  advisers when the Board and the Adviser believe  that a Sub-Adviser  Change would  benefit  the   Subadvised  Series.     10.  Applicants  also note that the in-person  meeting  requirement  in  Section 15(c) of   the Act was designed  to prohibit  absentee approval  of advisory  agreements.  Applicants  state that   condition  1 to the requested relief  is designed  to avoid  such absentee approval  by requiring  that   the Board approve  a Sub-Adviser  Change at a meeting  where all participating  Board members   can hear each other and be heard by each other during  the meeting.  9  11.  Applicants,  moreover,  represent that the Board would  conduct any such non-in-  person consideration  of a Sub-Advisory  Agreement in  accordance with its typical  process for   approving  Sub-Advisory  Agreements.  Consistent  with  Section 15(c) of the Act, the Board   would  request and evaluate such information  as may reasonably  be necessary to evaluate the   terms of any Sub-Advisory  Agreement, and the Adviser  and sub-adviser  would  provide  such   information.     9     Applicants state that technology that includes visual capabilities will be used unless unanticipated   circumstances arise.  Applicants also state that the Board could not rely upon the relief to approve a Sub-Advisory   Agreement by written consent or another form of absentee approval by the Board.       7   12.  Finally,  Applicants  note that if one or more Board members request that a Sub-  Adviser Change be considered in-person,  then the Board would  not be able to rely on the relief   and would  have to consider  the Sub-Adviser  Change at an in-person  meeting.     V. Applicants’ Conditions       Applicants  agree that any order granting  the requested relief will  be subject  to the   following  conditions:   1.  The Independent  Board Members will  approve the Sub-Adviser  Change at a non-  in-person  meeting  in  which Board members may participate  by any means of communication   that allows  those Board members participating  to hear each other simultaneously  during  the   meeting.      2.  Management will  represent that the materials  provided  to the Board for the non-  in-person  meeting  include  the same information  the Board would  have received if a Sub-Adviser   Change were sought at an in-person  Board meeting.     3.  The notice of the non-in-person  meeting  will  explain  the need for considering  the   Sub-Adviser  Change at a non-in-person  meeting.   Once notice of the non-in-person  meeting  to   consider  a Sub-Adviser  Change is sent, Board members will  be given  the opportunity  to object to   considering  the Sub-Adviser  Change at a non-in-person  Board meeting.   If a Board member   requests that the Sub-Adviser  Change be considered  in-person,  the Board will  consider the Sub-  Adviser Change at an in-person  meeting,  unless such request is rescinded.     4.  A Subadvised  Series’ ability  to rely on the requested relief will  be disclosed  in  the   Subadvised  Series’ registration  statement.     8   5.  In the event that the Commission  adopts a rule under the Act providing   substantially  similar  relief to that in the order requested in  the application,  the requested order   will  expire on the effective date of that rule.       For the Commission,  by the Division  of Investment Management,  under delegated   authority.     J. Matthew DeLesDernier   Assistant Secretary     "

The Emmys were last week and weirdly, I got a thought bubble about nominees in the Black Swan category, walking the red carpet looking for attention! Think the Masquerade scene from Phantom of the Opera when the Phantom comes prancing down the stairs to harsh the festivities (at least he sang well).  We have some obvious nominees today. But are they the real thing? Will they move markets? We have, with some reason, become inured to the disruptive headlines howling about threats to our way of life. Is there simply too much chaos out there to pick out the things which are really relevant from the noise? Our 24-hour news cycle is hardly helpful, is it? The talking heads, with practiced expressions of concern, seriousness of purpose and faux competence, serve up our daily quantum of fear and distress (Film at 11!). Don’t they seem almost gleeful to report yet another potential disaster? With breathy anxiety, designed to tug at our atavistic fight or flight instincts, they repurpose as news exaggeration, hyperbole, vague allegations, unconfirmed reports and sheer speculation.  The scary part is, of course, that buried and obscured in all that noise might be real news, things that investors and market participants really ought to be paying attention to because they will matter. The trick is sussing out the stuff that matters from the stuff that doesn’t.  So, we really do need to take into account these aspirational swans. One of them could be that figurative dead archduke.  Let’s take a stroll along the red carpet and chat up some of these swans.  Let’s start with our old friend, geopolitical disruption. Certainly, the ongoing horror show in Afghanistan is a thing. This adventure in grotesquery (there was virtually no risk, was there, that any of those helicopter pilots who evacuated the embassy back in August was ever going to land on the embassy roof, right?), it could have been something that moved markets and changed the calculus. But a black swan? Nope, not yet.  Well, then perhaps this sterling expression of American power and resolve might encourage adventurism around the world by the customary bad actors and such adventurism, or even credible threat of such adventurism, could roil markets. No one could have read about that “semi-official” Chinese news outlet publicly musing that the United States’ failure in Afghanistan should tell Taiwan that the jig is up without a frisson of anxiety. But a black swan? Nope, or at least not yet.  Then, of course, there’s the ongoing Covid mess which just refuses to follow the script of a good made-for-television movie. Started well. First, there would be a problem (check). Then our doughty heroes and heroines would engage in hard work and innovation to fix it (mostly check). Then the problem would be resolved. Throw in a car chase and a whiff of romance, roll credits, have a bit of a party and get back to work.  It didn’t happen, or at least it hasn’t happened yet. The plague goes on, the bug is still with us and looks like it might be indefinitely. Look, I’m not going to argue that life has not changed or is not still changing. Small business was and is particularly hard hit, but employment is up, GDP is growing and all the macro indicators are continuing to suggest expansion. There’s more of a feeling of momentum and a return to normalcy right now than something that has triggered fundamental change (check out any college football game this weekend). Doesn’t yet feel like a black swan.  For the moment, continuity wins and catastrophe stays in the Green Room.  How about the ultimate end (or not) of the vast amount of governmental largesse that has been rained on businesses and consumers (err…voters) for this past several years? It’s going to end at some point. Is its expiration a potential black swan?  The combined efforts of the current administration and the last, together with the Fed, moving mountains to avoid any possible threat of an economic downtown caused by a loss of liquidity, has been extraordinary. This has been an entirely unique fiscal and monetary adventure. We are literally off the charts. Here be dragons. The counterfactual is always the handmaiden of rank speculation, but assuming for a moment that all of that intervention, all that fiscal and monetary support had not happened, would we be in the economic wilderness today? We don’t know, but the economy is close to full employment, with moderate (transitory?) inflation and GDP almost fully recovered from the pandemic year. If, arguendo, all that financial support made a difference, what happens when it goes away? Are we back in the wilderness? Will the butcher’s bill come due?  While the occupants of the heights seem, at least publicly, confident that all this largess can be brought in for a soft landing, our track record of engineered soft landings is not, shall we say, sterling. If this Rube Goldberg-like complex of monetary and fiscal stimulus is not perfectly unwound, it’s hard to see how it won’t risk a significant economic disruption.  But it hasn’t happened yet. GFC 2.0 must still wait in the wings.  How about if it doesn’t all end any time soon? Want to talk about real inflation? Stagflation? All this fabulous stimulus and talk of a soft landing from the Covid mess certainly carries with it a significant risk of inflation. While many self-proclaimed experts continue to insist that inflation is transitory (because to admit otherwise is to admit our monetary posture might not be sustainable), there’s certainly evidence out there that it’s not. I get all the arguments about supply disruption, labor issues, material shortages, etc., but I’ll join the Milton Friedman team here and say that we can’t (or shouldn’t) ignore a vast increase in the money supply and a vast increase in liquidity occurring in a market without a concomitant increase in productivity and rapidly growing GDP and be comfortable that inflation is not lurking. Inflation or, God help us, stagflation, will impair value creation, drive up borrowing costs, dry up liquidity, destroy savings and strip any mojo from the economy and ultimately such continued excess itself will lead to a recession when someone finally goes all adult and does something about it (hard to see who that could be at this point).  Hard landing, recession; no landing, inflation, then recession. Are we acting like we’re about to spend time between Scylla and Charybdis? It sure doesn’t seem that way.  How about Mr. Biden’s gigantic combined infrastructure and “human infrastructure” (what a brilliant example of good word-smithing!) plans? Somewhere between $5 and $7 trillion of spending, and half of that or more in increased taxes over the next decade. Does that change the calculus? As I’m writing this, “who knows?” is about a precise an answer as I have heard about whether some or all of this passes and becomes law. Could the passage of some or all of this be the black swan we should be worrying about? Certainly, we’re not acting like it will be the sort of precipitating event which rapidly moves markets. Less a cliff and more of a boiled frog sort of thing? Maybe. But for the moment, along with geopolitical risk, and Covid, federal fiscal policy still seems to be a black swan wannabe.  Well, that’s all the obvious black swan nominees strutting the red carpet gussied up in their apocalyptic finery, but I have another one to consider, a bit stealthier and one that I actually think could, over time, change the calculus. That’s regulatory change. Oh boy.  Mr. Biden’s administration has a discernible progressive tilt these days, which has taken many by surprise since transformational change was not exactly the centerpiece of his return to normalcy campaign. But now? Talk is, of course, cheap, but the talk is pretty belligerent.  More regulation under Mr. Biden has always been in the cards.[1] For heaven’s sake, elections matter and the Democrats are in charge, a party with a congenital anxiety about, and indeed a certain hostility toward Wall Street, banking and finance. Couple that with a high level of confidence in the ability of government to make positive, important change, and you have the makings of a wave of significant regulatory action.  Remember people are policy. Look at the number of bona fide progressives who are taking seats in the administration. It’s pretty straightforward, isn’t it? How about the appointment of Barbara Roper to the SEC, or Lina Khan at FTC, and Mr. Gensler himself at the SEC? There’s Jared Bernstein at the Counsel of Economic Advisors and K. Sabeel Rahman at OIRA. Graham Steele to be Assistant Secretary of Financial Innovations and if Ms. Warren gets her way, Leal Brainard as the next Fed chair. All card-carrying progressives, all with an established track record of progressive views. There are no Robert Rubens or Lawrence Summers warming important seats in this administration.  Mr. Biden, right now, is trying to deliver a $5.5 trillion candy bowl budget of progressive policy goals, but he’s not likely to get everything he and Senators Sanders and Warren, et al, want. This will leave the progressive wing of the Democratic party seriously unhappy. That anger will have to be assuaged. What Mr. Biden will have in the toolbox to make progressives happy is broad and intrusive regulatory change. That’s the bone that must be thrown. (I note in passing that if the candy bowl is paired down with some Democrats’ complicit cooperation, it might be even worse. Nothing motivates the political animal as much as perceived apostates within its own caucus. The fire burns all the hotter for heretics and that will mean the regulatory action will have to be greater to serve an even more deeply annoyed progressive wing.)  When the White House goes looking for ideas for nifty regulatory change, there’s plenty to choose from. Take a look, if you would, at Senator Warren’s many articulated plans from the last presidential election cycle (and she is still at it…see her recent speechifying). Private debt is too high, banks shouldn’t be earning as much fee income, private equity is bad because it causes job losses, Glass Steagall should be restored and commercial banks fire-walled away from investment banking, executive compensation is too high and should be capped, there should be consequences for bank failures and financial disruptions and that means jail time for bankers, banks should understand that they have a societal obligation to provide leverage in some markets and deny it to others. That’s just a start.  And there are still goodies in the Basel IV goody bag and leftovers from Dodd-Frank, we’ll surely see the return of CECL and the full and aggressive implementation of the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book, the Net Stable Funding Ratio Rules and the Liquidity Ratio Rules which will all be used to reign in unfavored lending and investment. Some of the changes to the Volcker Rule adopted over the past four years might be reversed. There’s still more fun to be had with Pillar II. There’s the never resolved question of ratings agency reform and the possibility that the current SEC will embrace some sort of a rotation process among the main agencies, regardless of their competence, credit cultures or views of particular risks. That was one of the great bad ideas from Dodd-Frank but it’s still on the books; it’s still with us. Remember also that there was a notion in Dodd-Frank that perhaps the full panoply of public registration rules should be applied to all 144A transactions. How about that for good fun? Mr. Gensler was chatting up the Committee on Banking, House and Urban Affairs last week about SEC priorities and amongst them was issuer and underwriter disclosure in ABS. He mentioned in passing how enforcement and examinations must be more robust.  More disclosure, more compliance, the need to harvest more data, and more enforcement action. Moreover, regulations inevitably increase the level of risk aversion as folks worry that they are not meeting the dictate of their regulatory masters. In such an environment of higher costs and more risk aversion, lending activity will be torqued to meet administration goals and objectives.  Finally, ESG bears special mention. Whatever you think about its policy merits, ESG is going to be a can opener for a government trying to encourage investment in some aspects of the economy and discourage it in others. The existing budget identifies a lot of the winners (and by the process of exclusion, losers). Note that the European Union is actually considering risk weighting bank books to serve ESG goals. The prudential pressure to facilitate ESG goals and the pressure on the private fund community is enormous and while weather largely moves from west to east, regulatory enthusiasm seems to move from east to west and what’s happening in Europe is a harbinger of what may happen here. Perhaps you’ll love ESG’s winners. And why not? Mom and apple pie, right? But, the trouble with picking winners is that there will be losers. This focus on ESG will drive capital away from unfavored asset categories and I’m just saying, one of those is likely to be commercial real estate.  So, there are plenty of black swan wannabes out there, all of whom are flapping their little wings on the red carpet, none have taken flight, as evidenced by the fact that most macroeconomic indicators still point upward and certainly both the stock market and the debt markets are quiescent.  Just because we don’t have a winner in the black swan category just yet, does not, however, mean one shouldn’t prepare for when a bona fide black swan will strut down the red carpet. It’s going to happen soon, isn’t it? Come on, you know it is. Given the current state of play, it seems almost inevitable.  There are things that can be done, recognizing that disruptive change is more likely than not in the reasonably near future.  Thinking out loud, the following are all worth considering:  As a lender, don’t fight the tape. Embrace ESG opportunities. Embrace infrastructure. If the government makes it extraordinarily easy and lucrative to lend in the ESG infrastructure space while militating private risk through public intermediation, it’s time to lend there. Lend where the government leads.  As the regulatory burden increases (and this is dead nuts certain to occur) it will disproportionately impact the regulated banking community, creating competitive advantages to the alternate lending set and alternate lenders will provide an increasingly large share of credit to unloved (by the government) market sectors and that means, among other things, commercial real estate (will the non-banks continue to offer LIBOR next year and if so, what does that mean? A competitive advantage?). Continuing to raise money to deploy in the space is a good idea (though hardly an original one).  Many of our black swans are consistent with continued suppressed coupons. Alternately, if one of those black swans is inflation or stagflation, it’ll be inflation for the wrong reasons. It won’t be demand driven, it will be monetary excess. So even as rates rise, yield requirements will rise faster and we’ll continue to have a gap that needs to be managed between the needs and expectation of the users of capital and the providers of capital. Consequently, either way there will be sustained, ongoing demand for leverage through warehouses of various sorts and leverage through CLOs and CRE CLOs. Also true, in times like this, it’s a very good idea to broaden out your aven"

While many self-proclaimed experts continue to insist that inflation is transitory (because to admit otherwise is to admit our monetary posture might not be sustainable), there’s certainly evidence out there that it’s not. I get all the arguments about supply disruption, labor issues, material shortages, etc., but I’ll join the Milton Friedman team here and say that we can’t (or shouldn’t) ignore a vast increase in the money supply and a vast increase in liquidity occurring in a market without a concomitant increase in productivity and rapidly growing GDP and be comfortable that inflation is not lurking. Inflation or, God help us, stagflation, will impair value creation, drive up borrowing costs, dry up liquidity, destroy savings and strip any mojo from the economy and ultimately such continued excess itself will lead to a recession when someone finally goes all adult and does something about it (hard to see who that could be at this point).  Hard landing, recession; no landing, inflation, then recession. Are we acting like we’re about to spend time between Scylla and Charybdis? It sure doesn’t seem that way.  How about Mr. Biden’s gigantic combined infrastructure and “human infrastructure” (what a brilliant example of good word-smithing!) plans? Somewhere between $5 and $7 trillion of spending, and half of that or more in increased taxes over the next decade. Does that change the calculus? As I’m writing this, “who knows?” is about a precise an answer as I have heard about whether some or all of this passes and becomes law. Could the passage of some or all of this be the black swan we should be worrying about? Certainly, we’re not acting like it will be the sort of precipitating event which rapidly moves markets. Less a cliff and more of a boiled frog sort of thing? Maybe. But for the moment, along with geopolitical risk, and Covid, federal fiscal policy still seems to be a black swan wannabe.  Well, that’s all the obvious black swan nominees strutting the red carpet gussied up in their apocalyptic finery, but I have another one to consider, a bit stealthier and one that I actually think could, over time, change the calculus. That’s regulatory change. Oh boy.  Mr. Biden’s administration has a discernible progressive tilt these days, which has taken many by surprise since transformational change was not exactly the centerpiece of his return to normalcy campaign. But now? Talk is, of course, cheap, but the talk is pretty belligerent.  More regulation under Mr. Biden has always been in the cards.[1] For heaven’s sake, elections matter and the Democrats are in charge, a party with a congenital anxiety about, and indeed a certain hostility toward Wall Street, banking and finance. Couple that with a high level of confidence in the ability of government to make positive, important change, and you have the makings of a wave of significant regulatory action.  Remember people are policy. Look at the number of bona fide progressives who are taking seats in the administration. It’s pretty straightforward, isn’t it? How about the appointment of Barbara Roper to the SEC, or Lina Khan at FTC, and Mr. Gensler himself at the SEC? There’s Jared Bernstein at the Counsel of Economic Advisors and K. Sabeel Rahman at OIRA. Graham Steele to be Assistant Secretary of Financial Innovations and if Ms. Warren gets her way, Leal Brainard as the next Fed chair. All card-carrying progressives, all with an established track record of progressive views. There are no Robert Rubens or Lawrence Summers warming important seats in this administration.  Mr. Biden, right now, is trying to deliver a $5.5 trillion candy bowl budget of progressive policy goals, but he’s not likely to get everything he and Senators Sanders and Warren, et al, want. This will leave the progressive wing of the Democratic party seriously unhappy. That anger will have to be assuaged. What Mr. Biden will have in the toolbox to make progressives happy is broad and intrusive regulatory change. That’s the bone that must be thrown. (I note in passing that if the candy bowl is paired down with some Democrats’ complicit cooperation, it might be even worse. Nothing motivates the political animal as much as perceived apostates within its own caucus. The fire burns all the hotter for heretics and that will mean the regulatory action will have to be greater to serve an even more deeply annoyed progressive wing.)  When the White House goes looking for ideas for nifty regulatory change, there’s plenty to choose from. Take a look, if you would, at Senator Warren’s many articulated plans from the last presidential election cycle (and she is still at it…see her recent speechifying). Private debt is too high, banks shouldn’t be earning as much fee income, private equity is bad because it causes job losses, Glass Steagall should be restored and commercial banks fire-walled away from investment banking, executive compensation is too high and should be capped, there should be consequences for bank failures and financial disruptions and that means jail time for bankers, banks should understand that they have a societal obligation to provide leverage in some markets and deny it to others. That’s just a start.  And there are still goodies in the Basel IV goody bag and leftovers from Dodd-Frank, we’ll surely see the return of CECL and the full and aggressive implementation of the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book, the Net Stable Funding Ratio Rules and the Liquidity Ratio Rules which will all be used to reign in unfavored lending and investment. Some of the changes to the Volcker Rule adopted over the past four years might be reversed. There’s still more fun to be had with Pillar II. There’s the never resolved question of ratings agency reform and the possibility that the current SEC will embrace some sort of a rotation process among the main agencies, regardless of their competence, credit cultures or views of particular risks. That was one of the great bad ideas from Dodd-Frank but it’s still on the books; it’s still with us. Remember also that there was a notion in Dodd-Frank that perhaps the full panoply of public registration rules should be applied to all 144A transactions. How about that for good fun? Mr. Gensler was chatting up the Committee on Banking, House and Urban Affairs last week about SEC priorities and amongst them was issuer and underwriter disclosure in ABS. He mentioned in passing how enforcement and examinations must be more robust.  More disclosure, more compliance, the need to harvest more data, and more enforcement action. Moreover, regulations inevitably increase the level of risk aversion as folks worry that they are not meeting the dictate of their regulatory masters. In such an environment of higher costs and more risk aversion, lending activity will be torqued to meet administration goals and objectives.  Finally, ESG bears special mention. Whatever you think about its policy merits, ESG is going to be a can opener for a government trying to encourage investment in some aspects of the economy and discourage it in others. The existing budget identifies a lot of the winners (and by the process of exclusion, losers). Note that the European Union is actually considering risk weighting bank books to serve ESG goals. The prudential pressure to facilitate ESG goals and the pressure on the private fund community is enormous and while weather largely moves from west to east, regulatory enthusiasm seems to move from east to west and what’s happening in Europe is a harbinger of what may happen here. Perhaps you’ll love ESG’s winners. And why not? Mom and apple pie, right? But, the trouble with picking winners is that there will be losers. This focus on ESG will drive capital away from unfavored asset categories and I’m just saying, one of those is likely to be commercial real estate.  So, there are plenty of black swan wannabes out there, all of whom are flapping their little wings on the red carpet, none have taken flight, as evidenced by the fact that most macroeconomic indicators still point upward and certainly both the stock market and the debt markets are quiescent.  Just because we don’t have a winner in the black swan category just yet, does not, however, mean one shouldn’t prepare for when a bona fide black swan will strut down the red carpet. It’s going to happen soon, isn’t it? Come on, you know it is. Given the current state of play, it seems almost inevitable.  There are things that can be done, recognizing that disruptive change is more likely than not in the reasonably near future.  Thinking out loud, the following are all worth considering:  As a lender, don’t fight the tape. Embrace ESG opportunities. Embrace infrastructure. If the government makes it extraordinarily easy and lucrative to lend in the ESG infrastructure space while militating private risk through public intermediation, it’s time to lend there. Lend where the government leads.  As the regulatory burden increases (and this is dead nuts certain to occur) it will disproportionately impact the regulated banking community, creating competitive advantages to the alternate lending set and alternate lenders will provide an increasingly large share of credit to unloved (by the government) market sectors and that means, among other things, commercial real estate (will the non-banks continue to offer LIBOR next year and if so, what does that mean? A competitive advantage?). Continuing to raise money to deploy in the space is a good idea (though hardly an original one).  Many of our black swans are consistent with continued suppressed coupons. Alternately, if one of those black swans is inflation or stagflation, it’ll be inflation for the wrong reasons. It won’t be demand driven, it will be monetary excess. So even as rates rise, yield requirements will rise faster and we’ll continue to have a gap that needs to be managed between the needs and expectation of the users of capital and the providers of capital. Consequently, either way there will be sustained, ongoing demand for leverage through warehouses of various sorts and leverage through CLOs and CRE CLOs. Also true, in times like this, it’s a very good idea to broaden out your avenu"
Fair Debt Collection Practices Act,"California DFPI Issues $375,000 Sanction Against Debt Collector",JD Supra All Legal Alerts,JD Supra,"California DFPI Issues $375,000 Sanction Against Debt Collector  ​On September 22, 2021, the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) announced that it issued its first enforcement action against a debt collection company for various practices, including threatening to sue consumers and garnish wages, and for submitting negative information to credit bureaus without first providing required notice, in violation of the California Consumer Financial Protection Law (CCFPL).  Specifically, the DFPI found that from May through August 2021, the company violated the Rosenthal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (Rosenthal Act) by leaving consumers automated voicemails that failed to identify the company and made false representations about initiating legal proceedings​ and wage garnishments. DFPI also found that the company engaged in “debt parking” by furnishing negative credit information to credit bureaus without first attempting to communicate with consumers about the alleged debt or notify consumers in writing within 30 days of furnishing that negative credit information in violation of the Consumer Credit Reporting Agencies Act (CCRAA). Additionally, DFPI found that the company violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) by failing to provide certain disclosures within five days of its initial communication regarding the alleged debt, including the amount of debt, name of creditor, and notice that the consumer has 30 days to dispute the validity of the debt.  Under the CCFPL, a company that engages in offering or providing a consumer financial product or service to a resident of California may not engage in unlawful, unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices or commit any act in violation of a consumer financial law. The DFPI found that the company violated the CCFPL by engaging in the acts described above and issued a desist and refrain order against the company. The DFPI also ordered the company to pay an administrative penalty of $375,000.  In its press release, the DFPI also noted that as of September 1, all debt collectors are now able to apply to be licensed by the Department by submitting an online application with the Nationwide Multistate Licensing System (NMLS). Under the recently enacted Debt Collection Licensing Act (DCLA), all debt collectors must submit a license application prior to January 1, 2022 in order to continue operating in California next year."
Basel IV,Does A Red Carpet Full Of Black Swans Matter?,JD Supra All Legal Alerts,JD Supra,"Does A Red Carpet Full Of Black Swans Matter?  It’s coming up on awards season. The Emmys were last week and weirdly, I got a thought bubble about nominees in the Black Swan category, walking the red carpet looking for attention! Think the Masquerade scene from Phantom of the Opera when the Phantom comes prancing down the stairs to harsh the festivities (at least he sang well).  We have some obvious nominees today. But are they the real thing? Will they move markets? We have, with some reason, become inured to the disruptive headlines howling about threats to our way of life. Is there simply too much chaos out there to pick out the things which are really relevant from the noise? Our 24-hour news cycle is hardly helpful, is it? The talking heads, with practiced expressions of concern, seriousness of purpose and faux competence, serve up our daily quantum of fear and distress (Film at 11!). Don’t they seem almost gleeful to report yet another potential disaster? With breathy anxiety, designed to tug at our atavistic fight or flight instincts, they repurpose as news exaggeration, hyperbole, vague allegations, unconfirmed reports and sheer speculation.  The scary part is, of course, that buried and obscured in all that noise might be real news, things that investors and market participants really ought to be paying attention to because they will matter. The trick is sussing out the stuff that matters from the stuff that doesn’t.  So, we really do need to take into account these aspirational swans. One of them could be that figurative dead archduke.  Let’s take a stroll along the red carpet and chat up some of these swans.  Let’s start with our old friend, geopolitical disruption. Certainly, the ongoing horror show in Afghanistan is a thing. This adventure in grotesquery (there was virtually no risk, was there, that any of those helicopter pilots who evacuated the embassy back in August was ever going to land on the embassy roof, right?), it could have been something that moved markets and changed the calculus. But a black swan? Nope, not yet.  Well, then perhaps this sterling expression of American power and resolve might encourage adventurism around the world by the customary bad actors and such adventurism, or even credible threat of such adventurism, could roil markets. No one could have read about that “semi-official” Chinese news outlet publicly musing that the United States’ failure in Afghanistan should tell Taiwan that the jig is up without a frisson of anxiety. But a black swan? Nope, or at least not yet.  Then, of course, there’s the ongoing Covid mess which just refuses to follow the script of a good made-for-television movie. Started well. First, there would be a problem (check). Then our doughty heroes and heroines would engage in hard work and innovation to fix it (mostly check). Then the problem would be resolved. Throw in a car chase and a whiff of romance, roll credits, have a bit of a party and get back to work.  It didn’t happen, or at least it hasn’t happened yet. The plague goes on, the bug is still with us and looks like it might be indefinitely. Look, I’m not going to argue that life has not changed or is not still changing. Small business was and is particularly hard hit, but employment is up, GDP is growing and all the macro indicators are continuing to suggest expansion. There’s more of a feeling of momentum and a return to normalcy right now than something that has triggered fundamental change (check out any college football game this weekend). Doesn’t yet feel like a black swan.  For the moment, continuity wins and catastrophe stays in the Green Room.  How about the ultimate end (or not) of the vast amount of governmental largesse that has been rained on businesses and consumers (err…voters) for this past several years? It’s going to end at some point. Is its expiration a potential black swan?  The combined efforts of the current administration and the last, together with the Fed, moving mountains to avoid any possible threat of an economic downtown caused by a loss of liquidity, has been extraordinary. This has been an entirely unique fiscal and monetary adventure. We are literally off the charts. Here be dragons. The counterfactual is always the handmaiden of rank speculation, but assuming for a moment that all of that intervention, all that fiscal and monetary support had not happened, would we be in the economic wilderness today? We don’t know, but the economy is close to full employment, with moderate (transitory?) inflation and GDP almost fully recovered from the pandemic year. If, arguendo, all that financial support made a difference, what happens when it goes away? Are we back in the wilderness? Will the butcher’s bill come due?  While the occupants of the heights seem, at least publicly, confident that all this largess can be brought in for a soft landing, our track record of engineered soft landings is not, shall we say, sterling. If this Rube Goldberg-like complex of monetary and fiscal stimulus is not perfectly unwound, it’s hard to see how it won’t risk a significant economic disruption.  But it hasn’t happened yet. GFC 2.0 must still wait in the wings.  How about if it doesn’t all end any time soon? Want to talk about real inflation? Stagflation? All this fabulous stimulus and talk of a soft landing from the Covid mess certainly carries with it a significant risk of inflation. While many self-proclaimed experts continue to insist that inflation is transitory (because to admit otherwise is to admit our monetary posture might not be sustainable), there’s certainly evidence out there that it’s not. I get all the arguments about supply disruption, labor issues, material shortages, etc., but I’ll join the Milton Friedman team here and say that we can’t (or shouldn’t) ignore a vast increase in the money supply and a vast increase in liquidity occurring in a market without a concomitant increase in productivity and rapidly growing GDP and be comfortable that inflation is not lurking. Inflation or, God help us, stagflation, will impair value creation, drive up borrowing costs, dry up liquidity, destroy savings and strip any mojo from the economy and ultimately such continued excess itself will lead to a recession when someone finally goes all adult and does something about it (hard to see who that could be at this point).

US Securities & Exchange Commission,Robinhood CEO Unwittingly Inspired $1 Million Meme Stock Fraud,Yahoo! Finance | Medical Laboratories & Research Industry News,Yahoo! Finance,"Robinhood CEO Unwittingly Inspired $1 Million Meme Stock Fraud  (Bloomberg) -- It was easy-money arbitrage fueled by this year’s meme stock mania. Some brokerages were essentially offering free cash, while others weren’t clawing any of the funds back for the second leg of the wager.  Most Read from Bloomberg  How Los Angeles Became the City of Dingbats  Why the Gaza Strip May Be the City of the Future  School Reopenings Falter as U.S. Kids Near 1 Million Covid Cases  The Rise of the Pandemic Dashboard  A Jewish Tradition Makes Room for Unconventional Design  And the traders who did it got the clever idea from Robinhood Markets Inc. Chief Executive Officer Vlad Tenev, who unwittingly inspired them with a remark he made at a high-profile congressional hearing in February.  The trouble -- and the reason the Securities and Exchange Commission dropped the hammer Monday -- was the scheme involved illegal wash trading, or trading with yourself.  The SEC accused Suyun Gu and Yong Lee of improperly pocketing more than $1 million of rebates from stock exchanges from February through April, after placing thousands of options trades for hot shares like GameStop Corp., AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., BlackBerry Ltd. and Nokia Oyj.  Read more: Robinhood, Meme Stocks and Investing as a Game  The U.S. equity market, including the related options business, is built atop a system known as maker-taker. Traders who submit orders that sit on an exchange’s public order book are, in many cases, paid a “maker” rebate -- an incentive designed to attract more liquidity. Those who trade against those resting orders are charged a “taker” fee.  Maker, Taker  Gu, who lives in Miami, and Lee, a resident of Torrance, California, placed the first part of their trades through a broker based in Greenwich, Connecticut and another in Morristown, New Jersey, that pass along the maker rebates to their clients, according to the SEC’s complaint. They targeted out-of-the-money puts for their resting orders, investments that others were unlikely to trade against because the holdings offered little opportunity to make money -- barring something nefarious.  Gu, 35, and Lee, 37, then traded against their own orders through accounts they opened at brokers including Robinhood, which doesn’t pass along “taker” fees to customers. In summary, their profits came from collecting maker rebates without having to pay taker fees. Gu executed approximately 11,430 wash trades, pocketing $668,671, according to the SEC. For Lee, it was 2,360 wash trades and $51,334 of profits, the regulator said.  Lawyers for Gu and Lee didn’t respond to requests for comment.  The SEC didn’t name Tenev or Robinhood. Instead, the agency refers to a “Broker-dealer B” based in Menlo Park, California. The SEC complaint adds that the firm’s CEO appeared before the House Financial Services Committee on Feb. 18, where he said the firm “pioneered commission free and zero contract fee options trading.”  For Tenev, that day was a grueling five-hour ordeal. He faced dozens of probing questions from lawmakers, who accused Robinhood of turning the stock market into a casino while failing to protect retail investors amid the frenzied run-up of GameStop and other stocks.  Read more: Robinhood CEO’s Five-Hour Ordeal Is Capped by Ocasio-Cortez Duel  But Gu heard opportunity, according to the SEC. The former trade-system developer who had worked at several financial firms concluded from Tenev’s testimony that Robinhood didn’t charge its customers “take fees,” the agency said.  Gu’s Admission  Gu’s friend, Lee, joined in the scheme, according to the SEC. While Gu is contesting the regulator’s claims, Lee agreed to pay a $25,000 fine and about $52,000 in disgorgement and interest without admitting or denying wrongdoing. The SEC added that its investigation didn’t initially prompt Gu to stop breaking the law.  “During investigative testimony, Gu said that, although he is not currently using his trading strategy, he may do so in the future,” the SEC said in its complaint. “Gu also admitted that he continued to engage in wash trading after receiving the SEC’s investigative subpoena.”  Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek  A Tiny Piece of Plastic Is Helping Farmers Use Far Less Water  The Energy Future Needs Cleaner Batteries  Evergrande Debt Crisis Is Financial Stress Test No One Wanted  Microsoft and an Army of Tiny Telecoms Are Part of a Plan to Wire Rural America  In Amazon’s Flagship Fulfillment Center, the Machines Run the Show  ©2021 Bloomberg L.P."

Specifically, the subject exclusion precluded coverage for ""'personal and advertising injury’ arising directly or indirectly out of any action or omission that violates or is alleged to violate:  (1) The Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA), including any amendment of or addition to such law; (2) The CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, including any amendment of or addition to such law; (3) The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), and any amendment of or addition to such law, including the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (FACTA); or (4) Any federal, state or local statute, ordinance or regulation, other than the TCPA, CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 or FCRA and their amendments and additions, that addresses, prohibits, or limits the printing, dissemination, disposal, collecting, recording, sending, transmitting, communicating or distribution of material or information.”  In deciding that this exclusion clearly applied to BIPA, the court utilized the rule of ejusdem generis, i.e., that the exclusion applied to statutes ""of the same kind, character and nature"" as those specifically referenced in the exclusion. The court found that BIPA was similar to the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA), Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography And Marketing (CAN-SPAM) Act, and Fair Credit Reporting Act/Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (FCRA/FACTA) in that they all protected privacy interests. Notably, the court distinguished the 2021 Illinois Supreme Court decision in West Bend Mut. Ins. Co. v. Krishna Schaumburg Tan, Inc., which held that a different version of the exclusion did not apply to BIPA.  Mr. Goldwater has been an advocate for insurance carriers in declaratory judgment and bad faith litigation for more than 25 years. In addition to an extraordinary record of success, the hallmark of Mr. Goldwater’s practice has been its breadth, touching on every cutting-edge area of insurance law. He has been in the vanguard of consulting on and litigating coverage issues involving cyber liability, D&O, professional liability, public entities, EPL, advertising injury, construction defects, toxic tort, environmental, commercial property, and auto.  Ms. Ognibene is a member of Lewis Brisbois' Insurance Law and Insurance Coverage Practices. She has nationwide experience counseling clients on both coverage and extra-contractual matters involving most types of policies, including professional liability, directors' and officers' liability, employment practices liability, general liability, and more. She also has experience with novel coverage issues involving claims brought under BIPA and has authored “hot topic” papers on the subject.  Lewis Brisbois was the first law firm in the country to establish an Illinois BIPA practice dedicated solely to assisting clients facing claims under the Act, following the Illinois Supreme Court's landmark decision in Rosenbach v. Six Flags Entertainment Corporation, which drastically reduced the threshold required for an individual to seek redress for alleged violations of BIPA.

European Securities Markets Authority,Call for expressions of interest: Group of Economic Advisers for ESMA’s Committee for Economic and Markets Analysis,ESMA | Latest Updates,European Securities and Markets Authority,"Call for expressions of interest: Group of Economic Advisers for ESMA’s Committee for Economic and Markets Analysis  Tuesday 28 September 2021 10:07 Related documents:: esma50-167-2758_application_form_-_gea.docx  ESMA • CS 60747 – 103 rue de Grenelle • 75345 Paris Cedex 07 • France • Tel. +33 (0) 1 58 36 43 21 • www.esma.europa.eu   Call  for  expressions  of  interest:  Group  of  Economic  Advisers  for  ESMA’s   Committee for Economic and Markets Analysis   Background   1.  The three-year term of the current Group of Economic Advisers (‘GEA’) for ESMA’s   Committee  for  Economic  and  Markets  Analysis  (’CEMA’)  is  due  to  expire.   Therefore, ESMA is today launching the process to renew the GEA of CEMA.    2.  ESMA has established the GEA to benefit from the expertise of stakeholders who   are specialised in the analysis and risk assessment related to the markets under   ESMA’s  remit  (securities  markets,  market  infrastructures,  institutional  and  retail   investors) and with a view to ESMA’s institutional objectives, in particular to promote   investor protection, orderly markets and financial stability. CEMA looks to this group   to provide expert advice regarding ESMA market analytical activities.    3.  The GEA is a Consultative Working Group under the ESMA “Procedures for ESMA   groups” of March 2012. Members of such groups are to be selected following an   open call for candidates published on the ESMA website and are appointed for a   period of three years. The relevant extracts of the procedures are set out in the   Appendix. When the selection is completed, ESMA will inform the applicants of the   outcome and publish the composition of the 2021-2024 GEA on its website.    Committee for Economic and Markets Analysis (CEMA)   4.  ESMA  carries  out  economic  analysis  covering  the  markets  in  the  area  of  its   competence  including  the  monitoring,  assessing  and  measuring  of  market   developments, systemic risk and other impediments to financial stability, and the   provision  of  information  about  micro-prudential  trends,  potential  risks  and   vulnerabilities to the relevant EU institutions. The Board of Supervisors (BoS) of   ESMA established to this purpose CEMA and specified its mandate in its terms of   reference for CEMA.   5.  CEMA  contributes  to  ESMA’s  mission  by  monitoring  developments  in  financial   markets, assessing systemic risks and providing economic background analysis for   the general tasks of ESMA. In particular by:   -    Assessing Risks to Investors, Markets and Financial Stability:    o    CEMA contributes to the identification, the monitoring, and the assessment of   trends,  potential  risks  and  vulnerabilities  in  financial  markets  from  a  micro-  prudential and investor protection perspective;    Date: 28 September 2021   ESMA50-167-2758   2   o    CEMA contributes to the regular reporting on risks and vulnerabilities to the   relevant EU institutions pursuant to Art. 32 of the ESMA Regulation;    o    CEMA contributes to the exploration and exploitation of ESMA proprietary data,   by supporting ESMA work on enhancing the completeness and the quality of   these data, and by contributing to the development and generation of market   indicators and risk metrics for the analytical and monitoring tasks of ESMA.   -    Promoting Supervisory Convergence:    o    CEMA  contributes  to  ESMA’s  objective  of  supervisory  convergence  by   participating in the development of a harmonized framework for the assessment   of systemic risks and financial stability issues in cooperation with the ESRB and   other  ESAs  and  by  providing  economic  and  risk  analysis  on  supervisory   convergence issues.   -    Completing a Single Rulebook for EU financial markets:    o    CEMA  may  contribute  to  better  regulation  by  actively  supporting  ESMA’s   commitment to Impact Assessments of existing, planned or proposed regulation   and  supervisory  practice,  through  analysing  the  impact  of  effects,  including   unintended side-effects.   Description of main GEA tasks   6.  In  accordance  with  ESMA’s  ‘Procedures  for  ESMA  groups’,  ESMA  expects   members  of  the  GEA  group  to  provide  technical  assistance  in  the  field  of  their   expertise  to  ESMA’s  efforts  in  the  area  of  risk  monitoring,  market  analysis,   developing methodologies for impact assessment and stress testing, and providing   background information for the design of regulatory and supervisory policies.   7.  ESMA  will  look  to  the  GEA  to  contribute  actively  to  our  discussions  about  the   identification and construction of appropriate measures for general and systemic   risks in our semi-annual meetings as well as to provide advice in the areas of their   expertise  in the  periods  in  between  the  semi-annual  meetings.  In  particular,  we   invite GEA members to provide input to our semi-annual meetings by presenting   relevant topics in the field of their expertise.   8.  ESMA  relies  upon GEA  members to  provide  mentoring  and  support  to CEMA’s   various research task forces and analytic work streams. These services typically   include the provision of advice to the planning and the implementation of research   projects, methodological input, the constructive discussion of intermediary or final   outcomes  as  well  as  the  reviewing  of  draft  research reports.  This  may  for GEA   members with an academic background and working for academic institutions or   public authorities also include joint risk analysis projects with ESMA staff and CEMA   members.   3   9.  ESMA expects GEA members to be available for the refereeing of articles submitted   to the ESMA Working Paper Series. This task includes the provision of refereeing   reports and the engagement in an active discussion of the contents of submitted   Working Papers with their authors.   10.  ESMA  looks  to  the  GEA  to  support  the  extension  of  our  research  network  by   providing  contacts  to  other  experts  and  provide  recommendations  on  which   institutions or experts to contact with regard to specific issues and topics. To this   purpose, we invite GEA members to raise any relevant data, events or institutions   to ESMA’s attention.   Terms of Appointment   11.  GEA members are selected for a renewable term of three years.    12.  GEA members are appointed on a personal basis and are bound by confidentiality   requirements in relation to all non-public information they are provided with while   performing their tasks.    Selection criteria     13.  This  call  for  expressions  of  interest  is  open  to  relevant  stakeholders  from  the   European Union (EU).    14.  The  GEA,  which  will  not  exceed  18  members  in  total,  will  be  composed  of   individuals representing as balanced a proportion as possible of the relevant areas   of expertise in the field of financial stability, research on financial markets or the   financial sector, risk surveillance on an aggregate level as well as general economic   research or analysis related to financial markets (areas covered by CEMA).    15.  The  selection  of  GEA  members  will  aim  to  ensure,  to  the  extent  possible,  an   appropriate geographical and gender balance, and representation of all relevant   stakeholders across the EU affected by the work of CEMA. In particular, ESMA will   be  seeking  to  ensure  a  balanced  representation  of  the  following  types  of   stakeholders:    a.  financial  market  participants  /  financial  services’  intermediaries  /  financial   consumer representatives;     b.  academics.    16.  Assessment of eligibility will be based on the following criteria:   a.  a minimum of 10 years of relevant experience in the financial services sector   related  to  economic  analysis,  risk  monitoring  and  financial  stability  will  be   required for those representing financial institutions;    4   b.  a minimum of 10 years of experience relevant to research related to financial   services field will be required for academics.    Selection process    17.  Applications will be accepted from natural persons only. Only the natural person   selected will be admitted to the GEA. No substitution (alternates) of natural persons   will be permitted throughout the full duration of the appointment, or during possible   renewals.    18.  Applicants not selected may be included on a list of experts, with the possibility of   being invited to become a GEA member at a later stage.    19.  ESMA’s  Executive  Director,  in  consultation  with  the  Head  of  Risk  Analysis  and   Economics and the Chair of CEMA, will make the final selection of GEA members.    20.  ESMA reserves the right to exclude at any time from the CWG those members who   breach  the  terms  of  reference  contained  in  the  annex  in  a  serious  manner,   particularly  when  it  comes  to  a  minimum  level  of  attendance,  breaches  of   confidentiality or misrepresentation of their status of CWG members (points 3.B.iv,   3.B.v and 6 of the Annex 1).   Place of provision of services   21.  The GEA will meet at least two times a year. The meetings are organised by ESMA   and  take  place  in  virtual  form  (video-conference)  unless  it  is  agreed  differently   between  GEA  members  and  the  Committee  rapporteur.  Periodic  interactions   between  meetings  through  conference  calls  with  members  of the  GEA are  also   anticipated.    22.  GEA members are expected to attend all meetings; the first meeting of the new   GEA will take place on 23 November 2021.    Compensation, travel expenses    23.

EXTERNAL CONSULTATIVE WORKING GROUPS   10.  ESMA  groups  reporting  to  the  Board  of  Supervisors  may  establish  Consultative   Working Groups (CWGs) in order to benefit from the expertise of market participants who are   specialised in the specific area for which the group is responsible. The purpose of CWGs is to   provide advice to the ESMA group during the course of developing a policy line in relation to   specific technical matters, or to give a view on specific aspects of the proposals. The role and   responsibilities  of  CWGs  are  without  prejudice  to  those  of  the  Securities  and  Markets   Stakeholder Group.   11.  CWG members are selected following an open call for candidates  published on the   ESMA website, including advice from members of the Board of Supervisors and the Standing   Committee, with a final selection being made by the Executive Director in consultation with the   relevant Head of Division/Unit of ESMA and the Chair of the relevant group. CWG members   are appointed on a personal basis. Members of the CWG may be removed upon decision of   the Executive Director in consultation with the Chair of the relevant group.   12.  Terms of reference of CWGs are given in Annex 1.     7   Annex 1   These Terms of Reference are without prejudice to the role and responsibilities of the   Securities and Markets Stakeholders Group   Terms of Reference of Consultative Working Groups   1.  The  purpose  of  the  Consultative  Working  Group  (CWG)  is  to  provide  technical   assistance  to  ESMA  in  relation  to  all  aspects  of  a  particular  group’s  work,  such  as  the   preparation of draft regulatory and implementing technical standards, Article 16 guidelines and   the delivery of advice to the European Commission on the delegated and implementing acts   required under a Directive/Regulation. The group is formed under the terms of ESMA’s Public   Statement  on  Consultation  Practices  (ESMA/2011/11).  The  CWG  should  be  composed  of   market participants, consumers and end-users. Members of the CWG are selected according   to the procedure set out in Section II of the Procedures for ESMA groups. The composition of   the CWG is made public.     2.  In meeting the above purpose, the group may be called upon to provide input at all   stages of the policy formulation process.   3.  In meeting the above objectives, the ESMA group and the CWG will apply the following   principles.   A.  Members of the CWG will have:   i.  Access to evolving thinking of the ESMA group, including of any specific issues   causing difficulty.    ii.  The  possibility to  express  their  views  to  the  ESMA  group. Members  of the   ESMA group will be encouraged to attend meetings of the CWG.   iii.  A work plan, including the dates of the main meetings of the CWG for the year   ahead. Additional meetings can be called either at the request of members of   the Consultative Working Group or of ESMA. Meetings are called by the Chair   of the ESMA group in consultation with the rapporteur.    iv.  The  support  of  ESMA  staff  and  the  contact  details  of  all  members  of  the   relevant ESMA group.   B.  ESMA can expect the following from the members of the CWG:   Members will provide their independent expertise and not lobby for specific national or   institutional  positions.  Members  of  the  CWG  are  appointed  and  participate  in  their   personal capacity.    i.  Practical examples to illustrate the implications of policy proposals.   8   ii.  A sounding board that is prepared to provide alternative solutions and not just   identification of problems.   iii.  That all information provided by ESMA will be handled with due confidentiality   and not circulated to third parties.     iv.  That members will endeavour to make themselves available both to attend   meetings and provide timely written submissions where required.   v.  The identification of specific issues that might require a subset of the CWG to   consider. ESMA may call on additional experts where appropriate.   4.  The final output of the work-stream is under ESMA’s authority and is without prejudice   to the opinion of the CWG.   5.  Members of the Consultative Working Group are selected for a renewable term of two   years.   6.  Members of the CWG should make clear in their professional engagements that they   are not representatives of ESMA.     "
Hart-Scott-Rodino Act,Change in Approach by FTC Creates New Challenges for M&A Deals,Lexology | Corporate & M&A,Lexology,"Change in Approach by FTC Creates New Challenges for M&A Deals  In a memorandum issued to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) staff last week, Lina Khan, the new Chair of the FTC, indicated that the agency's  In a memorandum issued to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) staff last week, Lina Khan, the new Chair of the FTC, indicated that the agency's priorities and approaches in reviewing proposed M&A deals will differ from those in the past. Kahn stated that the FTC, rather than viewing its work in two ""silos"" relating to antitrust and consumer protection, will be reviewing deals ""holistically"" and taking an ""integrated approach"" to the harms that ""Americans are facing in their daily lives."" She explained, for example, that the agency will focus on whether there are ""power asymmetries"" leading to ""harms across markets, including those directed at marginalized communities,"" and whether the business models and structures used will ""incentivize or enable"" unlawful conduct. Further, she stated that, given ""the growing role of private equity and other investment vehicles,"" the agency will ""examine how these business models may distort ordinary incentives in ways that strip productive capacity and may facilitate unfair methods of competition and consumer protection violations,"" particularly when ""these abuses target marginalized communities ....""1  It remains to be seen to what extent the FTC will be adopting the fundamental changes suggested in the Khan memorandum, and thus will be reviewing M&A transactions based not only on a conventional horizontal and vertical market-based antitrust analysis but also on the broader societal impacts. Over the past few months, we understand that in some deals the FTC has been seeking information during the second request stage of its investigations about topics such as unions, wages, the environment, corporate governance, franchising, diversity, and noncompete agreements. Unlike the Department of Justice, Antitrust Division (DOJ), which resides within the Executive Branch, the FTC is an independent agency, with two Republican Commissioners who have already expressed concerns regarding the changes under Khan's leadership. Nevertheless, the Khan memorandum is but one in a series of recent developments that suggest that there already has been a rapid, significant shift to increased enforcement of the antitrust laws and, in that effort, the use of broader, novel theories of harm to competition and/or consumer protection. Accordingly, M&A deals now face prolonged timelines and more risk on the regulatory front--including, it appears, even for those deals that do not present significant competitive overlap or risk of harm from vertical integration, but may raise issues relating to other social impacts.  In addition to the Khan memorandum, other notable antitrust-related developments this year have included the following:  Suspension of HSR early termination. Within weeks after President Biden's inauguration in January, the FTC announced a ""temporary"" suspension--which remains in effect--of early termination of the 30-day waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act (HSR Act) for transactions presenting no competitive concerns.2 The FTC has cited an unprecedented number of filings as the reason for its suspending early termination.  ""Whole-of-government"" antitrust effort. In July, President Biden issued an Executive Order that established 72 initiatives by more than a dozen federal agencies for more ""vigorous"" enforcement of the antitrust laws as part of a ""whole-of-government"" effort to ""take decisive action to reduce the trend of corporate consolidation."" The Order promised executive branch support for ""aggressive legislative reforms""; established a White House Competition Council; and confirmed that certain mergers will be subject to longer review periods, greater scrutiny, and the government's advancement of novel theories of harm. Notably, the Order expressly reaffirmed that the antitrust agencies have the authority to challenge even transactions that have already closed. 3  ""Pre-Consummation Warning Letters."" In early August, the new head of the FTC's Bureau of Competition issued a memorandum stating that, in light of what was described as a ""tidal wave"" volume of merger filings under the HSR Act this year, the FTC has adopted a new practice of issuing ""Pre-Consummation Warning Letters."" These form letters are being issued to the parties in deals as to which the FTC has not been able to conduct or complete its investigation within the deadlines imposed by statute.4 The letter alerts the deal parties that the FTC's investigation remains open, and reminds them that, as the agency may subsequently determine that the deal was unlawful, if they ""choose to proceed with [their] transaction that ha[s] not been fully investigated [they] are doing so at their own risk.""5  New prioritization of ""populist"" issues. This month, the FTC announced that it has approved compulsory process rules (which allow the agency to collect extensive documents and witness testimony) in connection with its reviews in certain areas it is prioritizing. While Big Tech, oil and gas, healthcare, and ""dominant"" companies continue to be prioritized, there has been a notable shift in tone to emphasize more populist-type pocketbook issues (e.g., practices affecting labor markets or small business operations).6 For M&A deals, the new rules permit a single Commissioner to issue compulsory process in the form of a Second Request for HSR-reportable transactions and a Civil Investigative Demand for consummated transactions; whereas, previously, a majority vote was needed.  Withdrawal of Vertical Merger Guidelines. At a mid-September public meeting, the FTC Commissioners voted 3-2 along party lines to withdraw the joint FTC/DOJ Vertical Merger Guidelines that were issued just last year. In voting for the withdrawal, the majority harshly criticized the guidelines as being based on ""unsound economic theories that are unsupported by the law or market realities.""7 The FTC has stated that the agency will be working with the DOJ to update merger guidance to better reflect market realities. The same day, the DOJ issued a statement that it is conducting a careful review of the guidelines (both vertical and horizontal), but indicated that the Vertical Merger Guidelines remain in place at the DOJ.8  Continued focus on acquisitions of startups. At the same mid-September public meeting, the FTC Commissioners released the results of a study undertaken by the prior Administration of non-reportable M&A transactions involving large technology companies acquiring start-up companies. An outgoing FTC Commissioner proposed that Congress should reduce the HSR filing thresholds9 so that the agency will be apprised of and can review the potential anticompetitive effects of these types of acquisitions before they are consummated. He also stated that avoidance techniques that purportedly have been used to evade the thresholds (such as disguising the ""real"" purchase price through grants of deferred or contingent compensation to founders and employees) should be prohibited. Another FTC Commissioner commented that, while there may not appear to be antitrust concerns when such acquisitions are viewed individually, the agency should consider the anticompetitive effects of a steady stream of such acquisitions.10 It is possible that the Administration's concerns will spill over to concentrated industries beyond Big Tech.  Aggressive state antitrust enforcement. The incoming head of the national task force that coordinates competition enforcement by the states has emphasized that state attorneys general will continue to bring antitrust cases under state laws even if Congress does not pass legislation specifically granting states equal footing with the federal government in enforcing antitrust laws.11  We would note that, notwithstanding these developments, it is still uncertain to what extent the government actually will pursue and press this apparently social policy-oriented approach in connection with its antitrust reviews of mergers. There is also uncertainty as to which specific issues the agencies will devote their attention beyond the traditional antitrust merits, although labor-related issues appear at least initially to be an area of focus. Finally, it remains to be seen whether the new approach, if challenged, would be judicially upheld.  Practice Points  Merger parties should expect a longer antitrust review period and a changed focus in the investigation, especially if before the FTC. Participants in M&A deals, including in private equity deals, should be prepared for questions by the antitrust agencies on topics not previously considered of major relevance--such as the impact of the proposed transaction on labor, privacy, the environment, climate change, diversity, marginalized communities, production capacity, and others. The agencies may determine to focus generally on certain topics, or may raise different issues in individual deals.  Merger parties should consider, at the earliest stages of a transaction:  whether, in addition to the traditional antitrust issues, there are other issues that create potential vulnerabilities for the deal based on the agencies' new approach;  whether proactively to address these issues (such as by making certain social policy-related changes or commitments), and, if not, how any agency concerns about such issues might later be ""remediated"" if that becomes required; and  whether the likelihood of a longer regulatory process and/or the increased risk of an adverse result in the regulatory process affects the parties' deal terms.  Early engagement of antitrust counsel will be critical for vigilant management of the HSR process--even for deals that present a low level of competitive overlap or vertical concerns. Antitrust counsel can help to make the threshold determination whether the transaction is likely to pass muster with the antitrust agencies, and on what timetable and terms; to identify and frame the competitive issues, and now the other issues, the agencies may consider; and to review management, board and banker materials and presentations so that the deal can be presented to the antitrust regulators in the best possible light, without problematic documentation that could delay or reduce the likelihood of, or increase the conditions for, successful completion of the antitrust review process.  In our view, it is unlikely that the antitrust agencies will significantly increase their use of postclosing challenges. While the Pre-Consummation Warning Letters serve as a reminder of the potential for post-closing challenges, it is not necessarily likely that more post-closing challenges actually will be brought. First, it seems to us unlikely that the agency would, in any widespread way, entangle itself in the complexities and burdens of investigating and ""unscrambling"" already-closed transactions. Also, it seems to us unlikely in general that the agency would choose to forego the leverage it has, pre-closing, to encourage parties to provide information and take remedial actions so that their closing can occur without the risks of a still-open investigation.  In light of longer, more expansive antitrust reviews, as well as a greater risk of (i) closing in the face of a still-open antitrust investigation, (ii) broader remedial packages, (iii) litigation being brought by the antitrust agencies, and (iv) post-closing challenge by the antitrust agencies, drafters of merger agreements should consider whether to:  require parties to close if an antitrust agency investigation is still open after expiration of the HSR period;  provide for a longer period for the ""End Date"" than would have been typical previously;  provide for a ""reverse termination fee"" to be paid by the buyer to the target (or the seller) if the antitrust investigations were not completed and the deal was terminated (and, if so, whether at a different amount than would have been typical previously); and  alter the approach to the antitrust efforts and divestiture covenants (or other provisions, such as the covenant to operate in the ordinary course of business pending closing)."

Continue Reading…  Last week, the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) brought its first enforcement action against a debt collector and debt buyer for violating the state’s Consumer Financial Protection Law (CCFPL). The DFPI’s Desist and Refrain Order and Order Assessing Penalties (totaling $375,000) charges F & F Management Inc. (F&F) with violating the CCFPL by (1) engaging in unfair acts and practices, and (2) and violating the CA Rosenthal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (Rosenthal), the CA Consumer Credit Reporting Agencies Act (CCRAA), and the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA). The CCFPL makes it unlawful for a covered person to engage in any unlawful, unfair, deceptive, or abusive act or practice with respect to consumer financial services or products or to offer or provide a consumer financial product or service not it conformity with any consumer financial law.  The DFPI charges F&F with violating Rosenthal by leaving automated messages for consumers in which it made false representations and threats to take action prohibited by the Rosenthal Act, including that it had commenced legal proceedings when it had not done so and would contact the consumer’s employer.  It also charges F&F with engaging in unfair acts and practices in violation of the CCFPL and with violating the CCRAA by engaging in “debt parking.” This practice, also referred to as “passive debt collection,” involves the placing of purported debts on consumers’ credit reports without first attempting to communicate with consumers about the debts. (In December 2020, the FTC announced a settlement of its first enforcement action targeting “debt parking.” In addition, the CFPB’s final debt collection rules, which become effective November 30, 2021, prohibit reporting debts to consumer reporting agencies until after a debt collector attempt to make contact with the consumer.)  F&F is also charged with violating Rosenthal and the FDCPA by failing to provide validation notices and falsely representing that additional amounts would be added to consumers’ debts if they were not paid. (F&F’s FDCPA violations are charged both directly and indirectly as Rosenthal violations. Rosenthal requires “debt collectors,” a term that includes first-party collections, to comply with the FDCPA.)"

I have told this story before:    When I became Chief Justice, I met for  the first time with all of the Assignment  Judges in the conference center at the  Justice Complex.  As I looked across the room, I could not help but  notice that I was the only woman there.  I wondered then, how the  “men” would react to the new “woman” Chief Justice.  What I   learned was that gender was not an issue, did not matter.  As we  worked together, as we planned and implemented court integration,  as we discussed our priorities for the years ahead, I understood   that those men—and later, there were women—would be both   colleagues and friends, and that I would treasure our relationships  and our time together.    Today we have greater diversity at every level of management  throughout the Judiciary and that is good.  Diversity  expands the perspectives and experiences we rely on  to find creative solutions to the problems that confront  us and to arrive at well-reasoned, thoughtful decisions.  Indeed, we have become stronger and wiser because  we are more diverse and because we reflect the   perspectives and experiences of the public we serve.  I am proud of all that we have accomplished in the past  ten years.  Judges, managers and staff, together, we  have worked toward a common goal — providing a fair  and efficient justice system for the people of New  Jersey.  I thank all of you, my judicial colleagues, the  staff in the vicinages and in the Administrative Office,  for your hard work and dedication.  Your commitment  does make a difference.  A Letter from   Chief Justice Deborah T. Poritz  I  2  This is the final annual report we have prepared  under the leadership of our Chief Justice, Deborah  T. Poritz.  In addition to providing an overview of our  accomplishments during the past court year, this  report highlights some of the longer-term goals that  we have attained during her term in office.    I have had the pleasure of working with Chief Justice Poritz not only as the acting  administrative director of the courts, but as a judge of the Appellate Division and,  before that, as the assignment judge in Mercer Vicinage.  Since her first day in  office, I have admired her wisdom, her intellect, and her equanimity.  She joined  the Judiciary just as statewide unification had begun in earnest, and she  approached every challenge and every hurdle with a steady hand and a clear vision  of the true goal of unification:  fairness.  Fairness so that no matter where in the  state a court was located, its judges and staff had adequate funding to ensure a   just resolution to every dispute.  Fairness so that no matter in which vicinage   court personnel worked, they each received equitable compensation for their   contribution.  Fairness so that no matter where a case was filed, the case would be  resolved according to a standard set of practices and procedures.    As a jurist, Chief Justice Poritz has earned respect from the legal community for  her thoughtful and well-reasoned opinions.  Her commitment to upholding the  law, regardless of the issue or political implications of the decision, has brought  justice to thousands of litigants and maintained the tradition of judicial excellence  for which New Jersey is well known.     In addition to thanking the Chief Justice for the pleasure of working  with her, I want to, once again, thank our hard-working judges,  Judiciary employees and staff for their commitment and dedication  during the past year.  One of the highlights of my past two years as  acting administrative director has been my meeting and working  directly with so many of the people who move the Judiciary forward  toward new goals of excellence and service.  As I complete the   second year of my work as acting administrative director, I become  more and more aware of just how fortunate I have been to work  with a wide variety of talented, enthusiastic and capable people.    I invite you to read this report and to share in our sense   of accomplishment.  A Letter from   Acting Administrative  Director Philip S. Carchman, J.A.D.  3  Retirement of Chief Justice Poritz  4  hief  hief Justice Deborah T.  Poritz was sworn into office  on July 10, 1996.  She is the  first woman to serve as  Chief Justice in New Jersey.  Born in New York on  October 26, 1936, she graduated  magna cum laude from Brooklyn  College.  She was a Woodrow  Wilson Fellow in English and  American Literature at Columbia  University before attending   graduate school at Brandeis  University.  From 1967 to 1970, she  taught English composition and  British literature courses at Ursinus  College in Collegeville, Pa.    Chief Justice Poritz received her  law degree from the University of  Pennsylvania Law School in 1977.  She began her legal career in the  New Jersey Department of Law  and Public Safety, where she held  numerous positions including  deputy attorney general and assis-  tant chief in the Environmental  Protection Section.  In 1982 she  was named deputy attorney   general in charge of appeals.  From 1984 to 1986, she also  served as chief of the Banking,  Insurance and Public Securities  Section.  In 1986 she was named  assistant attorney general and  director of the Division of Law.  She served in those positions  until 1989, when she became  chief counsel to Governor  Thomas H. Kean.    Chief Justice Poritz left public  service in 1990 and worked in pri-  vate practice until 1994, when she  was named attorney general by  Governor Christine Todd  Whitman.  She was appointed  Chief Justice by Governor  Whitman in 1996 and reappointed  by Governor James E. McGreevey  in 2004 .    C  Retirement of  Chief Justice Deborah T. Poritz   P  h  o  t  o  b  y  C  a  r  m  e  n  N  a  t  a  l  e    The New Jersey Supreme Court  has a long-established reputation  for progressive thinking and indi-  viduals’ rights, a tradition upheld  by the “Poritz Court.”  Here is a brief review of  some of the most notable  decisions authored by  Chief Justice Poritz on  behalf of the Court:    State in the Interest  of J.G., N.S. and J.T.  151 N.J. 565 (1997)  The Supreme Court ruled that a  convicted sex offender may be  required to submit to HIV testing  at the victim’s request.  Although  the defendant argued that the  testing would violate the Fourth  Amendment prohibition against  unreasonable searches and the  Fourteenth Amendment right to  due process, the Court ruled that,  given probable cause that the  offender may have exposed the  victim to HIV, the compelling  interest in protecting the health  of the victim outweighs the   defendant’s right to privacy.  N.J. Transit PBA Local 304  v. N.J. Transit Corp.   151 N.J. 531 (1997)  Defendant, New Jersey Transit  Corporation, adopted a drug and  alcohol testing policy that includ-  ed random testing of employees  responsible for safety-sensitive  functions in order to comply with  regulations promulgated by the  Federal Transit Administration.  Plaintiff New Jersey Transit PBA  Local 304 challenged the constitu-  tionality of the random testing  policy.  The Court held that   random drug testing of Transit  police officers did not violate the  state or federal constitutions.  As  employees of a highly regulated  industry responsible for safety-  Equally important, uniformity and standardization  have helped the courts to achieve unprecedented reduc-  tions in case backlog in every practice area.   Backlog  refers to cases that remain open beyond the self-imposed  time goals that the Judiciary has established for each  case type.  The reduction in the Judiciary’s backlog  reflects an increase in the number of cases that are  resolved in a timely manner by the courts.    Dale v. Boy Scouts   of America   160 N.J. 562 (1999)  Plaintiff had been a member of  the Boy Scouts of America (BSA)  since the age of eight, and had  attained the position of assistant  scoutmaster.  The BSA revoked  plaintiff ’s membership after a  newspaper article identified him  as the co-president of the Rutgers  Universty Lesbian/Gay Alliance.  Because the BSA is a public  accommodation under the New  Jersey Law Against Discrimination  (LAD), N.J.S.A. 10:5-51, and  because BSA revoked plaintiff ’s  membership based on his avowed  homosexuality, BSA violated the  LAD.  Plaintiff ’s membership did  not violate BSA’s First  Amendment Rights of Association  because plaintiff ’s presence in the  organization did not constitute  BSA’s endorsement of homosexu-  ality.  On review by the U.S.  Supreme Court, this ruling was  overturned.  J  ustice  sensitive functions, transit union’s  members were subject to   suspicionless drug testing when  the policy was carefully drawn to  protect plaintiff ’s members’   privacy rights.  In this context, the  state has a compelling interest in  public safety.    Planned Parenthood   of Central New Jersey   v. Farmer   165 N.J. 609 (2000)  The Court ruled that New Jersey’s  Parental Notification for Abortion  Act (N.J.S.A. 9:17A-a.a to –1.12)  unfairly restricted the fundamen-  tal right of a woman to choose  whether to have an abortion.  Because the state did not offer  adequate justification for   distinguishing between minors  seeking an abortion (when  parental notification was  required) and minors seeking  medical and surgical care relating  to their pregnancies (when  parental notification was not  required), the Court held that the  Act violated equal protection   principles set forth in Article I,  paragraph 1 of the New Jersey  Constitution.  Retirement of Chief Justice Poritz  5  Landmark Opinions  J.B. v. M.B.   170 N.J. 9 (2001)  A divorced couple disagreed over  whether preembryos held in   storage from a previous in vitro   fertilization attempt could be used  by the ex-husband to produce chil-  dren with another woman.  The  court ruled that the husband’s  right to procreate was not lost if he  was denied the opportunity to use  or donate the preembryos, and  that the wife could not be required  to become a biological parent, with  all its attendant consequences,  against her will.  The husband  could choose to keep the preem-  bryos in storage, or they were to be  destroyed.    Toll Brothers Inc. v.  Township of West Windsor  173 N.J. 502 (2002)  New Jersey’s Mount Laurel line   of cases obligates New Jersey  municipalities to provide for low  and moderate income housing in  their land use planning.  The Court  provided a builder’s remedy as an  enforcement mechanism for its  ruling.  The Legislature enacted  the New Jersey Fair Housing Law,  N.J.S.A. 52:27D-301 to –329, which  established a means for allocations  of a municipality’s fair share of low  and moderate income housing and  protection from the builders’   remedy by way of certification  from the Fair Housing Council.  After resolution of its original  Mount Laurel lawsuit, West  Windsor Township let its certifica-  tion lapse without building the  required units of affordable   housing.  The developer sued the  town, again seeking a builder’s  remedy.  The Court granted a  builder’s remedy after finding that  the Township of West Windsor had  violated the New Jersey  Constitution and the Fair Housing  Act by preventing a realistic oppor-  tunity for development of afford-  able housing through its   ordinances, regulations and site  requirements in respect of the  development of property.   New Jersey Democratic  Party v. Samson   175 N.J. 178 (2002)  Thirty-five days before the general  election, Senator Robert Torricelli  withdrew his name as the  Democratic Party’s candidate for  the United States Senate after   having won a place on the ballot in  the primary election.  Plaintiffs  sought to replace the Senator on  the ballot with another candidate  named by the Party.  N.J.S.A. 19:13-  20 provides an absolute right,  when a candidate withdraws up  until 51 days before an election, for  the candidate’s party to replace  him or her, provided it does so 48  days before the election.  The  Democratic Party was permitted to  place another candidate on the  ballot after the deadline in order to  provide the voters with a choice on  Election Day.  The Court deter-  mined that in the limited time  remaining election officials would  be able to prepare and mail absen-  tee ballots.  Sojourner v. New Jersey  Department of Human  Services   177 N.J. 318 (2003)  The plaintiffs in this case asked  the Court to find the Work First  New Jersey Act (WFNJ), N.J.S.A.  44:10-61(a), unconstitutional  because it ""caps"" the amount of  cash assistance given to families  receiving welfare, regardless of  any additional children they may  have.  The Court found that the  government cannot be required  to provide additional support to  families who have chosen to have  additional children after entering  the State welfare system.  State v. Fuller   182 N.J. 174 (2004)  A prosecutor exercised perempto-  ry challenges to excuse two  potential jurors, a minister and a  Muslim (based on the individual’s  dress and name). The prosecutor  claimed that he took exhibitions  of religious devotion as an indica-  tion of lenient tendencies toward  the defense, which, he argued,  was a permissible basis for exclu-  sion.  The Court held that the two  potential jurors were members of  a cognizable group and that the  prosecutor had failed to present  sufficient evidence of situation-  specific bias to justify the peremp-  tory challenges.  Raleigh Avenue Beach  Association v. Atlantic  Beach Club, Inc.  185 N.J. 40 (2005)   Under public trust doctrine, a pri-  vate beach club could not limit  the public’s access to its dry sand  beach area.  Under the doctrine,  the public must be permitted to  enjoy recreational activities on the  beach.  The Court based its ruling  on a prior long-standing public  access to and use of the beach, a  Coastal Area Facility Review Act  (CAFRA), N.J.S.A. 13:19-1 to –21,  permit issued to a condominium  project that required public  access to the beach, the lack of  publicly owned beaches in the  township, and the club’s use of  the beach as a business enter-  prise.   The club was permitted to  charge a reasonable fee to cover  expenses for lifeguards, trash  removal, and "

DOL Conflict of Interest Rule,Brad Campbell Comments on DOL Investment Advice Rule Compliance With InvestmentNews,Faegre Drinker Biddle & Reath | Insights,Faegre Drinker Biddle & Reath,"Bradford P. Campbell  Brad Campbell Comments on DOL Investment Advice Rule Compliance With InvestmentNews  According to an article by InvestmentNews, delaying the implementation of a Department of Labor (DOL) investment advice rule would likely benefit small advisory firms working to comply with the regulation. Benefits and executive compensation partner Brad Campbell describes the potential impact of the rule on registered investment advisors (RIAs).  The publication reported that 10 financial trade associations wrote to the DOL and requested more time to prepare for the agency’s fiduciary rule for retirement accounts. The rule is scheduled to go into effect on Dec. 20. Campbell said extra breathing room would be important for small investment advisory firms. They need more time to adjust their policies and procedures and train staff for the fiduciary rule, he continued.  “A lot of smaller RIAs don’t understand the magnitude of the work necessary to comply by December,” explained Campbell, former head of the Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) during the George W. Bush administration. “It’s entirely possible a lot of RIAs won’t be in full compliance by December despite their best efforts.”  The other challenge facing RIAs is that they assume they’re in the clear on a fiduciary rule because they charge flat fees for advice rather than receiving variable compensation from third parties, Campbell noted. But they will need to rely on the DOL rule’s exemption because recommending a rollover will create a new revenue stream for them.  “A lot of RIAs think of themselves as the fiduciary ‘good guys,’” Campbell said. However, according to the publication, everyone can be a “bad guy” under the DOL rule. “Whether your compensation is a flat fee or a commission, it’s still going to be a prohibited transaction for rollover recommendations,” Campbell added."

European Securities Markets Authority,SMSG Advice on ESMA 2022 annual Work Programme,ESMA | ESMA Library | Documents,European Securities and Markets Authority,"SMSG Advice on ESMA 2022 annual Work Programme  28/09/2021  Securities and Markets Stakeholder Group    ESMA SMSG • CS 60747 – 103 rue de Grenelle • 75345 Paris Cedex 07 • Tel. +33 (0) 1 58 36 43 21 • www.esma.europa.eu/smsg   I.  Introduction   On 29 July 2021, the SMSG received ESMA’s draft annual work programme, with a request for our written   comments by 23 August 2021. The SMSG highly appreciates the opportunity to provide input on ESMA’s   Work Programme and provides ESMA with the following advice.   The SMSG generally supports ESMA’s draft Work Programme, and particularly welcomes the sustained   emphasis  on  supervisory convergence  across  the different areas  of ESMA’s competences, while  being   mindful of the effect on the actual European market practices.   While the SMSG generally agrees with the focus of the draft Work Programme, it advises ESMA to re-  consider the scope and emphasis of certain points of its work programme.   II.  Investors and issuers   1.  The SMSG is of the opinion that financial education and literacy are very important areas (p. 9 and 13).   In the opinion of the SMSG the Work Programme is somewhat underdeveloped in this area. The SMSG   therefore  asks  ESMA  to  elaborate  its  work  programme  in  this  field,  with  clearly  stated  goals  and   deliverables. For instance, in the field of ESG, ESMA could envisage to work on a project of education   on ESG data reporting.   2.  The SMSG advises ESMA to extend its investor protection focus to crypto assets. There is a lot of   volatility and insecurity in this area, while reliable information is scarce. Nevertheless, this market is   attracting many investors, who may permanently loose trust in investing, including investing in capital   markets.   3.  ESMA announces that it aims at improving its ability to reach out to investors' representatives to receive   direct feedback and input (p. 16). The SMSG is fully supportive of this initiative but advises ESMA to   develop in more detail how it will realize this. The SMSG also wonders whether a similar initiative is   needed at the other end of the value chain, namely the representatives of issuers.   III.  Benchmarks   4.  ESMA intends to monitor the transition from EONIA and Libor in the OTC derivatives market (p. 30).   The SMSG advises to include in its monitoring exercise the transition in the cash markets as well.   IV.  Risk monitoring   5.  ESMA’s risk monitoring is of key importance to the European capital markets and is part of core ESMA   activities  (p.  36-37).  The  Commission,  more  specifically,  requested  the  European  Supervisory   Authorities to issue recurrent reports on the cost and past performance of the main categories of retail   investment,  insurance  and  pension  products  (Ares(2017)5008790),  implementing  the  action   Date: 23 August 2021   ESMA22-106-3523   ADVICE TO ESMA   SMSG advice to ESMA on its draft 2022 annual Work Programme   2   announced  in  the  Commission  communication  on  the Mid Term Review of the Capital Markets   Union of 8 June 2017.    6.  However, when it comes to cost and performance, the TRV reports and the annual statistical reports   of ESMA are still based on data not proprietary to ESMA, including from commercial data providers   (e.g. Morningstar or Refinitiv). The Commission request stated that ESA reporting should be based on   data and information originating from disclosures and reporting already required by Union law (e.g.   UCITS,  MiFID/MiFIR,  IDD,  IORP  and  PRIIPs)  or  national  legislations,  and  collected  in  a  direct  or   indirect manner.  The request specified that the ESA reports may be based on already available but   potentially incomplete databases, but that alternatively, the collection of limited sample of data from the   product manufacturers may be foreseen.      7.  Previous ESMA reports on costs and performance have been based on both disclosures and reporting   already  required  by  Union  law  (e.g.  UCITS,  MiFID/MiFIR,  IDD,  IORP  and  PRIIPs)  and  data  from   commercial data providers. However, the UCITS KIID is set to be replaced by the PRIIPs KID in due   course, whereas the latter does not contain information on past performance and costs. This means   that the data which ESMA can obtain from disclosures and reporting required by Union law will become   more incomplete.    8.  The  independent,  reliable  and  comprehensive  assessment  of  the  costs  and  performance  of  retail   investment products is, however, essential for investors’ trust, for effective capital markets funding and   for pension adequacy.    9.  The SMSG, therefore, calls on ESMA to work on building up an independent pan-European database   with information on cost and performance for UCITS and AIFs and to build up own intelligence in that   respect. In this regard, article 9(1)(a) of ESMA Regulation indeed not only requires ESMA to analyze   and report on consumer and market trends, such as the actual returns and the development of costs   and charges of retail financial services and products, but also to collect the relevant data.   V.  Competitiveness   10.  A particular concern of the SMSG recently (and this was highlighted in our report on the ESA review)   was to ensure that ESMA should have a sufficient focus on the competitiveness of EU financial markets,   in order to facilitate the achievement of CMU objectives.    11.  In this  light the  SMSG  urges  ESMA to include  in  its  Work  Programme  the  proactive  monitoring  of   regulatory developments in third-countries and notably in the UK, which could have an impact on the   relative competitiveness and attractiveness of EU financial markets. In the current version of the Work   Programme, consideration of third-country regimes seems to focus on the status-quo rather than on   the direction of travel. In terms of ensuring competitiveness of EU markets, the SMSG advises ESMA   to explicitly include a more forward-looking approach (section 3.1.1). This is all the more important in   view of DLT technology that will possibly replace settlement as we know it today (see LINK).   12.  The SMSG further advises ESMA to develop a strategy allowing to take into account the impact of its   Work  Programme  especially  on  smaller  markets.  There  is  a  concern  that  when  ESMA  takes  over   supervision  on  critical  benchmark  administrators  and  APA's,  this  may  introduce  an  increased  and   disproportional regulatory cost on smaller exchanges or APA operators and may cause some of them   to  discontinue  their  services,  as  they  are  providing  this  service  locally  and  for  relatively  small   transactions.    3   13.  More generally, each regulatory step should be accompanied with an analysis of how the cost of the   measure will be distributed in the market and there should be an overall assessment of the regulatory   cost  on  market  participants  (brokers,  exchanges,  CSDs,  Issuers,  users).  Costs  are  indeed  often   mentioned as main obstacle for a higher number of listings, while on the other hand, more listings of   SMEs is a key objective of CMU.    This advice will be published on the Securities and Markets Stakeholder Group section of ESMA’s website.   Adopted on 23 August 2021,   [signed]   Veerle Colaert   Chair   Securities and Markets Stakeholder Group   "

We have compiled the following chronology table which serves as a quick reference point to track the circulars and guidance published by HK financial services regulators in relation to COVID-19. We will update the table regularly. Kindly note that the table is not intended to capture all regulatory publications on an exhaustive basis.  Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) Circulars/Guidelines  The SFC published a Circular on 19 July 2021 regarding further updates to the Exemption Scheme. The further updates are made in light of the adjustments to the quarantine requirements for vaccinated persons arriving in Hong Kong announced by the HKSAR Government. The key updates include shortening the period of itinerary and point-to-point transportation requirements for inbound travellers (who have stayed in high or medium risk places specified in Group B or Group C under Cap. 599H or Taiwan, China during the 14 days prior to their arrival in Hong Kong and who possess a positive result of a recognised serology antibody test) to the first seven days instead of the entire 14-day medical surveillance period. The Department of Health and Food and Health Bureau has also updated their ""Guidelines for vehicles providing point-to-point transportation arrangements for exempted persons (air crew, sea crew and others)"".  Accordingly, the SFC has adjusted their requirements for the submission of attestation forms under the Exemption Scheme. Sponsored licensed corporations should submit a signed attestation form:  a. for a returning executive, on his or her third and seventh days in Hong Kong;  b. for a visiting executive,  i. on the last day of his or her trip if he or she stays in Hong Kong for less than three days; or  ii. on his or her third day in Hong Kong, and on the seventh day in Hong Kong or the last day of his or her trip, whichever is earlier, if he or she stays in Hong Kong for more than three days.  Please refer to Appendix II to the Circular for the updated attestation form.  The antibody testing and COVID-19 testing (post-arrival test) requirements of the Exemption Scheme are also updated as follows:  a. the list of recognised laboratories and criteria have been updated to align with the Government's announcements;  b. the specification that specimens must be collected for an antibody test on the day of arrival or the following day has been removed; and  c. the post-arrival test on the seventh day will be advanced to the fifth day in Hong Kong.  Please refer to Appendix I to the Circular for the revisions to the exemption conditions and requirements.  The Circular should be read in conjunction with the SFC's earlier Circular on Exemption for senior executives of licensed corporations issued on 28 May 2021 (Exemption Scheme) and Updates to the Exemption Scheme issued on 21 June 2021.

Circular to licensed corporations – Business continuity planning in view of COVID-19 Vaccination Programme   The SFC published a Circular identifying vaccination as key element of operational risk management and strongly encouraging licensed corporations to consider vaccination as a critical part of operational risk management to ensure their business operations and client interests are not unduly affected by COVID-19. The SFC urges licensed corporations to:  (a) review their business continuity plan (BCP) and identify functions which are critical to their business operations and client interests and encourage staff performing such critical functions, for example client-facing and critical support staff, to get vaccinated. Licensed corporations are also reminded to maintain proper documentation of any changes to their BCPs; and  (b) consider suitable arrangements for critical staff who have not yet been vaccinated or are unfit for vaccination due to medical conditions to undergo periodic COVID-19 testing.  The goal is to keep driving down infection rates, interrupt community transmission and uplift COVID-related restrictions in order to return to a high level of normalcy.   The SFC published a Circular informing licensed corporations that the Government has designated certain categories of persons in the financial services sector to be exempted from the compulsory quarantine arrangements in Hong Kong under Cap. 599C and Cap. 599E (“Exemption Scheme”). Senior executives of licensed corporations or their overseas affiliates who are fully vaccinated and meet the eligibility criteria may apply for exemption from the compulsory quarantine arrangements when they return or travel to Hong Kong.  In short, this is not an automatic exemption. Applications must be made in advance and there are limited quotas. The SFC has sole discretion whether to approve or refuse an application.  Who are eligible to apply for exemption  1. senior executives travelling from and returning to Hong Kong, namely, senior executives of a licensed corporation with global or regional roles who are returning to Hong Kong after travelling to foreign places primarily for the purposes of managing the group entities for which they have responsibility (“returning executives”); and  2. senior executives visiting Hong Kong, namely, global or regional heads or senior executives of financial institutions that a licensed corporation is affiliated with, who are travelling to Hong Kong primarily for the purposes of managing the licensed corporation (“visiting executives”).  Limited quota  3. The quotas are limited to two entries for returning executives and two entries for visiting executives, respectively, per calendar month per licensed corporation.  Application procedures  4. Applications for exemption should be made by the sponsoring licensed corporation of the returning executives or the visiting executives, by completing the prescribed application form (see Appendix I to the Circular) and providing the requisite supporting documents set out in the Circular, including an itinerary of the proposed exempted executive for the entire duration of the trip (for a visiting executive) or throughout the entire medical surveillance period (for a returning executive) in Hong Kong, with information about his or her arrival, departure, accommodation or designated quarantine hotel, organisations and venues to be visited with the dates and times of the visits. Please also follow the application procedures set out in the Circular.  Requirements on exempted executives and their sponsoring licensed corporations  5. Each exempted executive is required to fully comply with the specific conditions for exemptions set out in the authorisation letter issued by the FSTB and is only allowed to leave his or her designated quarantine hotel or accommodation arranged by the sponsoring licensed corporation for approved activities set out in the itinerary. A set of sample conditions is set out in the Notes appended to the application form for reference. These conditions include the completion of a COVID-19 vaccination course; pre-departure, on arrival and post-arrival COVID-19 tests; point-to-point transportation; self-isolation and medical surveillance.  6.Each sponsoring licensed corporation is required to:  (a) keep an up-to-date record of the itinerary of each exempted executive for the entire duration of the trip (for a visiting executive) or throughout the entire medical surveillance period (for a returning executive) in Hong Kong. The itinerary maintained by the sponsoring licensed corporation should also include information about the contact details of the persons who had met or would meet with the exempted executive in Hong Kong. Any changes to the itinerary should be submitted to the SFC upon arrival in Hong Kong and at the time when the sponsoring licensed corporation submits the attestation form as required under item(d) below;  (b) ensure compliance with the guidelines for vehicles providing point-to-point transportation (see Appendix III to the Circular);  (c) ensure that, for exempted persons in self-isolation at an accommodation arranged by the sponsoring licensed corporation, the Department of Health's infection control guidelines are adhered to;  (d) submit to the SFC an attestation form (in the form prescribed in Appendix II to the Circular) signed by a responsible officer or the manager-in-charge of compliance function of the sponsoring licensed corporation, every three working days or at the half-way point of the trip, whichever is earlier, and on the last day of the trip (for a visiting executive) or the medical surveillance period (for a returning executive); and  (e) report to the SFC as soon as possible if an exempted executive is confirmed or suspected to be infected with COVID-19 during his or her trip in Hong Kong and within 14 days after departing Hong Kong (for a visiting executive) or during the medical surveillance period (for a returning executive).  Consequence of violation  Any contravention with the exemption conditions would result in removal of the exemption status. In addition, if an exempted person who is subject to self-isolation in a designated quarantine hotel room is found to have breached the self-isolation requirement, the concerned exempted person's exemption status will be removed immediately and he / she will be sent to the HKSAR Government's Quarantine Centre for compulsory quarantine for 21 days. An exempted person who fails to observe any of the conditions commits an offence and, on conviction, will be liable to a fine of HK$5,000 and to imprisonment for 6 months.  The sponsoring licensed corporations are responsible for ensuring the accuracy and authenticity of the information submitted as part of the Exemption Scheme, and such responsibility ultimately rests with the senior management of each sponsoring licensed corporation.

The SFC published a circular informing licensed corporations (LCs) that the SFC will defer the introduction of initial margin (IM) requirements for non-centrally cleared over-the-counter (OTC) derivative transactions by one year to provide operational relief in light of the COVID-19 outbreak.

Commodity Exchange Act,"Kraken Hit by $1.25 Million Penalty Imposed by CFTC, Commissioner Stump Calls Decision “Uncharted Territory”",Crowdfund Insider | Crowdfunding Portals,Crowdfund Insider,"Kraken Hit by $1.25 Million Penalty Imposed by CFTC, Commissioner Stump Calls Decision “Uncharted Territory”  Kraken (Payward Ventures, Inc), a digital asset trading platform, has been hit by a $1.25 million penalty imposed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). According to a statement by the CFTC, Kraken offered illegal off-exchange trading in digital asetss and failed to register as required.  The CFTC’s order finds that from approximately June 2020 to July 2021, Kraken offered margined retail commodity transactions in digital assets to US customers who were not eligible contract participants. According to the order, Kraken served as the sole margin provider and maintained physical and/or constructive custody of all assets purchased using margin for the duration of a customer’s open margined position.  Acting Director of Enforcement at the CFTC, Vincent McGonagle, stated:  This action is part of the CFTC’s broader effort to protect U.S. customers. Margined, leveraged or financed digital asset trading offered to retail U.S. customers must occur on properly registered and regulated exchanges in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.”  The order requires Kraken to pay a $1.25 million civil monetary penalty and to cease and desist from further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), as charged.  Simultaneously, Commissioner Dawn Stump has issued an independent statement on the CFTC’s enforcement action. Commissioner Stump called the decision “uncharted territory” recognizing the challenge of the new digital asset ecosystem. Commissioner Stump’s statement is republished below.  I concur with the Commission’s settlement Order regarding Payward Ventures, Inc. (d/b/a Kraken). As described in the Order:  Kraken is a digital asset company whose primary business is the operation of an online digital asset exchange. The exchange enables customers to engage in retail commodity transactions – specifically, the purchase and sale of digital assets, including Bitcoin.[1]  I write separately to comment on certain implications of the Commission’s findings that Kraken: 1) engaged in prohibited retail commodity transactions in violation of Section 4(a) of the Commodity Exchange Act (“CEA”)[2]; and 2) operated as an unregistered futures commission merchant (“FCM”) in violation of Section 4d(a)(1) of the CEA.[3]  The Prohibited Retail Commodity Transactions Finding: Codifying our Guidance  Although it is not mentioned in the settlement Order, the Commission’s finding that Kraken engaged in prohibited retail commodity transactions is informed by its Final Interpretive Guidance on retail commodity transactions involving certain digital assets issued in 2020 (the “Guidance”).[4] Kraken’s conduct as described in the Order aligns with some of the illustrative examples discussed in the Guidance, and it can be no coincidence that the Order defines the “Relevant Period” as beginning in June 2020 – three months after then-Chairman Tarbert announced in March 2020 “that for a period of 90 days the CFTC will forbear from initiating enforcement actions addressing aspects of [the Guidance] that were not plainly evident from prior CFTC guidance, enforcement actions, and case law.”[5]  At the time, I agreed that the Guidance “provide[d] an efficient and flexible way to communicate the agency’s current views on how the actual delivery exception in Section 2(c)(2)(D) [of the CEA bringing certain retail commodity transactions within the scope of Section 4(a)] may apply in various situations.”[6] However, as the Guidance becomes increasingly relevant to the Commission’s enforcement program, I believe it is incumbent upon the Commission to undertake a rulemaking proceeding to supersede the Guidance by adopting binding and enforceable rules that will provide certainty to the marketplace and a shared understanding of the “rules of the road.”[7]  Guidance has its place, of course. But I have spoken before of the benefits of codifying interpretations issued by our staff where appropriate,[8] which accrue in equal measure to the codification of Commission guidance as well. And this particular Guidance, as then-Commissioner Behnam noted at the time, was adopted nearly two-and-a-half years after it was proposed, and more than two years after the public comment period had ended. I agree with his observation that “[i]n the rapidly developing world of digital assets, two years is a lifetime”[9] – and yet now we are an additional year-and-a-half later still. I believe, therefore, that the Commission should act to replace the Guidance with rules that are based on current input from market participants and members of the public.[10]  The Unregistered FCM Finding: Clarifying Our Regulatory Authority  As recounted in the Guidance, the Commission has long held that certain speculative commodity transactions involving leverage are futures contracts that, pursuant to Section 4(a) of the CEA, must be traded on a designated contract market (a “DCM” – or, in non-CEA language, a futures exchange – that is subject to Commission oversight). However, court decisions called that view into question with respect to certain leveraged transactions involving retail participants.[11]  In the Dodd-Frank Act,[12] Congress added Section 2(c)(2)(D) to the CEA to make clear that these retail commodity transactions must be traded on a DCM pursuant to CEA Section 4(a) “as if” they are futures contracts. But it did not comprehensively address how these transactions are to be regulated – and, in the decade since the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted, nor has the Commission.  The Commission finds that Kraken violated CEA Section 4(a) because it engaged in retail commodity transactions that are prohibited by the CEA unless traded on or subject to the rules of a DCM – a registration designation that has neither been requested by nor granted to Kraken. But it also finds that Kraken operated as an unregistered FCM with respect to those transactions, which begs the question: If Kraken had sought to register with the Commission as an FCM, how would it have been expected to operate? Absent these transactions occurring on a DCM, they would continue to be illegal even if Kraken had an FCM registration. Furthermore, how Kraken would be regulated as an FCM is not entirely clear, because many of the Commission’s rules governing its regulation of traditional FCMs do not fit Kraken’s role as an exchange. It also would be unprecedented for an entity to register as both a DCM and an FCM.  In short, the application of the Commission’s FCM rules to an exchange on which retail commodity transactions are traded is uncharted territory at this time. I agree that Kraken’s activities meet the definition of an FCM set out in the CEA,[13] and that Kraken thus operated as an FCM without registering as such (though I would note this is a rather broad interpretation of the definition beyond the traditional application). I believe that if the Commission is going to hold an exchange liable for operating as an unregistered FCM with respect to retail commodity transactions, it is incumbent upon the Commission to explain in a transparent manner the relevant legal requirements for such an entity that seeks to register as an FCM and how the Commission will apply them in enabling the entity to conduct business with U.S. customers.

Commodity Exchange Act,CFTC hits Kraken with $1.25M in fines over alleged illegal offering,Fintastico | Fintech Radar,Fintastico,"CFTC hits Kraken with $1.25M in fines over alleged illegal offering  “Margined, leveraged or financed digital asset trading offered to retail U.S. customers must occur on properly registered and regulated exchanges in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations,” said Vincent McGonagle, the CFTC’s acting director of enforcement.  The United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or CFTC, is ordering crypto exchange Kraken to pay more than a million dollars in civil monetary penalties related to allegations the exchange is violating the Commodity Exchange Act.  In a Sept. 28 statement, the CFTC said U.S.-based crypto exchange Kraken — operating under the name Payward Ventures — has failed to register as a futures commission merchant and is illegally offering margined retail commodity transactions in digital assets. The order requires the exchange to pay a penalty of $1.25 million and “cease and desist from further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act,” the law under which the CFTC derives much of its enforcement power on commodities and futures trading.  “This action is part of the CFTC’s broader effort to protect U.S. customers,” said Vincent McGonagle, the CFTC’s acting director of enforcement. “Margined, leveraged or financed digital asset trading offered to retail U.S. customers must occur on properly registered and regulated exchanges in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.”  The CFTC’s case alleges that Kraken “offered margined retail commodity transactions in digital assets” to ineligible U.S. customers from June 2020 to July 2021. Kraken has since changed its policy on margin trading, but until June 2021 customers needed to close or settle their positions within 28 days. According to CFTC, these actions represented the company operating illegally as the transactions did not occur on a designated contract market.  “If repayment was not made within 28 days, Kraken could unilaterally force the margin position to be liquidated,” alleged the CFTC. “Kraken could also initiate a forced liquidation if the value of the collateral dipped below a certain threshold percentage of the total outstanding margin. As a result, actual delivery of the purchased assets failed to occur.”  Related: US crypto exchange Kraken eyeing public listing in 2022  The enforcement action is seemingly small compared to the size of a major crypto exchange like Kraken — some estimates put the company at a $10 billion valuation, with the monetary penalty representing 0.0125% of that value. In contrast, the CFTC and Financial Crimes Enforcement Network fined crypto derivatives exchange BitMEX $100 million in August.  Dan Berkovitz, current CFTC commissioner and soon to be Securities and Exchange Commission general counsel, has previously described the former’s enforcement actions in the crypto space as “aggressive,” but also said the agency was “not necessarily looking for more authority without more resources.” Berkovitz will be leaving the CFTC in October while U.S. President Joe Biden has tapped Kristin Johnson and Christy Goldsmith Romero to fill two of the empty commissioner seats at the agency."

On February 11, 2021, Fusion Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation (""Fusion"" or the ""Company""), entered into an agreement and plan of merger by and among Fusion, ML Merger Sub Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Fusion (""Merger Sub""), and MoneyLion Inc. (""MoneyLion"") (as amended on June 28, 2021 and September 4, 2021, the ""Merger Agreement""), which provided for Merger Sub to merge with and into MoneyLion with MoneyLion surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Fusion (the ""Business Combination""). The Business Combination was consummated on September 22, 2021. In addition, in connection with the consummation of the Business Combination, Fusion was renamed ""MoneyLion Inc."" and is referred to herein as ""New MoneyLion"" as of the time following such change of name.  Under the Merger Agreement, Fusion had agreed to acquire all of the outstanding equity interests of MoneyLion for $2.2 billion in aggregate consideration. The aggregate consideration paid to MoneyLion stockholders was (i) 184,285,695 shares of Class A common stock of New MoneyLion (valued at $10.00 per share) and (ii) the contingent right to receive a pro rata portion of up to 17,500,000 shares of Class A common stock of New MoneyLion (the ""Earn Out Shares"").  The Private Placement  On February 11, 2021, concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Fusion entered into the Subscription Agreements with the PIPE Investors, pursuant to which, among other things, Fusion agreed to issue and sell in private placements an aggregate of 25,000,000 shares of Fusion Class A common stock to the PIPE Investors for $10.00 per share.  The Private Placement closed immediately prior to the Closing of the Business Combination. In connection with the Closing, all of the issued and outstanding shares of Fusion Class A common stock, including the shares of Fusion Class A common stock issued to the PIPE Investors, became shares of New MoneyLion Class A common stock.   The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements were prepared in accordance with Article 11 of SEC Regulation S-X as amended by the final rule, Release No. 33-10786 ""Amendments to Financial Disclosures about Acquired and Disposed Businesses."" Release No. 33-10786 replaces the existing pro forma adjustment criteria with simplified requirements to depict the accounting for the transaction (""Transaction Accounting Adjustments"") and present the reasonably estimable synergies and other transaction effects that have occurred or reasonably expected to occur (""Management's Adjustments""). Fusion has elected not to present Management's Adjustments and will only be presenting Transaction Accounting Adjustments in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. The adjustments presented in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements have been identified and presented to provide relevant information necessary for an understanding of the combined company upon consummation of the Business Combination and the Private Placement.  The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of June 30, 2021 gives effect to the Business Combination and the Private Placement as if they occurred as of June 30, 2021.

The pro forma adjustments reflecting the consummation of the Business Combination and the Private Placement are based on certain currently available information and certain assumptions and methodologies that Fusion believes are reasonable under the circumstances. The pro forma adjustments, which are described in the accompanying notes, may be revised as additional information becomes available and is evaluated. Therefore, it is likely that the actual adjustments will differ from the pro forma adjustments, and it is possible that the difference may be material. Fusion believes that its assumptions and methodologies provide a reasonable basis for presenting all of the significant effects of the Business Combination and the Private Placement based on information available to management at this time and that the pro forma adjustments give appropriate effect to those assumptions and are properly applied in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information.

SAFE Banking Act,U.S. House Passes the SAFE Banking Act as Part of Defense Bill,The National Law Review | What's Trending,The National Law Review,"U.S. House Passes the SAFE Banking Act as Part of Defense Bill  The SAFE Banking Act passed in the U.S. House of Representatives for the fifth time on September 23, 2021. This landmark legislation would pave the way for more financial institutions to serve the state-legal cannabis industry by removing some of the attendant legal and regulatory risks, as we have previously explained.  In a tactical decision to help the Act finally get across the finish line in the Senate, Rep. Ed Perlmutter proposed that it be included as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The Act was added to the NDAA by voice vote on September 21, and the NDAA passed the House in a 316-113 vote on September 23.  But the Act still faces an uphill climb in the Senate, where some Democrats – including Majority Leader Chuck Schumer – are eyeing more comprehensive cannabis reform like the Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act, which we analyzed here. Sen. Sherrod Brown, who chairs the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, has also indicated that he supports tying the Act to broader cannabis reform rather than passing it as a standalone measure.  Despite these obstacles, the SAFE Banking Act does have broad bipartisan support, and its inclusion in the NDAA confirms that the Act remains a top legislative priority for Rep. Perlmutter. We will continue to keep you updated as the Act works its way through the Senate."

Transcript: CARES Act Oversight of the Treasury and Federal Reserve: Supporting an Equitable Pandemic Recovery  U.S. Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee  September 28, 2021  Senator Elizabeth Warren: Chair Powell, during your time as chair you've taken plenty of actions to weaken the Fed’s regulatory oversight of our largest banks. So today I want to talk about three instances of that, and ask you to think about them in hindsight. First, the stress test. Now these are designed to tell whether or not big banks can survive without a taxpayer bailout. When the tests were first set up, bank supervisors could restrict stock buybacks and dividend payments to strengthen the bank's balance sheet. In 2019, you took that power away and we now know from the Fed’s own research that when the economy hit choppy waters last year, those banks needed stimulus from the taxpayers, and without this taxpayer help, they would have faced up to $300 billion in losses, meaning that they were in a sharply weakened position to withstand the stress. Chair Powell, do you regret weakening the stress test?  Chair Jerome Powell: I don't think we have weakened the stress test and I'm not sure what you're referring to. When banks fail the stress test, their distributions are limited.  Senator Warren: So I laid it out here that you took away the power to restrict stock buybacks and dividend payments that could be used to strengthen the balance sheet. You don’t see any changes you made to the stress tests and handing the stress tests out in advance?  Chair Powell: Senator, capital in the largest banks is at multi-decade highs.  Senator Warren: That's not my question. I'm looking at the Fed’s own research, which says that without the help that you had to put into the economy last year, they would have faced up to $300 billion in losses. So, look, I don't want to argue with you about what’s happened-  Chair Powell: Which they would have met. Which they would have been able to absorb without difficulty.  Senator Warren: Let, let me ask you the question then. I take it you don't have any regrets about any changes to the stress test?  Chair Powell: I, not really. I mean I'm prepared to look at anything we did is, is fair game to look at again, but I don't think so.  Senator Warren: Ok. Let me ask about another action. In 2020, the Fed along with the other agencies, removed the Volcker Rule restrictions on whether banks could co-sponsor so-called family funds. And then earlier this year we watched the collapse of a “Family Fun” called Archegos, which causes banks, caused banks to suffer a quick $10 billion in losses. Given the Archegos collapse, do you regret weakening the Volcker rule?  Chair Powell: You know the, that's actually a family office, Archegos is. I don't know that there are any Volcker Rule implications for Archegos. I will say, we've looked at the Archegos situation closely. Those losses were, and I think learn, learned our lessons from that.  Senator Warren: Learn your lessons, but do you have any regrets about weakening the Volcker Rule around family funds, having watched what Archegos did?  Chair Powell: I’d have to understand the Archegos connection. Generally the, it was widely agreed that the Volcker rule as implemented was complex and not workable.  Senator Warren: Ok. I’ll take that as a no. I just want to make sure I can get through all three of these. One last example, in 2019, the Fed weakened liquidity requirements, the rules that ensure that firms have adequate cash to meet their obligations. For banks between $250 and $700 billion dollars in assets, the liquidity requirement was cut by 15%. So, let me just ask, do you regret slashing liquidity requirements designed to protect markets from crashing like they did in 2008?  Chair Powell: So that was, that was tailoring which, which the law that had been passed through this committee required, I don't, I don't see that there has been any evidence that that was a bad idea, but it's one that could certainly be looked at again.  Senator Warren: Okay, so you'd be willing to at least look at that one again?  Chair Powell: Yes.  Senator Warren: Yeah, okay, this cut by 15%. You know Chair Powell, the elephant in the room is, whether you're going to be re-nominated for a second term as Fed Chair.  Re-nominating you means gambling that for the next five years, a Republican majority at the Federal Reserve with a Republican chair, who has regularly voted to deregulate Wall Street, won't drive this economy over a financial cliff again. And with so many qualified candidates for this job, I just don't think that's a risk worth taking.  I know that some argue that your deregulatory actions are mostly harmless. I disagree. I think they've put taxpayers at risk for hundreds of billions of dollars, but even at that, so far you've been lucky. But the 2008 crash shows what happens when the luck runs out. The seeds of the 2008 crash were planted years in advance by major regulators like the Federal Reserve, that refuse to rein in big banks.  I came to Washington after the 2008 crash to make sure that nothing like that would ever happen again. Your record gives me grave concern. Over and over, you have acted to make our banking system less safe. And that makes you a dangerous man to head up the Fed, and it's why I will oppose your renomination. Thank you Mr. Chair.  ###"

I don't know that there are any Volcker Rule implications for Archegos. I will say, we've looked at the Archegos situation closely. Those losses were, and I think learn, learned our lessons from that.  Senator Warren: Learn your lessons, but do you have any regrets about weakening the Volcker Rule around family funds, having watched what Archegos did?  Chair Powell: I’d have to understand the Archegos connection. Generally the, it was widely agreed that the Volcker rule as implemented was complex and not workable.  Senator Warren: Ok. I’ll take that as a no. I just want to make sure I can get through all three of these. One last example, in 2019, the Fed weakened liquidity requirements, the rules that ensure that firms have adequate cash to meet their obligations. For banks between $250 and $700 billion dollars in assets, the liquidity requirement was cut by 15%. So, let me just ask, do you regret slashing liquidity requirements designed to protect markets from crashing like they did in 2008?  Chair Powell: So that was, that was tailoring which, which the law that had been passed through this committee required, I don't, I don't see that there has been any evidence that that was a bad idea, but it's one that could certainly be looked at again.  Senator Warren: Okay, so you'd be willing to at least look at that one again?  Chair Powell: Yes.  Senator Warren: Yeah, okay, this cut by 15%. You know Chair Powell, the elephant in the room is, whether you're going to be re-nominated for a second term as Fed Chair.  Re-nominating you means gambling that for the next five years, a Republican majority at the Federal Reserve with a Republican chair, who has regularly voted to deregulate Wall Street, won't drive this economy over a financial cliff again. And with so many qualified candidates for this job, I just don't think that's a risk worth taking.  I know that some argue that your deregulatory actions are mostly harmless. I disagree. I think they've put taxpayers at risk for hundreds of billions of dollars, but even at that, so far you've been lucky. But the 2008 crash shows what happens when the luck runs out. The seeds of the 2008 crash were planted years in advance by major regulators like the Federal Reserve, that refuse to rein in big banks.  I came to Washington after the 2008 crash to make sure that nothing like that would ever happen again. Your record gives me grave concern. Over and over, you have acted to make our banking system less safe. And that makes you a dangerous man to head up the Fed, and it's why I will oppose your renomination. Thank you Mr. Chair.  ###"

Fair Debt Collection Practices Act,CA DFPI brings first enforcement action against a debt collector and debt buyer for violating the state’s Consumer Financial...,JD Supra | Finance & Banking Posts,JD Supra,"CA DFPI brings first enforcement action against a debt collector and debt buyer for violating the state’s Consumer Financial...  Last week, the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) brought its first enforcement action against a debt collector and debt buyer for violating the state’s Consumer Financial Protection Law (CCFPL). The DFPI’s Desist and Refrain Order and Order Assessing Penalties (totaling $375,000) charges F & F Management Inc. (F&F) with violating the CCFPL by (1) engaging in unfair acts and practices, and (2) and violating the CA Rosenthal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (Rosenthal), the CA Consumer Credit Reporting Agencies Act (CCRAA), and the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA). The CCFPL makes it unlawful for a covered person to engage in any unlawful, unfair, deceptive, or abusive act or practice with respect to consumer financial services or products or to offer or provide a consumer financial product or service not it conformity with any consumer financial law.  The DFPI charges F&F with violating Rosenthal by leaving automated messages for consumers in which it made false representations and threats to take action prohibited by the Rosenthal Act, including that it had commenced legal proceedings when it had not done so and would contact the consumer’s employer.  It also charges F&F with engaging in unfair acts and practices in violation of the CCFPL and with violating the CCRAA by engaging in “debt parking.” This practice, also referred to as “passive debt collection,” involves the placing of purported debts on consumers’ credit reports without first attempting to communicate with consumers about the debts. (In December 2020, the FTC announced a settlement of its first enforcement action targeting “debt parking.” In addition, the CFPB’s final debt collection rules, which become effective November 30, 2021, prohibit reporting debts to consumer reporting agencies until after a debt collector attempt to make contact with the consumer.)  F&F is also charged with violating Rosenthal and the FDCPA by failing to provide validation notices and falsely representing that additional amounts would be added to consumers’ debts if they were not paid. (F&F’s FDCPA violations are charged both directly and indirectly as Rosenthal violations. Rosenthal requires “debt collectors,” a term that includes first-party collections, to comply with the FDCPA.)"

DOL Conflict of Interest Rule,How Do You Prep For The Coming IRA Rollover Fiduciary Rule?,Sutherland Asbill & Brennan | Financial Services,Sutherland Asbill & Brennan,"How Do You Prep For The Coming IRA Rollover Fiduciary Rule?  Eversheds Sutherland Partner Carol McClarnon is quoted in this article by Fiduciary News discussing the upcoming IRA Rollover Fiduciary Rule, which the Department of Labor created in 2020. The new conflict-of-interest Fiduciary Rule requires any investment adviser, including SEC Registered Investment Advisers, to document their ‘conflict-of-interest’ in selling their services to IRA Rollovers. ""ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code prohibit fiduciaries from engaging in certain ‘prohibited transactions’ involving self-dealing,"" Carol said. ""What this means essentially is that a fiduciary may not use its fiduciary authority to cause itself (or someone in which it has an interest) to get paid additional compensation. So, if an investment advice fiduciary advises a retirement investor to make an investment, and that specific recommendation results in the fiduciary getting paid more money, there is a potential prohibited transaction concern. On rollovers, the DOL is essentially saying there is a conflict because if the investor accepts the rollover advice the investment professional gets paid, but if there is no rollover advice, the investment professional receives no money.""

European Securities Markets Authority,How to trade oil and gas (part two),FXStreet | Commodities,FXStreet,"How to trade oil and gas (part two)  Oil, gas, and other energy news is everywhere, but how can you actually get started with investing in all this? Read on and find out.  You might be thinking about using stocks, ETFs, CFDs, or futures to trade oil and gas. Well, picking the right instrument depends on many factors such as types of businesses, regions, risk profiles, and psychology.  In the first episode we focused mainly on non-leveraged securities (stocks and ETFs) linked to the energy industry by showing some stable and/or fast-growing stocks and indexes. The second part is devoted to leveraged instruments such as CFDs and futures contracts.  Contracts for Difference (CFDs) & Fraction of Stocks  A Contract for Difference (CFD) is an OTC (over-the-counter) derivative contract that is replicating the price moves of its underlying asset. Many retail brokers offer those contracts, allowing to trade a wide range of products (incl. forex, indexes, commodities and now stocks). Such OTC contracts were banned in the U.S. due to the fact that trades are not passing through regulated exchanges. In Europe they are allowed, even though a broker that offers them has to comply with a layer of regulations which were put in place by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) a few years ago. These regs were notably set to limit the leverage (as some brokers were previously offering up to 1:200 or 1:500 leverages), consequently increasing the margin requirements, and – this is, in my opinion, something that turned out to be their main advantage – to offer guaranteed stops!  Indeed, those “guaranteed stops” switch the execution risk into the broker’s side. Since the execution of such stops is guaranteed at the set price, you don’t worry too much about any slippage... Another advantage of trading CFDs is that you can decide which fraction of your capital you want to allocate to your trade since those are non-standardized contracts. Therefore, if you are a beginner, you can trade mini (0.1) or even smaller micro-contracts (0.01). This specificity allowed many brokers to offer their retail clients the option to invest in a fraction of stocks. So, let’s say you’ve got a $5000 portfolio, and you want to buy an Amazon share that is currently trading at $3300.  Thus, if you bought one full stock at that price, then it would mean that 2/3rd (66%) of your portfolio would be exposed to Amazon’s stock price fluctuations, and you wouldn’t have the possibility to get a good diversification ratio. But if you were able to buy a custom-made fraction of that share, then you could potentially decide that you just want to invest in 1/6th of that Amazon stock. By doing so, you would only have $550 of your portfolio exposed to Amazon’s stock price fluctuations, which is an 11% risk in equity instead of 66%! If you want to learn more about those contracts, you will find a lot of information on the Web… Since we are not affiliated with any broker, we won’t suggest any of them, as this would present an obvious conflict of interests. So, please do your own research prior to investing or trading.  Futures Contracts  Futures contracts are standardized (centralized) derivative contracts allowing traders to obtain fairly good liquidity when they place trades through regulated exchanges. Furthermore, they can trade with certain leverage, which implies some margin requirements. Given the fact that margin requirements which allow to trade full futures contracts may be a barrier to retail traders, the main exchanges have created new products to decrease their margin requirements, allowing traders to get smaller exposure and better size their position. This helps hedgers get a more accurate hedge when they cover their physical trades, notably with the use of currency E-Mini/E-Micro futures contracts to cover the exchange risk.  So, it goes without saying that futures attract more and more players to take part in the markets.  Regarding the energy sector in particular, at Sunshine Profits we set our focus on the main energy futures contracts, like West Texas Intermediate (WTI) Crude Oil (CL) and Henry Hub Natural Gas (NG), but occasionally we may also look at the Brent Crude Oil (B) and the petroleum refined products such as Reformulated Blend-stock for Oxygenate Blending (RBOB) Gasoline (RB), Heating Oil (HO), Low Sulphur Gasoil (G), Carbon Emissions, etc.  If you want to get some exposure to energies with less leverage, we are going to provide you with some ETF trackers which are highly correlated in the table below, with pros & cons:  WTI Crude Oil Futures:  CL (Exchange: CME Group)  Higher liquidity  No management fees  Higher leverage  24-hour access  Cross-margining  Tighter correlation to the physical market  Crude Oil ETFs:  USO/UCO/DBO/USL/SCO/OILK/OIL  Lower liquidity  Low management fee  Low leverage and less risk  Easy access to the market  Less maintenance (no forward-rolling)  Brent Crude Oil Futures:  B (Exchange: ICE)  Brent Crude Oil ETF:  BNO  Read more: ETF Database  Natural Gas Futures:  NG (Exchange: CME Group)  Natural Gas ETFs:  UNG/KOLD/BOIL/UNL/GAZ  RBOB Gasoline Futures:  RB (Exchange: CME Group)  Gasoline ETF:  UGA  Carbon Emissions Futures:  CC (CME Group)/EUA (ICE)  Carbon Allowances ETF:  KRBN/GRN  Ethanol Futures:  CU (CME Group)  Biofuel ETF:  FUE  Broad Energy Futures:  N/A  Broad Energy ETFs:  DBE/RJN/JJE  In conclusion, in this series, we explored not only all the different ways to trade Oil and Gas but also a broader range of products that allow to take advantage of the energy commodity price moves depending on the risk you want to take when trading instruments with bigger or smaller leverage.  In future articles, we might focus on the existing correlations between the above-mentioned futures contracts and some of their ETF equivalents, as well as study the price relationship between them.

The order requires Symphony to pay a $100,000 civil monetary penalty and to cease and desist from any further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC regulations, as charged. Case Background The order finds that from about July 2019 to March 2021, Symphony violated the SEF registration requirement by operating""SPARC Tool"" on its communication platform. Symphony designed the web-based SPARC Tool to provide a technological tool for automated request for quote (RFQ) workflow for interest rate and cross currency swaps. SPARC Tool enabled multiple swap market participants to select swap product parameters, such as swap type, clearing preference, tenor, and notional size to populate RFQs. Those RFQs could be sent to multiple swap market participants. SPARC Tool then permitted swap market participants that received the RFQs to negotiate prices that could be acknowledged or confirmed using the command ""done."" After the Division of Enforcement began an inquiry into Symphony's unregistered activity, Symphony proactively identified and provided relevant information and thereafter took immediate steps to cease operation of its SPARC functionality. Accordingly, the civil monetary penalty is reduced to reflect Symphony's substantial cooperation and remediation. Division of Enforcement Staff responsible for this case are Ansley Schrimpf, Bryan Hsueh, Joseph Konizeski, Scott Williamson and Robert Howell. The Division of Market Oversight, and the Market Participants Division assisted in this matter. ***** Customers and other individuals can report suspicious activities or information, such as possible violations of commodity trading laws, to the Division of Enforcement via a toll-free hotline 866-FON-CFTC (866-366-2382), file a tip or complaint online, or contact the Whistleblower Office.

The order requires Symphony to pay a $100,000 civil monetary penalty and to cease and desist from any further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC regulations, as charged.                       Case Background                       The order finds that from about July 2019 to March 2021, Symphony violated the SEF registration requirement by operating""SPARC Tool"" on its communication platform. Symphony designed the web-based SPARC Tool to provide a technological tool for automated request for quote (RFQ) workflow for interest rate and cross currency swaps. SPARC Tool enabled multiple swap market participants to select swap product parameters, such as swap type, clearing preference, tenor, and notional size to populate RFQs. Those RFQs could be sent to multiple swap market participants. SPARC Tool then permitted swap market participants that received the RFQs to negotiate prices that could be acknowledged or confirmed using the command ""done.""                        After the Division of Enforcement began an inquiry into Symphony's unregistered activity, Symphony proactively identified and provided relevant information and thereafter took immediate steps to cease operation of its SPARC functionality. Accordingly, the civil monetary penalty is reduced to reflect Symphony's substantial cooperation and remediation.                       Division of Enforcement Staff responsible for this case are Ansley Schrimpf, Bryan Hsueh, Joseph Konizeski, Scott Williamson and Robert Howell. The Division of Market Oversight, and the Market Participants Division assisted in this matter.                       *****              Customers and other individuals can report suspicious activities or information, such as possible violations of commodity trading laws, to the Division of Enforcement via a toll-free hotline 866-FON-CFTC (866-366-2382), file a tip or complaint online, or contact the Whistleblower Office.

Commodity Exchange Act,The Division of Market Oversight of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission is issuing this advisory to remind entities of the swap execution facility registration requirements set forth in the Commodity Exchange Act and Commission regulations and to highlight certain scenarios where entities may be required to register.,MarketScreener.com | All Latest News,MarketScreener,"The Division of Market Oversight of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission is issuing this advisory to remind entities of the swap execution facility registration requirements set forth in the Commodity Exchange Act and Commission regulations and to highlight certain scenarios where entities may be required to register.  CFTC Letter No. 21-19 Advisories September 29, 2021 Division of Market Oversight Dorothy D. DeWitt Director Staff Advisory on Swap Execution Facility Registration Requirement The Division of Market Oversight (""DMO"") of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (""Commission"") is issuing this advisory (""Advisory"") to remind entities of the swap execution facility (""SEF"") registration requirements set forth in the Commodity Exchange Act (""CEA"") and Commission regulations and to highlight certain scenarios where entities may be required to register. This Advisory focuses on the application of the SEF registration requirement to entities : facilitating trading or execution of swaps through one-to-many or bilateral communications; facilitating trading or execution of swaps that are not subject to the trade execution requirement in CEA section 2(h)(8);1 (3) providing non-electronic means for the execution of swaps; or (4) falling within the SEF definition and operated by an entity currently registered with the Commission in some other capacity, such as a commodity trading advisor (""CTA"") or an introducing broker. The determination whether a facility meets the requirements to register as a SEF depends on all relevant facts and circumstances of its operations. A. Regulatory Background CEA section 5h(a)(1) establishes the SEF registration requirement, providing that no person may operate a facility for the trading or processing of swaps unless the facility is registered as a SEF or as a designated contract market (""DCM"").2 In 2013, the Commission adopted a final rule entitled ""Core Principles and Other Requirements for Swap Execution Facilities"" (""2013 Final Rule"").3 The 2013 Final Rule includes Commission Regulation 7 U.S.C. 2(h)(8). 7 U.S.C. 7b-3(a)(1). Core Principles and Other Requirements for Swap Execution Facilities, 78 FR 33476 (June 4, 2013). Although the Commission in November 2018 issued a proposed rulemaking to amend the various requirements established in the 2013 Final Rule, the Commission subsequently in February 2021 withdrew the remaining, unadopted portions of the November 2018 proposal. See Swap Execution Facilities and Trade Execution Requirement, 83 FR 61946 (Nov. 30, 2018) and Swap Execution Facilities and Trade Execution Requirement, 86 FR 9304 (Feb. 12, 2021) (""SEF Rule Withdrawal""), respectively. The adopted portions of the November 2018 proposal were directed at exemptions to the September 29, 2021 SEF Registration Advisory Page 2 37.3(a)(1),4 which sets forth the requirements for registration as a SEF. In the 2013 Final Rule, the Commission stated the statutory SEF registration requirement applies only to facilities meeting the SEF definition in CEA section 1a(50).5 CEA section 1a(50)6 defines a SEF as: a trading system or platform in which multiple participants have the ability to execute or trade swaps by accepting bids and offers made by multiple participants in the facility or system, through any means of interstate commerce, including any trading facility7, that- Facilitates the execution of swaps between persons; and (B) is not a designated contract market. DMO staff notes that the portion of the SEF statutory definition that states ""in which multiple participants have the ability to execute or trade swaps by accepting bids and offers made by multiple participants in the facility or system""8 is referred to herein as the ""multiple-to- multiple prong."" B. Application of the Registration Requirement 1. Facilities offering one-to-many or bilateral communications The multiple-to- multiple prong can be satisfied, and thus registration may be required, (i) even where multiple participants cannot simultaneously request, make, or accept bids and offers from multiple participants; or (ii) where multiple participants can initiate a one-to-many communication.9 Specifically, a facility meets the multiple-to-multiple prong if multiple participants have the ""ability to execute or trade swaps"" with multiple participants.10 In the 2013 Final Rule, the Commission stated a one-to-many system or platform on which the sponsoring entity is the counterparty to all swap contracts executed through the system or platform, and thus the provision of liquidity is limited to a single liquidity provider (i.e., the sponsoring entity) does not provide the ability for participants to conduct multiple-to-multiple execution or trading.11 In contrast, a one-to-many system or platform like a request for quote (""RFQ"") system-where a single requestor initiates for each transaction a one-to-many communication by submitting an RFQ to multiple participants-will satisfy the multiple-to- multiple prong if more than one participant is able to submit an RFQ on the platform. trade execution requirement and certain audit trail, post -trade allocation, financial resource and chief compliance officer requirements. For clarity and the avoidance of any doubt, DMO staff, consistent with the SEF Rule Withdrawal, states that those unadopted portions of the November 2018 proposal have been withdrawn by the Commission, and therefore, do not affect the application of the 2013 Final Rule. 17 CFR § 37.3(a)(1). Id. at 33481. 7 U.S.C. 1a(50). 7 U.S.C. 1a(51). 7 U.S.C. 1a(50). 9 The multiple-to-multip le prong is one component of the SEF registration requirement and is not determinative. 7 U.S.C. 1a(50) (emphasis added). 2013 Final Rule at 33482. See also id. at 33481 n. 87. (""The SEF [Notice of Proposed Rulemaking] stated that certain entities such as one-to-one voice services and single-dealer platforms do not provide the ability for participants to conduct multiple-to-multiple execution or trading because they limit the provision of liquidity to a single liquidity provider.""). September 29, 2021 SEF Registration Advisory Page 3 On several occasions, DMO staff reviewed facilities enabling market participants to communicate bids and offers to other market participants through a ""chat"" function. Although each bid or offer was communicated on a one-to-one basis, DMO staff determined some of these facilities satisfied the multiple-to- multiple prong because multiple market participants were able to initiate a one-to-one communication and the participant could choose to send the communication to one or more market participants. Thus, the platforms enabled multiple market participants to accept bids and offers from multiple market participants. The determining factor of the multiple-to- multiple prong depends not on whether communications are bilateral or multilateral, but instead on whether more than one participant has the ability to execute or trade swaps by accepting bids and offers from more than one participant.12 Thus, a facility may satisfy the multiple-to-multiple prong even if (i) the facility permits only bilateral, or ""one-to-one,"" communications, and (ii) multiple participants cannot simultaneously request, make or accept bids and offers from multiple participants. Similarly, a facility may satisfy the multiple-to-multiple prong if the facility permits only ""one-to-many"" communications from which multiple participants can initiate a one-to-many communication. 2. Entities listing only swaps that are not subject to the trade execution requirement DMO staff reminds entities that registration may be required if they operate a facility that meets the SEF definition, even if the facility facilitates the trading and execution only of swaps not subject to the trade execution requirement.13 3. Facilities offering non-electronic methods of trading The SEF definition is not limited to a specific method of execution on the facility. Thus, facilities that meet the SEF definition and offer only non-electronic methods of trading may need to register as a SEF. As noted in the 2013 Final Rule, the Commission interpreted the phrase ""through any means of interstate commerce"" in the SEF definition in CEA section 1a(50) to mean the utilization of ""a variety of means of execution or communication, including, but not limited to, telephones, internet communications, and electronic transmissions.""14 12 If the multiple-to-multiple prong turned on whether participants were able to communicate with multiple liquidity providers simultaneously, facilities could limit communications to bilateral means in order to avoid the registration requirement. For example, a facility allowing a participant to press a button once to send a communication to multiple participants, instead could require the participant to press the button multiple times, once for each participant contacted. DMO staff believes the reasons for requiring SEF registration is identical in both situations, and does not believe Congress intended the Commission to disregard substance for form. 7 U.S.C. 1a(50) and 7b-3(a)(1);see also 2013 Final Rule at 33481 n.88. Id. at 33501 n.328. September 29, 2021 SEF Registration Advisory Page 4 4. Entities registered with the Commission in some other capacity An entity that is registered with the Commission in another capacity, such as a CTA or introducing broker (""IB""), may be subject to the SEF registration requirement if it operates a facility that falls within the SEF definition. CEA sections 1a(50) and 5h(a)(1) provide an exception to the SEF registration requirement to entities registered as DCMs; there is no exception for entities otherwise registered with the Commission.15 To this end, DMO staff advises existing CFTC registered entities, such as CTAs and IBs, to review carefully their activities and evaluate whether they may be subject to the SEF registration requirement. C. Conclusion Whether a particular facility is required to register depends on all of the relevant facts and circumstances of the facility's operations. DMO staff encourages entities falling within the categories discussed above to review their activities and assess whether they meet the SEF definition, thereby requiring SEF registration. DMO staff also encourages any person operating a facility for the trading or processing of swaps to reach out to DMO staff if they have questions about their activities and their potential obligation to register the facility as a SEF.16 This Advisory is intended to remind the affected parties of their obligations under the CEA and Commission regulations. The Advisory may include interpretations of the CEA and Commission regulations relating to whether an entity may be required to register as a SEF based on certain facts and circumstances. It is not intended to create any enforceable rights, any new binding registration rules or regulations, or to amend existing rules or regulations. This Advisory represents only the views of DMO staff and does not necessarily represent the views of the Commission or of any other division or office of the Commission. If you have any questions concerning this Advisory, please contact Nancy Markowitz, Deputy Director, Division of Market Oversight, at (202) 418-5453 or nmarkowitz@cftc.gov, or Jonathan Lave, Associate Director, Division of Market Oversight, at (202) 418-5983 or jlave@cftc.gov. Sincerely, _______________________ Dorothy Dewitt Director Division of Market Oversight 7 U.S.C. 1a(50) and 7b-3(a)(1). Thus, a DCM may list swaps and offer a platform for trading and executing swaps, but not have to register as a SEF. 17 CFR § 37.3. Such outreach, however, should not be construed as providing the facility with a de facto ""safe harbor"" from enforcement for past regulatory failures.

US Securities & Exchange Commission,A new ETF launched in Canada will allow investors to gain exposure to both bitcoin and ethereum,Business Insider | Clusterstock Posts,Business Insider,"A new ETF launched in Canada will allow investors to gain exposure to both bitcoin and ethereum  The market-cap weighted fund from Evolve ETFs currently has about 68% of its holdings in bitcoin and 32% in ether.  The Evolve Cryptocurrencies ETF is a market-cap weighted crypto fund that holds both bitcoin and ether. The fund currently has about 68% of its holdings in bitcoin and 32% in ether. Bitcoin and ether combined make up about 65% of the total cryptocurrency market.  The new ETF will be rebalanced monthly, does not utilize leverage, and will not pay distributions. It will gain exposure to bitcoin and ether by holding the Evolve Bitcoin ETF (EBIT) and the Evolve Ether ETF (ETHR). While there's no management fee, the underlying ETFs held in the fund do have a 0.75% management fee.  ""EBIT and ETHR provide investors with exposure to the daily price movements of the US dollar price of Bitcoin and Ether, respectively, by utilizing the benefits of the creation and redemption processes offered by the exchange traded fund structure,"" Evolve said in a press release.  The creation and redemption process is the underlying plumbing of ETFs that allow them to be more transparent, less costly, and more tax efficient than mutual funds.  In the first day of trades, the Evolve Cryptocurrencies ETF has amassed a paltry $2.1 million in assets. Evolve ETF's two other cryptocurrency funds have about $181 million in combined assets under management, according to the firm's website.  While Canada's crypto ETF market gets off its feet, US investors still have few options in gaining exposure to cryptocurrencies besides buying them outright, as SEC Chairman Gary Gensler continues to seek strict regulations for the crypto market."

We find violations with respect   to the failure of PG&E’s website, which was unavailable or non-functional   during significant portions of the PSPS event, inaccuracy of its online outage   maps, inaccessibility of its secure data transfer portals to its public safety   partners, and PG&E’s failure to provide advanced notification of de-energization   events to approximately 50,000 customers and 1,100 Medical Baseline customers   during the three PSPS events in Fall 2019.     The Commission finds that a penalty of $106.003 million is appropriate to   deter future violations and demand accountability for PG&E’s flawed   implementation of the Fall 2019 PSPS events.  The penalty will be offset by    $86 million based on the bill credits PG&E has already provided to some electric   customers in 2019.  Therefore, the net penalty assessed on PG&E is $20.003   million.     The penalty includes a PG&E shareholder contribution of $1.418 million to   the PG&E’s Disability Disaster Access & Resources Program, which provides   qualifying customers access to backup portable batteries through grant,    lease-to-own, or low-interest loan options.  The penalty also includes a PG&E   shareholder funded bill credit of $12.185 million extended to all electric   customers in the geographic areas affected by the Fall 2019 PSPS events.  Lastly,   the penalty includes a PG&E shareholder funded bill credit of $6.4 million to the   R.18-12-005 ALJ/MOD-POD/MPO/mph  - 3 -  Medical Baseline customers in the geographic areas affected by the Fall 2019   PSPS events.     Rulemaking 18-12-005 remains open.   1.  Background    On October 9, 2019, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E)   implemented a Public Safety Power Shutoff (PSPS) event across 35 counties,   impacting approximately 729,000 customer accounts.  The shutoff lasted until   October 12, 2019.  PG&E implemented additional PSPS events on    October 23-25, 2019, and October 26-November 1, 2019, which, at one point,   impacted 38 counties and approximately 975,000 customer accounts.  Many of   the affected customers were without power for nearly a week.     On October 18, 2019, the California Public Utilities Commission   (Commission) convened an emergency meeting regarding the October 9-12, 2019   PSPS event.  At the October 18, 2019 meeting, PG&E executives admitted to   significant shortcomings in the company’s execution of the October 9-12, 2019   PSPS event.  Subsequently, in its October 25, 2019, November 8, 2019, and   November 18, 2019 compliance reports regarding the October 9-12, 2019,    October 23-25, 2019, and October 26-November 1, 2019 PSPS events, PG&E   identified multiple areas where it failed to meet the requirements of Public   Utilities (Pub. Util.) Code Section 451, Resolution ESRB-8, and the Phase 1   Guidelines adopted in D.19-05-042 (D.19-05-042 Guidelines) with regards to   those PSPS events.    On November 12, 2019, the assigned Commissioner and assigned   Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) issued a ruling directing PG&E to show cause   why it should not be sanctioned by the Commission for violation of Pub. Util.   Code Section 451, D.19-05-042 Guidelines, and Resolution ESRB-8 during the   R.18-12-005 ALJ/MOD-POD/MPO/mph  - 4 -  PSPS events during October 9-12, 2019 and October 23-25, 2019, and    October 26-November 1, 2019 (Order to Show Cause or OSC).  A prehearing   conference (PHC) was held on December 4, 2019, to discuss the issues of law and   fact and determine the need for hearing and schedule for resolving the matter.     On December 23, 2019, the Commission issued the Assigned   Commissioner and Assigned ALJ’s Ruling Setting the Scope and Schedule of the   Order to Show Cause Against Pacific Gas and Electric Company for Violations   Related to the Implementation of the Public Safety Power Shutoffs in    October 2019 (December 23, 2019 Ruling).     PG&E served testimony on February 5, 2020.  The California Large Energy   Consumers Association (CLECA), Center for Accessible Technology (CforAT),   City of San Jos  e   (San Jos  e),   Joint Local Governments  1  ,   Mussey Grade Road   Alliance (MGRA), Small Business Utility Advocates (SBUA), and the Utility   Reform Network (TURN) served responsive testimony on February 28, 2020.    PG&E, the Commission’s Public Advocates Office (Cal Advocates), and the Joint   Local Governments served rebuttal testimony on April 7, 2020.   Status conferences were held on July 9, 2020 and August 27, 2020.  On   September 21, 2020, the Assigned Commissioner and Assigned ALJ issued a   ruling determining that evidentiary hearings would not be necessary contingent   on PG&E’s clarification of outstanding issues, and setting a briefing schedule.    PG&E served a document clarifying the outstanding issues identified in the   September 21, 2020 ruling on October 5, 2020.   On October 13, 2020, a joint motion to move exhibits into the record was   filed by PG&E, CLECA, CforAT, San Jos  e,   Joint Local Governments, MGRA,    1    The Joint Local Governments consist of the Counties of Kern, Marin, Mendocino, Napa,   Nevada, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara and Sonoma and the City of S"

There can be no assurance that we will increase the Maximum Tender Amount.  In addition to the applicable Exchange Consideration, Eligible Holders whose 2021 Notes are accepted for exchange in  the Exchange Offer will also receive accrued and unpaid interest in respect of such exchanged 2021 Notes from the last  interest payment date for the 2021 Notes (which was May 7, 2021) to, but not including, September 8, 2021 (such  payment, the ""Accrued Interest Payment""), to be paid in cash  (subject to any tax withholdings applicable to Argentine  Entity Offerees or to Non-Cooperating Jurisdictions Offerees) on the Settlement Date (as de~ned below).

This processing fee will be paid only with respect to individual tenders of a principal amount of U.S.$500,000 or  less and will be an amount equal to 0.25% of the principal amount of the tendered 2021 Notes in respect of which a  request for a processing fee is made and that are ultimately accepted for exchange.

For any 2021 Notes that have been validly tendered on or prior to the Expiration Date (other than any 2021 Notes that  have been accepted for exchange and settled on the Early Settlement Date) and that are accepted for exchange, we  expect to settle such 2021 Notes promptly following the Expiration Date (the ""Final Settlement Date""). Assuming that  such Final Settlement Date is not extended and all conditions of the Exchange Offer have been satis~ed or, where  applicable, waived by us, we expect that the Final Settlement Date will occur on or about October 19, 2021, which is the  third business day after the Expiration Date (as the same may be extended with respect to the Exchange Offer). We refer  to each of the Early Settlement Date and the Final Settlement Date as a ""Settlement Date.""  The Exchange Offer is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, set forth under the heading ""The Offer—The  Conditions"" of the Exchange Offer Memorandum. Subject to applicable law and limitations described in the Exchange  Offer Memorandum, we may waive any of these conditions in our sole discretion.    The purpose of the Exchange Offer is to provide Eligible Holders with the opportunity to remain invested in the  Company's notes by exchanging 2021 Notes for 2025 Notes and in turn increase the liquidity of the 2025 Notes. The 2021  Notes mature on November 7, 2021 at which time the Company fully expects to use cash on hand to repay any  outstanding 2021 Notes not tendered in the Exchange Offer and anticipates that it will have access to the Argentine  Foreign Exchange Market for such repayment in accordance with applicable regulations of the Argentine Central Bank.  If and when issued, the 2025 Notes will not be registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws. Therefore,  the 2025 Notes may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the  registration requirements of the Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws.  Global Bondholder Services Corporation will act as the Exchange and Information Agent for the Exchange Offer.

The Offer  Documents are available for Eligible Holders at the following web address: https://gbsc-usa.com/eligibility/cgc.  Subject to applicable law, the Exchange Offer may be amended in any respect, extended or, upon failure of a condition  to be satis~ed or waived prior to the Expiration Date or Settlement Date, as the case may be, terminated, at any time  and for any reason. Although we have no present plans or arrangements to do so, we reserve the right to amend, at any  time, the terms of the Exchange Offer (including, without limitation, the conditions thereto) in accordance with  applicable law. We will give Eligible Holders notice of any amendments and will extend the Expiration Date if required  by applicable law.  Eligible Holders are advised to check with any bank, securities broker or other intermediary through which they hold  2021 Notes as to when such intermediary would need to receive instructions from an Eligible Holder in order for that  Eligible Holder to be able to participate in, or withdraw their instruction to participate in, the Exchange Offer before the  deadlines speci~ed in the Offer Documents.

Home Mortgage Disclosure Act,Why sellers are shunning FHA and VA offers,Inman | Agent News,Inman,"Why sellers are shunning FHA and VA offers  FHA and VA loans are essential to first-time buyers, who account for about 4 out of every 5 FHA purchase loans. However, in today's market, sellers are quick to dismiss offers that come with this type of financing. Here's why  FHA and VA loans are essential to first-time buyers, who account for about four out of every five FHA purchase loans. However, in today’s market, sellers are quick to dismiss offers that come with this type of financing. Here’s why.  Qualified offers from buyers using FHA or VA financing don’t stand a chance in today’s seller’s market. That’s because two government policies meant to protect them from unsafe properties and exorbitant prices eliminate them from competitive sales as soon as their bids are opened.  To ensure that properties are not overvalued, FHA and VA loans require sellers to reduce the agreed-upon purchase price to match the appraised value within five percent — or the deal can’t proceed. Buyers using conventional loans have more flexibility to address low appraisals, but not those using FHA or VA.  Appraisers are also required to inspect properties and report threats to health, security or safety, such as the lack of safety handrails in open staircases, peeling or chipping paint, and windows or doors without locks.  Repairs must be made before the loan can close, or the lender can set up an escrow account for the repairs to be completed afterward.  “There has to be a property inspection for an FHA sale. With a conventional loan, a buyer and a seller can agree to purchase with no inspection. Still, FHA won’t allow that,” said Garth Rieman, director of Housing Advocacy and Strategic Initiatives for the National Council of State Housing Finance Agencies (NCSHA).  Agents play a critical role in the process. “In my experience, sellers’ perceptions are based on what they hear about FHA from their real estate agents,” Lisa DeBrock, Division Director, Homeownership for the Washington State Housing Finance Commission, told the Down Payment Report.  “For example, many agents think that FHA appraisals are more difficult than conventional ones. Any appraisal of an older home might raise concerns that need to be addressed for the home to qualify. Still, loan officers tell me that the cost to bring these properties up to par is usually minimal.”  An April survey of Realtors by the National Association of Realtors (NAR) found that 89 percent sellers would be likely to accept an offer from a buyer with a conventional loan. On the other hand, only 30 percent would be likely to accept an offer from a buyer using an FHA or VA loan, and 6 percent of sellers said they would not even consider an offer from an FHA or VA buyer.  According to a new analysis by two scholars at the Urban Institute, “Some 60 percent of Black and Latino homebuyers use FHA financing. Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data shows that flat-out rejection of buyers seeking government-backed loans disadvantaged households with lower incomes, lower credit scores, and less wealth, many of whom are people of color.”  “In a hot housing market, borrowers using FHA or VA mortgages are at a disadvantage to those using conventional mortgages. And the borrowers who disproportionately use these mortgages are the families of color who have historically been excluded from homeownership and could most benefit from today’s low-interest rates,” The Urban Institute’s Laurie Goodman and Janneke Ratcliffe wrote in a June 16 blog post.  “As a result, it is more difficult for these borrowers to compete for homes, which exacerbates the racial homeownership gap,” the article mentioned. Despite the boom in sales, that gap has been widening.  As Libertina Brandt reported in this June Inman article, “the homeownership rate among Black Americans in the first quarter of 2021 clocked in at 45.1 percent compared to 73.8 percent among white Americans, according to the results of a new survey released Wednesday by Redfin.”  “To whatever extent buyers are not considering FHA offers, it is affecting people of color because FHA is so valuable to them,” Rieman said. HUD Public Affairs did not provide a comment.  FHA and VA loans also are essential to first-time buyers, who account for about four out of every five FHA purchase loans. As the unpopularity of government-insured financing escalated during the spring and summer, first-time buyers’ share of sales fell from 35 percent in June 2020 to 30 percent a year later.  Closing times for both FHA and VA purchase loans have both increased by eight days over the past year as buyers using government-backed financing struggle to find a home.  The Urban Institute brief suggested that “the FHA and VA could more closely align their rules with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and HUD. The VA could consider either eliminating the home inspection or making it less prescriptive. HUD and the VA could consider making appraisal requirements more flexible, using the same rules currently applied to loans purchased by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.”  Steve Cook edits The Down Payment Report for Down Payment Resource and writes for leading real estate blogs and news outlets.

Freedom of Information Act,"Proposed Rule - Airworthiness Directives; Honda Aircraft Company, LLC Airplanes",Justia | The Federal Register | Recent Federal Regulation Documents,Justia,"Proposed Rule - Airworthiness Directives; Honda Aircraft Company, LLC Airplanes  The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Honda Aircraft Company, LLC (Honda) Model HA-420 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of in-flight smoke and fire that initiated from the windshield heat power wire braid. This proposed AD would require incorporating temporary revisions into the airplane flight manual (AFM) and the quick reference handbook (QRH) that modify procedures for windshield heat operation until the affected windshield assemblies are replaced.

The agency will also post a report summarizing each substantive verbal contact received about this NPRM. Confidential Business Information CBI is commercial or financial information that is both customarily and actually treated as private by its owner. Under the Freedom of Information Act E:\FR\FM\30SEP1.SGM 30SEP1 Federal Register / Vol. 86, No. 187 / Thursday, September 30, 2021 / Proposed Rules (FOIA) (5 U.S.C. 552), CBI is exempt from public disclosure. If your comments responsive to this NPRM contain commercial or financial information that is customarily treated as private, that you actually treat as private, and that is relevant or responsive to this NPRM, it is important that you clearly designate the submitted comments as CBI. Please mark each page of your submission containing CBI as ‘‘PROPIN.’’ The FAA will treat such marked submissions as confidential under the FOIA, and they will not be placed in the public docket of this NPRM. Submissions containing CBI should be sent to Bryan Long, Aviation Safety Engineer, Atlanta ACO Branch, FAA, 1701 Columbia Avenue, College Park, GA 30337. Any commentary that the FAA receives that is not specifically designated as CBI will be placed in the public docket for this rulemaking. Background The FAA received a report of inflight smoke and fire that initiated from the windshield heat power wire braid on a Honda Model HA–420 airplane. An investigation identified that certain Honda Model HA–420 airplanes could have a severed windshield heat power wire braid from installation of the windshield heat wiring during manufacture. The severed windshield heat power wire braid could cause arcing that ignites the wire sheathing and sealant and the windshield acrylic. This condition, if not addressed, could lead to cockpit smoke and fire. FAA’s Determination The FAA is issuing this NPRM after determining that the unsafe condition described previously is likely to exist or develop on other products of the same type design. Related Service Information Under 1 CFR Part 51 The FAA reviewed the following temporary revisions. • Honda Aircraft Company Temporary Revision TR 04A–1, dated March 4, 2020, for Airplane Flight Manual HJI–29001–003–001 Rev C. • HondaJet Temporary Revision TR 04A–1, dated March 4, 2020, for Quick Reference Handbook HJ1–29000–007– 001 Rev C. • Honda Aircraft Company Temporary Revision TR 04A–1, dated March 4, 2020, for Airplane Flight Manual HJ1–29001–003–001 Rev E. • HondaJet Temporary Revision TR 04A–1, dated March 4, 2020, for Quick Reference Handbook Normal Procedures Rev E, HJ1–29001–007–001. These temporary revisions provide modified procedures for windshield heat operation to reduce exposure to potential windshield heat for the applicable serial numbers specified on the documents. The FAA also reviewed Honda Service Bulletin SB–420–56–002, Revision B, dated April 19, 2021 (Honda SB–420–002B). The service bulletin specifies identifying and replacing affected windshield assemblies. The service bulletin also specifies removing the temporary revisions to the AFM, QRH, and electronic checklist (ECL) after the affected windshield assemblies have been replaced. This service information is reasonably available because the interested parties have access to it through their normal course of business or by the means identified in the ADDRESSES section. Proposed AD Requirements in This NPRM This proposed AD would require incorporating the temporary revisions to 54127 the AFM and QRH that modify procedures for windshield heat operations until the affected windshield assemblies are replaced. This proposal would allow the owner/operator (pilot) to revise the AFM and QRH. These revisions are not considered maintenance actions and may be done by a pilot holding at least a private pilot certificate. These actions must be recorded in the aircraft maintenance records to show compliance with this AD. Differences Between This AD and the Service Information Honda issued temporary revisions to the AFM, QRH, and ECL prior to issuing Honda SB–420–002B, which specifies replacement of the windshield assemblies. Honda SB–420–002B does not specify incorporating the temporary revisions to the AFM, QRH, and ECL but addresses removal if the temporary revisions were incorporated. The proposed AD would not require incorporating or removing the temporary revisions to the ECL because the ECL is not part of the approved type design of the airplane. All pertinent requirements would be addressed through the AFM. Costs of Compliance The FAA estimates that this AD, if adopted as proposed, would affect 156 airplanes of U.S. registry. There are 475 affected windshield assemblies worldwide, and the FAA has no way of knowing the number of affected windshield assemblies installed on U.S. airplanes. The estimated cost on U.S. operators reflects the maximum possible cost based on the 156 airplanes of U.S. registry. The FAA estimates the following costs to comply with this proposed AD: LOTTER on DSK11XQN23PROD with PROPOSALS1 ESTIMATED COSTS Cost per product Cost on U.S. operators Action Labor cost Parts cost Insert revised procedures in the AFM and QRH. * Windshield assembly replacement (both left and right assemblies). Remove revised procedures from the AFM and QRH. 1 work-hour × $85 per hour = $85 ............... Not applicable ... $85 $13,260 154 work-hours × $85 per hour = $13,090 .. $153,286 .......... 166,376 25,954,656 1 work-hour × $85 per hour = $85 ............... Not applicable .. 85 13,260 * On most airplanes, both the left and right windshield assemblies have a serial number affected by the unsafe condition, and the above costs represents replacement of both the left and right windshield assemblies. However, some airplanes may only have one affected windshield assembly and not require replacement of both. Authority for This Rulemaking Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA’s authority to issue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, section 106, describes the authority of VerDate Sep<11>2014 17:59 Sep 29, 2021 Jkt 253001 the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII: Aviation Programs, describes in more detail the scope of the Agency’s authority. PO 00000 Frm 00004 Fmt 4702 Sfmt 4702 The FAA is proposing this rulemaking under the authority described in Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701: General requirements. Under that section, Congress charges the FAA E:\FR\FM\30SEP1.SGM 30SEP1 54128 Federal Register / Vol. 86, No. 187 / Thursday, September 30, 2021 / Proposed Rules with promoting safe flight of civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for practices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary for safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that authority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to exist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action. Regulatory Findings The FAA determined that this proposed AD would not have federalism implications under Executive Order 13132. This proposed AD would not have a substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. For the reasons discussed above, I certify this proposed regulation: (1) Is not a ‘‘significant regulatory action’’ under Executive Order 12866, (2) Would not affect intrastate aviation in Alaska, and (3) Would not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Incorporation by reference, Safety. The Proposed Amendment Accordingly, under the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the FAA proposes to amend 14 CFR part 39 as follows: PART 39—AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1.

Home Mortgage Disclosure Act,Why sellers are shunning FHA and VA offers,Inman | Today's News,Inman,"Why sellers are shunning FHA and VA offers  FHA and VA loans are essential to first-time buyers, who account for about four out of every five FHA purchase loans. However, in today's market, sellers are quick to dismiss offers that come with this type of financing. Here's why.  FHA and VA loans are essential to first-time buyers, who account for about 4 out of every 5 FHA purchase loans. However, in today's market, sellers are quick to dismiss offers that come with this type of financing. Here's why  FHA and VA loans are essential to first-time buyers, who account for about four out of every five FHA purchase loans. However, in today’s market, sellers are quick to dismiss offers that come with this type of financing. Here’s why.  Qualified offers from buyers using FHA or VA financing don’t stand a chance in today’s seller’s market. That’s because two government policies meant to protect them from unsafe properties and exorbitant prices eliminate them from competitive sales as soon as their bids are opened.  To ensure that properties are not overvalued, FHA and VA loans require sellers to reduce the agreed-upon purchase price to match the appraised value within five percent — or the deal can’t proceed. Buyers using conventional loans have more flexibility to address low appraisals, but not those using FHA or VA.  Appraisers are also required to inspect properties and report threats to health, security or safety, such as the lack of safety handrails in open staircases, peeling or chipping paint, and windows or doors without locks.  Repairs must be made before the loan can close, or the lender can set up an escrow account for the repairs to be completed afterward.  “There has to be a property inspection for an FHA sale. With a conventional loan, a buyer and a seller can agree to purchase with no inspection. Still, FHA won’t allow that,” said Garth Rieman, director of Housing Advocacy and Strategic Initiatives for the National Council of State Housing Finance Agencies (NCSHA).  Agents play a critical role in the process. “In my experience, sellers’ perceptions are based on what they hear about FHA from their real estate agents,” Lisa DeBrock, Division Director, Homeownership for the Washington State Housing Finance Commission, told the Down Payment Report.  “For example, many agents think that FHA appraisals are more difficult than conventional ones. Any appraisal of an older home might raise concerns that need to be addressed for the home to qualify. Still, loan officers tell me that the cost to bring these properties up to par is usually minimal.”  An April survey of Realtors by the National Association of Realtors (NAR) found that 89 percent sellers would be likely to accept an offer from a buyer with a conventional loan. On the other hand, only 30 percent would be likely to accept an offer from a buyer using an FHA or VA loan, and 6 percent of sellers said they would not even consider an offer from an FHA or VA buyer.  According to a new analysis by two scholars at the Urban Institute, “Some 60 percent of Black and Latino homebuyers use FHA financing. Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data shows that flat-out rejection of buyers seeking government-backed loans disadvantaged households with lower incomes, lower credit scores, and less wealth, many of whom are people of color.”  “In a hot housing market, borrowers using FHA or VA mortgages are at a disadvantage to those using conventional mortgages. And the borrowers who disproportionately use these mortgages are the families of color who have historically been excluded from homeownership and could most benefit from today’s low-interest rates,” The Urban Institute’s Laurie Goodman and Janneke Ratcliffe wrote in a June 16 blog post.  “As a result, it is more difficult for these borrowers to compete for homes, which exacerbates the racial homeownership gap,” the article mentioned. Despite the boom in sales, that gap has been widening.  As Libertina Brandt reported in this June Inman article, “the homeownership rate among Black Americans in the first quarter of 2021 clocked in at 45.1 percent compared to 73.8 percent among white Americans, according to the results of a new survey released Wednesday by Redfin.”  “To whatever extent buyers are not considering FHA offers, it is affecting people of color because FHA is so valuable to them,” Rieman said. HUD Public Affairs did not provide a comment.  FHA and VA loans also are essential to first-time buyers, who account for about four out of every five FHA purchase loans. As the unpopularity of government-insured financing escalated during the spring and summer, first-time buyers’ share of sales fell from 35 percent in June 2020 to 30 percent a year later.  Closing times for both FHA and VA purchase loans have both increased by eight days over the past year as buyers using government-backed financing struggle to find a home.  The Urban Institute brief suggested that “the FHA and VA could more closely align their rules with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and HUD. The VA could consider either eliminating the home inspection or making it less prescriptive. HUD and the VA could consider making appraisal requirements more flexible, using the same rules currently applied to loans purchased by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.”  Steve Cook edits The Down Payment Report for Down Payment Resource and writes for leading real estate blogs and news outlets. He has been vice president of public affairs at the National Association of Realtors, a broadcast news correspondent, Congressional press secretary, and top executive for an international public relations firm."
LIMRA,Moving From Complex to Manageable: Implementing Absence Legislation,FINEOS | In The News,FINEOS,"Moving From Complex to Manageable: Implementing Absence Legislation  Thursday, September 30th, 2021 at 12:48 am. Original article appeared in LIMRA MarketFacts: Your Resource for Industry Insights July 2021 The transformation of ...  Original article appeared in LIMRA MarketFacts: Your Resource for Industry Insights July 2021  The transformation of an idea for new legislation into an actual law can be a winding road, full of compromise. With leave-of-absence laws, the legislator and regulator architect these colorful and sometimes unique programs. Elected legislators are responsible for hatching ideas and transforming them into laws. Regulators must work within the confines of the law to provide details about how to implement the law’s intentions.  For many larger legislative initiatives, such as the new wave of Paid Family and Medical Leave programs, passing the law is just the first phase. The regulatory process follows, defining how the law will play out. Most large legislative initiatives authorize an agency to create regulations that will dictate the details, such as benefit calculations, payment timing, deadlines, and definitions.  Often when legislation is passed, the remnants of compromise and discussion that occurred during the legislative process yield interesting results. For example, the breadth of family member relationships or age (for family leave), the allowable timing of leave, or the type of leave permitted (e.g., for a “school activity” leave, permitting leave for a disciplinary meeting but not an assembly).  Legislatures are diverse groups. The NCSL in its most recent 2015 study found that the top state legislators’ occupations (when they are not legislating) are law, business, professional legislator, agriculture, and education. Conspicuously absent from this list are HR professional and absence software provider. Once the leave law is on the road to regulatory implementation, often it is left to the HR department to handle. When legislators craft bills, they may not fully envision the homework they are creating for HR professionals who now must validate multiple questions impacting more than one law that might apply to an employee’s leave. While a single instance of this type of inquiry may seem manageable, employers with a multi-state employee population will quickly become overwhelmed. Sometimes the effective date for new legislation will be sufficient to allow HR managers time to get familiar and compliant with the change, while others (such as with recent COVID changes) require a quick, almost instantaneous compliance.  The humble spreadsheet is the Holy Grail of HR professionals. It can capture and hold infinite information about an employee’s leave of absence history. It is certainly a step above pen and paper. But, as the complexity and number of leave laws grows, the ability of HR managers to manage this has waned. To ensure compliance and an expected level of customer service at what is often a very difficult time for the employee needing leave, HR managers must be able to manage this complexity with smart computer software. Capturing the required information in software is essential and doing so in an efficient manner while simplifying the complexity for HR, employees, and supervisors is necessary for a positive user experience.  The benefits of leveraging software include automating the manual and mundane tasks, and crucially doing so for the complex and time-consuming tasks that are prone to human error. Moreover, automating leave administration provides consistency in employee treatment. Unlike a human, no matter how tired the system gets or how many cases it is trying to process in one day (like during a pandemic), the system can ensure reliability. To add convenience, employees can interact over multiple devices, and do not have to rely on a voice call or email.  Absence legislation is not getting simpler; and, if the pending legislation across the country is any indication, additional complexity is on the horizon. Adding technology tools to an employer’s toolkit can increase productivity, compliance, and experience.

Americans with Disabilities Act,"A Proclamation on National Disability Employment Awareness Month, 2021",The White House | Briefing Room,The White House,"A Proclamation on National Disability Employment Awareness Month, 2021  When we passed the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) 31 years ago, our Nation moved closer to fulfilling its foundational promise of liberty, justice, dignity, and equality for all. I was enormously proud to co-sponsor the ADA as a member of the United States Senate — a truly bipartisan effort that was personal to millions of families. For more than 60 million disabled Americans, the ADA is much more than just a law. It provides a vital source of opportunity and self-sufficiency, allows for increased economic participation, and serves as a powerful shield against discrimination in the workplace. National Disability Employment Awareness Month is a chance for us to celebrate workers with disabilities and recommit ourselves to dismantling barriers to access and inclusion in the workplace.  This year, the Office of Disability Employment Policy in the Department of Labor celebrates 20 years of helping advance opportunity for workers with disabilities across the Nation. As part of its mission, the agency remains at the forefront of emerging challenges in the workplace, such as developing comprehensive resources to ensure that workers grappling with the long-term effects of COVID-19 have access to the rights and resources they are due under disability law — including flexibilities, tools, and accommodations in the workplace.  Despite the progress our Nation has made in recent decades, people with disabilities are still too often marginalized and denied access to the American dream. Americans with disabilities — particularly women and people of color — have faced long-standing gaps in employment, advancement, and income. The COVID-19 pandemic has compounded these inequities, as people with disabilities have faced heightened risks — particularly the disproportionate share of people with disabilities employed in the hardest-hit industries. Our Nation will never fully recover and rebuild unless every single community — including disabled Americans — is fully included.  My Administration remains focused on ensuring that every single American has the chance to thrive, succeed, and contribute their talents. That is why I have issued Executive Orders to advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility to bolster career paths and promote economic stability for Americans with disabilities. I have proposed eliminating outdated, discriminatory provisions in the Fair Labor Standards Act that allow employers to pay disabled workers less than the minimum wage. Young people with disabilities in particular must be part of an inclusive economic recovery so that they can find the fulfilling careers, apprenticeships, and futures they deserve in every industry; to that end, we must promote the technologies and tools, as well as the attitudes, that foster welcoming work environments for young Americans. Our Nation’s future will be brighter and more secure when everyone is dealt into the economy we build together.  All Americans should be proud that we have made substantial progress since the days before the ADA — when an employer could refuse to hire you because of a disability, when a person using a wheelchair could not take a bus or a train to work, and when a person with a disability could be denied service in a restaurant or grocery store. Now, 31 years later, it is the shared responsibility of all of us to tear down the barriers that remain for people with disabilities and to ensure that all Americans have the chance to find good jobs and build good lives — for themselves and for the good of our entire Nation.  NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2021 as National Disability Employment Awareness Month. I urge all Americans to embrace the talents and skills that workers with disabilities bring to the national recovery and to promote the right to equal employment opportunity for all people.  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-sixth.  JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.  We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better."
Equal Credit Opportunity Act,Commercial lenders: Are you ready to start providing data on small business lending to the CFPB?,JD Supra | Elections & Politics Updates,JD Supra,"Commercial lenders: Are you ready to start providing data on small business lending to the CFPB?  Over the past year and a half, the CFPB has been quietly taking steps toward implementing regulations around collecting data from commercial lenders regarding commercial loans. Those efforts culminated on September 1, 2021, in a new rule proposed by the CFPB to start collecting application-level data regarding loans made to small businesses. Are commercial lenders ready?  What is Section 1071?  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank), which was passed more than a decade ago, contains Section 1071 (codified as 15 USC § 1691c-2 within the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA)). Section 1071 requires the CFPB to prescribe rules and guidance to “enable communities, governmental entities, and creditors to identify business and community development needs and opportunities of women-owned, minority-owned, and small businesses.”  It may surprise some lenders that the CFPB – the federal consumer financial protection agency – is in a position to regulate commercial entities, but it is. The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) is a federal law that has been around since the mid-1970s. It was enacted to ensure equal access to credit and to safeguard that financial institutions were not discriminating based on protected characteristics (for example, age, sex, or race). Most of the ECOA focuses on access to consumer credit, though there are several provisions that address commercial credit as well.  For many years after the passage of Dodd-Frank, the CFPB did not promulgate rules and regulations under Section 1071 – despite a clear mandate from Congress to do so. In 2019, the California Reinvestment Coalition took the unusual step of suing the CFPB in order to have a court enforce the Section 1071 mandate. The California Reinvestment Coalition and the CFPB reached a settlement in February 2020 in which the CFPB pledged to issue proposed rules.  In short, Section 1071 introduces a new regulatory burden on financial institutions, including exclusively commercial lenders: Section 1071 will require all financial institutions to collect and maintain data on how many borrowers apply for credit that are women-owned, minority-owned, or small businesses, and will require those financial institutions to report the data to the CFPB once a year.  If the CFPB’s proposed rule is finalized, the CFPB will add a new Subpart B to Regulation B to implement Section 1071’s mandate.  What is the CFPB going to collect from commercial lenders?  The CFPB is proposing to collect the following data from lenders:  The amount and type of small business credit applied for and extended;  Decisions made on certain small business credit applications;  Demographic information about small business credit applicants; and  Key elements of the price of the credit offered, such as information regarding interest rate, total origination charges, broker fees, initial annual charges, additional cost for merchant cash advances or other sales-based financing, and prepayment penalties.  Where are we in the rulemaking process?  The CFPB issued its notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) on September 1, 2021.  It is encouraging all stakeholders to review the NPR and provide comments to the CFPB in the 90-day window that will open as soon as the NPR is published in the Federal Register. In all likelihood, that means stakeholders – including commercial lenders of all sizes – will have through mid-December 2021 to provide comments to the CFPB. The CFPB will have to review the commentary before deciding whether to finalize the rule as proposed. The effective date of the rule, if it is finalized, will come after that. So mandatory compliance with the new Section 1071 rule is at least a year in the future.  What is the CFPB’s “Tell Your Story” portal?  In a twist on the traditional rulemaking process, the CFPB is soliciting both commentary from industry stakeholders as well as direct feedback from small business owners. Also on September 1, the CFPB launched its new small business landing page which includes a “Tell Your Story” portal – a place for small business owners to upload a narrative regarding their lending experiences. Although the portal is not explicitly a place for lodging complaints, like the CFPB’s already-existing consumer complaint portal, the Tell Your Story form includes a field for identifying the lender at issue in the business owner’s narrative.  Our Financial Services and Cybersecurity teams will continue to keep you posted on new developments."
Commodity Exchange Act,Class action lawsuit against beef processors proceeds,Western Farm Press | Press,Western Farm Press,"Jacqui Fatka  Class action lawsuit against beef processors proceeds  Cattle antitrust case will now proceed to discovery so that plaintiffs may test their claims.  A federal judge in Minnesota ordered a class action lawsuit against JBS, Tyson, National Beef and Cargill to proceed. In the ruling, Judge John R. Tunheim found that plaintiffs have plausibly plead that defendants conspired to suppress the price of fed cattle and increase the price of beef.  “We are pleased the effort to restore pricing transparency and competitiveness to the cattle markets is moving forward in the courtroom. This case is nearly two-and-a-half years old, and we look forward to the next step in the litigation,” comments Rob Larew, National Farmers Union president, which is a plaintiff in the case.  The case now enters the discovery phase of the trial, where evidence and information will be presented to demonstrate how packers violated the Sherman Antitrust Act, the Packers and Stockyards Act and the Commodity Exchange Act.  The class-action antitrust lawsuit was originally filed in April 2019 by R-CALF USA though its counsels Scott+Scott Attorneys at Law LLP, along with Cafferty Clobes Meriwether & Sprengel LLP.  USA’s antitrust action alleges the four processors violated the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 by engaging in a price-fixing conspiracy. It also alleges the entities violated the Packers and Stockyards Act as well as the Commodity Exchange Act.  “As the case moves to discovery, NFU will continue to hold the packers accountable. Malfeasance in the cattle markets has been very damaging to independent farmers and ranchers, and we look forward to continuing to advocate for our members in the courtroom,” Larew adds.  A public version of the order will be available at a later date, according to plaintiffs.  Separate DOJ investigation  On May 22, 2020, the DOJ’s Antitrust Division sent civil investigative demands to the nation’s four biggest meatpackers. Since that time, the American people have seen no public results from the investigation. In fact, there is no information to even suggest whether the investigation has concluded or is still ongoing, the letter notes.  Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D. previously reported that Congress has not received any update from the Department of Justice on its own investigation into the cattle price changes. He says this is not “unusual” as “agencies are notoriously tight-lipped about ongoing investigations, and there are legal reasons for that.”  However, he did note that the joint statement from leading cattle groups out of a Phoenix meeting in May confirmed their joint desire for a final report from DOJ. At the producer-led meeting, four member leaders from each the American Farm Bureau Federation, National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, National Farmers Union, R-CALF USA and the United States Cattlemen’s Association established several action items including demanding DOJ issue an update on its investigation into packer activity.  Related: Livestock groups unite on need to address cattle markets  Johnsons says it’s important to make sure these investigations get run to the ground and that the DOJ investigation is “for real, rather than just investigations for show.”  “I think there is a strong bipartisan coalition on the fact that these investigations really do need to conclude, and then we need to have a very transparent release of their findings.”  Following the meeting, Johnson and Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., led a bicameral letter to U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland urging the Department of Justice to move forward with their investigation into anticompetitive practices in the meatpacking industry.  caption text  Shutterstock  "

This paper reviews the main indicators developed for this   purpose by the Banco de España and by other central banks and prudential authorities.   In  this  way,  this  stocktaking  exercise  contributes  to  improving  the  transparency  and   effective communication of the financial stability-related tasks carried out at the Banco de   España. Some of the indicators are used in regular Banco de España surveillance activities,   whereas  others  pertain  to  specific  research  activities.  We  classify  our  set  of  measures   into  two  broad  categories  depending  on  the  risk  monitored:  standard  or  systemic  risks.   Given the multidimensional nature of systemic risk, its identification goes beyond the sum   of the standard risks explored in this paper (namely credit, macroeconomic, market, and   liquidity and bank risks). This survey also classifies indicators by the type of institutional   segment  that  triggers  risks;  namely,  sovereigns,  households,  non-financial  corporations,   banks, non-bank financial sector, residential real estate and the financial markets. This work   shows  how  the  measures  developed  and  regularly  used  at  the  Banco  de  España  allow   potential  vulnerabilities  to  be  comprehensively  monitored.  Nevertheless,  maintaining  an   adequate risk-identification framework requires continuous adaptation to new theoretical   developments and econometric tools, and, more importantly, to emerging challenges. In   this  respect,  there  is  a  current  drive  to  develop  new  indicators  to  assess  potential  risks   arising from climate change and those linked to the risk of system-wide cyber incidents. It is   expected that the monitoring needs related to these risks will increase in the future.

Resumen  Para los bancos centrales son cruciales el desarrollo y el mantenimiento de un marco de   identificación de riesgos que permita la detección temprana de posibles amenazas para   la estabilidad financiera y que facilite la aplicación de las políticas más adecuadas. Este   documento  resume  los  principales  indicadores  desarrollados  para  la  identificación  de   riesgos tanto por parte del Banco de España como por otros bancos centrales y autoridades   prudenciales. Así, esta recopilación de indicadores contribuye a mejorar la transparencia y   la comunicación del Banco de España en su objetivo de potenciar la estabilidad del sistema   financiero. El Banco de España utiliza algunos de estos indicadores en sus tareas regulares   de identificación y seguimiento de riesgos, mientras que otros proceden de trabajos de   investigación  concretos.  Este  conjunto  de  medidas  puede  clasificarse  en  dos  amplias   categorías,  en  función  del  tipo  de  riesgo  monitorizado:  estándar  o  sistémico.  Dada  la   naturaleza multidimensional del riesgo sistémico, su identificación va más allá de la propia   suma  de  los  riesgos  estándar  presentados  en  este  documento  (concretamente,  riesgos   de crédito, macroeconómico, de mercado, de liquidez y bancario). Este estudio también   clasifica los indicadores en función del tipo de segmento institucional donde se originan   los riesgos; concretamente, sector público, hogares, sociedades no financieras, bancos,   sector financiero no bancario, mercado inmobiliario residencial y mercados financieros. Este   trabajo muestra que los indicadores desarrollados y utilizados habitualmente por el Banco   de España permiten una monitorización exhaustiva de las vulnerabilidades potenciales. En   cualquier caso, el mantenimiento de un sistema de identificación de riesgos requiere una   adaptación continua a los nuevos desarrollos teóricos y herramientas econométricas, así   como a los nuevos desafíos. En este sentido, actualmente se están desarrollando nuevos   indicadores para evaluar los riesgos derivados del cambio climático y los relacionados con   los ciberriesgos. Se espera que las necesidades de seguimiento relacionadas con estos   riesgos aumenten en el futuro.

While the monetary   policy function of central banks has been discussed extensively in the literature, their financial   stability  role  has  gained  attention  more  recently,  especially  in  the  aftermath  of  the  Great   Financial Crisis (GFC). Thus, over the last decade central banks and prudential authorities   have  acquired  greater  responsibilities  to  preserve  financial  stability  through  the  adoption   of  macroprudential  policy  frameworks.  The  objective  of  this  new  role  is  to  strengthen   financial  stability  by  mitigating  the  risks  stemming  from  macro-financial  imbalances  and   the  destabilising  interactions  across  financial  institutions  and  markets  (Restoy,  2020).  1  Thus, central banks currently approach risks to financial stability from two complementary   perspectives with the potential to interact: either entity by entity, in the case of the traditional   microprudential  approach,  or  system-wide  for  this  new  macroprudential  approximation.   However,  despite  the  significant  progress  in  this  area,  a  full  analytical  framework  with   well-defined and quantifiable indicators for its correct functioning has yet to be developed   (Mencía and Saurina, 2016). In particular, there is still no widespread consensus on which   risk indicators should be used. Among other factors, this limitation of current identification   frameworks is a result of the diffuse nature of financial stability objectives, which hinders   risk identification, and the fact that macroprudential policy is still in its infancy. Besides,   assessment of the stability of the financial system as a whole is complex as it involves the   continuous monitoring and analysis of a wide range of potential risks and vulnerabilities that   may threaten it.   The development of an appropriate and transparent risk identification framework is   crucial for at least two reasons. First, as shown in Figure 1, accurate risk identification is a   prerequisite for achieving the final goal of financial stability. An adequate set of identification   tools  promotes  an  early  and  better-informed  detection  of  potential  threats  and  helps  to   address  them  by  taking  appropriate  policy  actions.  Second,  a  proper  communication  of   an adequate risk identification approach helps to increase the transparency of the financial   stability function, which can itself contribute to reducing uncertainty (Oosterloo and de Haan,   2004) and to stakeholders adopting mitigating actions.  The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the main indicators used by the   Banco de España to identify risks and vulnerabilities. Some of these measures are part of the   regular surveillance work carried out by the Banco de España, whereas other indicators are   the result of specific research activities. This survey allows the risk identification toolkit used   at the Banco de España to be compared with that of other institutions, identifying potential   gaps that may merit further work. However, a huge variety of diverse and heterogeneous   1     In the case of Spain, Law 10/2014 on the regulation, supervision and solvency of credit institutions designates the   Banco de España as the sectoral authority in charge of macroprudential policy to address systemic risks that pose   a threat to the stability of the banking system. Besides, the Spanish Macroprudential Authority (AMCESFI) has the   mandate to regularly monitor and analyse the sources of systemic risk. AMCESFI is headed by the Ministry of Economic   Affairs  and  Digital  Transformation  with  the  participation  of  senior  officials  from  this  Ministry  and  from  the  Banco  de   España, the CNMV (Spanish National Securities Market Commission) and the DGSFP (Directorate General of Insurance   and Pension Funds).  BANCO DE ESPAÑA   10   DOCUMENTO OCASIONAL N.º 2125  indicators  have  been  designed  for  risk  identification,  which  illustrates  the  complexity  of   this type of analysis. Besides, the number of identification tools is constantly increasing,   as a result of the development of new econometric methodologies and the incorporation   of the experience of new crises. In fact, in the aftermath of the GFC, considerable attention   has been devoted to the measurement of systemic risks and, in parallel, the literature has   proposed a plethora of alternative risk metrics (see Bisias et al., 2012 and Hattori et al., 2014   for some surveys).   This  abundance  of  indicators  in  the  literature  prevents  us  from  attempting  a   comprehensive  overview.  Therefore,  this  survey  contains  a  non-exhaustive  summary  of   the main indicators developed and used by the Banco de España, and by other selected   institutions. The different measures have been chosen in light of their relevance or their novel   approach. They range from purely data-driven indicators to some identification instruments   that require more complex models.   As  reported  in  Figure  1,  indicators  may  be  broadly  classified  into  two  groups   depending on the nature of the risks they aim to capture: standard risks and systemic risk.   First, we focus on five standard risk categories, namely: (1) credit risk, (2) macroeconomic risk,   (3) market risk, (4) funding and liquidity risks, and (5) risks related to banks’ profitability and   solvency. Our approach to classifying these categories draws on standard taxonomies of risk   identification indicators (broadly used by central banks and other relevant institutions) such   as that followed in the ESRB risk dashboard.  2   Besides, we also examine different measures   to analyse these standard risks across different segments (sovereigns, households, non-  financial corporations, banks, non-bank financial sector, residential real estate (RRE) and   financial markets). Second, we review systemic risk indicators, which are linked to threats   2     The ESRB risk dashboard is a non-exhaustive list of both quantitative and qualitative indicators to measure systemic risk   https://www.esrb.europa.eu/pub/rd/html/index.en.html.

Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act,FACTA realiza Simpósio Internacional de Coccidiose,Feed & Food | Notícias,Feed & Food,"FACTA realiza Simpósio Internacional de Coccidiose  A fim de se debater sobre coccidiose, Fundação APINCO de Ciência e Tecnologia Avícolas (FACTA) realizará simpósio. Iniciativa on-line tem data marcada para o dia 7 de outubro, das 8h30 às 17h45. Inscrições ainda podem ser realizadas.  Como destaca o presidente da FACTA, Ariel Mendes, o número de inscritos já atingiu a expectativa da entidade, o que reforça a importância da pauta no setor avícola. “Estimativas recentes apontam que as perdas anuais são equivalentes a cerca de U$$ 14.8 bilhões para a produção mundial. De posse desses números, percebemos que a atualização e a troca de experiências se fazem necessárias para manter a pujança do setor”.  Para a programação, evento contará com temas como “A Coccidiose Aviaria – recalculando…”, com Damer Blake, do The Royal Veterinary College e “O papel do intestino na resposta imuno contra as coccidias”, proferida por Luiz Felipe Caron, da Universidade Federal do Paraná (UFPR/IMUNOVA).  No painel “Estratégia de controle de Coccidiose / Controle e monitoramento para Aves de ciclo longo”, nomes como Ricardo Rauber, da BRF e Cristiane Cantelli, do Grupo Mantiqueira, apresentam suas soluções para o tema.  Já no painel internacional, que falará sobre a “Frango de corte”, uma visão geral sobre o panorama da realidade avícola brasileira será apresentada por Márcio Reolon, da Coasul, por Elizabeth Dale, da Pilgrim’s, que trará os acontecimentos do setor nos Estados Unidos e Maarten De Gussem, médico-veterinário pela Faculdade de Medicina Veterinária da Universidade de Ghent, nos EUA, que falará sobre a União Europeia.  Para Mendes, reunir nomes de peso no evento demonstra a preocupação da FACTA em manter a avicultura industrial sempre à frente do seu tempo. “Encontros como este trazem novidades essenciais para o setor, que precisa estar atento a todo processo de produção, principalmente no que se refere a sanidade do plantel para obtenção de bons resultados”, afirma.

Employee Retirement Income Security Act,"PANC 2021: Tax Rates, RMDs and Retirement Income Planning",PLANADVISER | Latest News,PLANADVISER,"Rebecca Moore  PANC 2021: Tax Rates, RMDs and Retirement Income Planning  Just as retirement savers use investment diversification for accumulating assets, they need tax diversification for retirement income planning.  Speaking at the virtual 2021 PLANADVISER National Conference (PANC), Keith Gredys, chairman and CEO of Kidder Advisers Inc., said that although there are dividing lines in financial planning because every adviser has his own expertise, tax planning needs to be factored into financial planning. “A person can have the most efficient financial plan but it might not be the most effective for reaching their goals if it doesn’t include tax planning,” he said.  Dave Alison, chief operating officer (COO) and founding partner at C2P Enterprises, said consumers expect to receive financial advice separate from tax advice, but his company earns new business these days by offering customers one place to get all aspects of financial planning. Alison contended that advisers are not meeting the best interest standard if they are not at least coordinating with other professionals for holistic financial advice. “Tax planning and financial planning is pairing good, modern nutrition to get an optimal outcome,” he said.  Keith Huber, investment adviser, retirement services, with Fiduciary Plan Advisors, a OneDigital company, said if there is a fence that divides good financial advice and tax planning, it needs to be torn down.  When talking about tax-efficient investing to a client, advisers should explain not just how he should allocate his retirement savings, but what vehicles to invest in, including Roth and pre-tax, Huber said.  “We need tax diversification. We have to prepare for inevitable changes and prepare for unknowns,” Huber said. “We know what taxes are going to be in the next several years, but clients need different vehicles to be prepared for age 65 and beyond.”  Michael Webb, senior financial adviser at CAPTRUST and the panel’s moderator, said, “If someone has all their savings in pre-tax accounts, they’re making a bet, and if everything is in Roth accounts, they’re making a bet. Account diversification is hedging bets.”  Gredys suggested that retirement savers need to build a plan that is flexible because they don’t know what the future holds. “Tax planning is a different form of diversification,” he said. “Everyone will have their own design based on what they want to be done.”  Tax planning is complex because there is no one-size-fits-all solution, Alison noted. When deciding whether to save in a Roth account or a pre-tax account, clients should consider their goals for future generations, among other factors, he added.  Alison said the conversation about Roth versus pre-tax centers not on a client’s tax bracket, but on their marginal tax rate. As an example, he said a married client filing jointly currently could have $81,000 in taxable income before they move from a 12% to a 22% tax bracket. Roth creates an opportunity because if that couple has $70,000 in taxable income, they have $11,000 in taxable income to go before they move into a higher tax bracket. Alison said it makes sense to take the $11,000 and pay 12% in taxes today before moving into a higher tax bracket.  Alison added that another time when “Roth shines” is when thinking about taxes on a spousal beneficiary.  “People don’t understand how taxes go up on the spouse of a deceased person; taxes go up exponentially,” he said. “Having savings in a Roth is incredibly helpful in that situation. We can also think about whether children or grandchildren are in a higher or lower tax bracket than the client. That’s where an adviser helps; when thinking of the client’s long-term goals and objectives.”  When considering Roth conversions for clients, Alison said the best time to pay taxes is when they are low, and right now taxes are low with government debt rising, so they will probably increase in the future. He said it might not make sense to convert all savings to a Roth account, but it might make sense to convert some.  “If the client’s capacity is for a 22% or 24% tax bracket, it makes sense to convert some savings to a Roth account, but unless they are going to be in a high tax bracket for rest of their life, they shouldn’t covert all,” he explained.  Considerations for RMDs  Retirement income planning must also take into consideration required minimum distributions (RMDs), the panel experts agreed. Webb noted that the RMD age has increased from 70.5 to 72 and is confusing to many people. Meanwhile, legislation has been introduced to move it gradually to age 75.  Alison said he thinks RMDs should go away. “The reality is that most people don’t save enough for retirement and will need distributions,” he said.  However, when helping clients with RMD planning, Alison suggested advisers determine which account they’ll draw from. “We suggest clients never take RMDs out of growth accounts because we want to lower sequence of return risk,” he explained.  Huber said many people don’t do financial planning because they don’t realize what they don’t know, and he is in favor of forced RMDs for this reason. “People miss RMDs because they aren’t aware of the rules,” he said. “Advisers can turn on this service for individual and plan sponsor clients.”  Gredys noted that retirement plan participants may have money in individual retirement accounts (IRAs) as well as more traditional retirement plans, so advisers can help them pull everything together. He added that stretch IRAs are no longer allowed, so some people will need help with estate planning. Advisers can help them check whether the language in their wills and trusts complies with the new rules.  The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, has issued a ruling in a consolidated Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) lawsuit filed against Allstate.  The ruling comes in response to two originally separate complaints filed against Allstate, both alleging various breaches of fiduciary duties and prohibited transactions in the provision of retirement plan investments to its own employees. Though none of the companies are named as defendants, the complaints also included allegations involving the actions of Northern Trust, Financial Engines and Alight Financial Advisors.  The first complaint was filed in November, and the second complaint was filed in January. Given the substantial similarities in the lawsuits, the court combined the complaints and has now ruled on them collectively. The order rejects the defense’s motions to dismiss the consolidated matter and permits the complaint to proceed to discovery, setting the stage for either settlement or trial.  Specifically, the ruling first considers the general matter of whether the plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that they have Article III standing under the U.S. Constitution to sue Allstate. It then considers the defendants’ motions to dismiss for lack of standing under Rule 12(b)(1), and for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6). For context, a Rule 12(b)(1) motion contests the court’s subject-matter jurisdiction, while to survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), a plaintiff must allege facts that “raise a right to relief above the speculative level.”  “All plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged Article III standing,” the ruling states. “The plaintiffs claim that they lost retirement savings because the defendants breached their fiduciary duties, either by selecting and retaining the suite of Northern Trust funds or by causing the plan to pay excessive fees. ERISA makes fiduciaries personally liable for breaches of their fiduciary duties and authorizes recovery for fiduciary breaches that impair the value of plan assets in a participant’s individual account. The plaintiffs have alleged that the defendants caused a concrete and particularized injury for which the law provides redress. Article III requires no more.”  The ruling notes that some courts have held that ERISA plaintiffs lack Article III standing to bring claims regarding funds in which they did not personally invest, but this ruling concludes otherwise.  “In [this court’s view], Article III does not provide a basis to edit the details of a fiduciary-breach claim when each plaintiff has sufficiently alleged standing as to that claim,” the ruling states. “The standing inquiry is about whether a plaintiff brings a real dispute to court. The defendants do not contest that the plaintiffs have done so. Once that threshold is crossed, the proper scope of the plaintiffs’ claims become a matter for the merits, not whether there’s a case or controversy. The plaintiffs allege breaches of duty that harmed them, and that opens the courthouse door. This is not a case involving alleged misconduct in the sale of a product that a plaintiff did not buy; in those cases, there is no injury unless the plaintiff bought the product, because the only concrete harm was in the transaction for the product. Here, that the breaches of duty may have impaired the value of other funds does not mean that the plaintiffs have no stake in the duty breach—they do, because they were allegedly harmed by the same breach.”  The court’s analysis of rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) is fairly short and straightforward, again siding with the plaintiffs and determining that former participants may bring claims for benefits to which they are entitled and that these rules “do not provide a means to excise portions of a claim.”  The full text of the order is available here."

European Banking Authority,Proposal for a regulation laying down harmonised rules on AI act: EBF response,European Banking Federation | Media Centre | Latest Publications,European Banking Federation,"Proposal for a regulation laying down harmonised rules on AI act: EBF response  FROM THE EUROPEAN BANKING FEDERATION:  x  Proposal for a regulation laying down harmonised rules on AI Act: EBF response  BRUSSELS, 28 September 2021 – The European Banking Federation (EBF) welcomes the opportunity to comment on the European Commission’s proposal for a Regulation laying down harmonized rules on Artificial Intelligence (AI Act). The Act aims to develop an ecosystem of trust for AI in the EU, which encourages investment, aims to strengthen competitiveness and ensures that AI systems respect fundamental rights and EU values. It is essential for these rules to strike a balance between regulating high-risk AI use cases and supporting innovation, including proportionate requirements, no unjustified barriers or restrictions, and no duplication.  Coherence with existing, sectoral regulation and horizontal regulation, notably the GDPR, is also crucial. The Regulation should not lead to a duplication of requirements. The banking and financial services sector is already subject to strong sectoral regulation and supervision, which ensures consumer protection, risk management and financial stability in all services provided to customers, regardless of whether those applications or services involve the use of technologies such as AI, including in the case of creditworthiness assessment.  On supervision, while we welcome the designation of financial authorities as Competent Authorities for credit institutions’ activities, the supervision under the Regulation risks creating an unlevel playing field across different countries and industries if there is no consistency in supervisory expectations and practices among different national competent authorities. These divergences could occur when the same high-risk AI application, such as creditworthiness assessment and credit scoring, is concerned since different entities might be supervised by different market surveillance authorities. In order to ensure a level playing field for all industries in the application of the Regulation, the principle of ‘same activity, same risks, same rules’, must be taken into account, while ensuring a well-coordinated and harmonized supervisory landscape for all market participants providing or using high-risk AI systems and maintaining a high level of consumer protection to ensure that consumers have confidence and trust in the use of AI.  The EBF highlights the following recommendations:  A more targeted approach for the definition of AI is needed to distinguish between different systems and the scope of applicability. Given that the proposed definition will be the first definition of AI included in an EU Regulation and would be the reference for other potential rules referring to these technologies, the definition must be fit for purpose.  More guidance to clearly identify when the use of AI systems will be considered high risk and therefore subject to the requirements set out in this Regulation. This is particularly important in light of firms innovating and developing new use cases that may not clearly fit into the categories set out in Annex III.  Clarifying the scope of the creditworthiness assessment use case in the text – only those systems used to evaluate the access to credit should fall in the scope; AI applications used in the wider credit process should be excluded from the scope.  While the designation of financial authorities as Competent Authorities for credit institutions’ activities is welcome, ensuring i) coherence and a clear delineation with the proposal for a revision of the Consumer Credit Directive[1] (CCD) and ii) alignment with the EBA guidelines on loan origination, is needed.  To ensure a level playing field, guidelines or criteria are needed for each authority to follow and comply with for a harmonized interpretation and application of the AI Regulation for all high-risk use cases in order to avoid the risks of and that certain actors are subject to more stringent requirements in one member state than another.  The missions of the new European Artificial Intelligence Board must be better defined in light of the challenges of international competitiveness, innovation, and data processing (personal or industrial). The role of existing authorities and how they fit within this new constellation must be specified.  Including provisions on promoting measures that that support customer education and awareness raising on the Regulation and the use of AI, its real capabilities and its benefits for their users in order to address doubts at the member state level.

Introduction    BlackRock is committed to helping build a better, fairer society, starting with our own   organization. We believe that a strong culture, in which inclusion and belonging are   paramount, creates room for all of us to drive our purpose of helping more and more   people experience financial well-being.   BlackRock, therefore, welcomes the UK regulators’ commitment to advancing diversity   and inclusion across financial services firms.  BlackRock places particular importance   on promoting diversity, equity and inclusion (“DEI”), both within the firm and as an   integral part of our stewardship engagement with companies in which we invest in on   behalf of our clients.    As part of our long-term commitment, BlackRock has instituted a multi-year DEI   strategy that it believes is actionable, measurable, and designed to be relevant and   applicable in different parts of the world.    BlackRock has made a long-term commitment to increasing DEI across all levels of the   firm. BlackRock embraces the responsibility it has to its employees and to the   communities in which it operates, but also recognises the scale and depth of realising   success and the sustained focus and efforts required to advance DEI at BlackRock and   beyond.   We recognise that the promotion of a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace is an   ongoing journey, requiring continuous and persistent commitment from all levels.    Broadening the breadth of ambition in promoting diversity, equity and inclusion    BlackRock has evolved its approach and strategy to include a broader definition of   Diversity and Inclusion to include Equity as a key component.  For these purposes, we   define “equity” as   “everybody having fair access to opportunities to advance, succeed   and be their best, authentic selves”   and “inclusion” as   “the actions and policies we put   in place to ensure everyone feels like they belong – to be known, heard and seen”.     Support for use of a broad set of definitions and terms   BlackRock broadly supports the definitions used in the discussion paper and the need   for a broader assessment of characteristics beyond focusing solely on the legally   protected characteristics; this includes a more consistent approach to socio-economic   diversity and of assessments of neurodiversity, neither of which are legally protected   characteristics. We welcome the importance placed on “intersectionality”,   3   acknowledging that individuals have multiple aspects that shape their identities and   lived experiences that shape their diversity of thought, and we would also recommend   the regulators ensure that this lens is considered and reflected in any future policies.    Data underpins change   Collecting diversity data is an important first step for all firms in understanding the   diversity of their workforce.  It enables firms to identify potential under-representation   in their employee populations and workforce pipelines, as well as inform actions they   could take to address any such under-representation. It also allows firms to identify   any additional areas for improvement in relation to DEI (for example, in recruitment   and people and talent management processes). Data also enables firms to meet   applicable existing legal and regulatory requirements (such as UK gender pay gap   reporting obligations and potentially future initiatives such as ethnicity pay gap   reporting) and respond to client queries and expectations in relation to DEI-related   matters.    Data has to be usable and comparable and we encourage the regulators to work with   the industry and broader stakeholders on common standards to ensure the   development of high quality, consistent data practices. Self-identification rates   depend on voluntary disclosure by individuals. To build up trust and confidence in the   use of the data, and to avoid potential survey fatigue, which can lead to poor response   rates, clarity is needed on why data is being collected, how the information will be used   and transparency on the outcomes the data collection helped  to drive action. This will   help to reinforce individuals’ readiness to provide and update data. Many firms have   international operations in jurisdictions with different legal and data protection   standards and firms must be able to adapt their processes to local circumstances.   Application of scope and proportionality   Whilst diversity and inclusion are relevant for all companies – not just those in financial   services – regulatory application must reflect the different types and sizes of institution   which are regulated. A proportionate approach therefore is necessary as a ‘one size fits   all’ methodology could not operate across the plethora of regulated financial services   institutions. However, even in applying any requirements proportionately, we feel every   approach should principally seek to achieve the same diversity and inclusion   considerations and objectives, irrespective of the size, type or complexity of the firm or   its regulatory status.    As a global firm with employees constantly working with each other across   jurisdictions, we believe that it is critical to be able to articulate a common set of   expectations for our employees across the world.  A proportionate approach would also   take into account how firms set DEI policies and expectations globally to ensure that   UK operations are not carved out from a firm’s wider operations, but rather effectively   incorporated within wider internal policies. We also remain conscious of the need for   multi-jurisdictional firms, like BlackRock, to react appropriately to different local   circumstances.    BlackRock also supports the regulators’ approach to embed diversity and inclusion   within the existing regulatory framework and tools rather than applying an additional   regulatory regime. We believe that this approach may be best achieved through a set   of guiding principles, applied proportionately. We highlight the FCA’s recent letter on   ESG matters where the approach taken by the FCA has been to develop a set of guiding   principles to help firms apply existing rules. We consider a similar approach to DEI   4   would be beneficial. This would recognise that there are already pre-existing   obligations on DEI such as the Gender Pay Gap reporting obligations in the UK and   elsewhere, and that this remains an area which continues to evolve. These principles   should be complemented by supervisory scrutiny and challenge, to ensure regulated   institutions are acting appropriately and making positive changes to support greater   DEI within their organisations.   Training to drive cultural change   BlackRock understands that progress on DEI requires a long-term mindset with   sustained focus and persistence. One way to advance the firm’s efforts in this journey   is by raising awareness and educating its employees on issues relating to DEI.   We believe that a range of training programmes should be used to effectively promote   diverse workforces and inclusive cultures. These training programmes should reflect   (and vary as appropriate to take into account) a range of relevant factors, including the   nature and context of the firm, the seniority of the individuals involved and the extent   to which participants have people management and/or management and leadership   responsibilities.   To foster inclusive cultures, we believe all employees should take part in regular   dialogue and training to equip them to be able to identify and challenge potentially   non-inclusive behaviours and language. We believe this approach is effective in   holding everybody accountable, setting clear expectations of what is acceptable and   expected from employees at different levels and clarifying the potential implications   and consequences of not operating in that way. These programmes should be   designed with psychological safety in mind to empower individuals with particular   concerns and experiences to speak up and engage in inclusion dialogues.   Expectations of senior management and boards    In its engagement with investee companies, BlackRock takes a multifaceted approach   towards evaluating board diversity and the steps companies are taking to develop it.   We regularly engage with members of the relevant nominating and/or governance   committees to understand the director recruitment process and efforts to facilitate a   diverse and thoughtfully vetted pool of qualified candidates. We expect boards to   disclose their approach, actions, and progress towards achieving a diverse board   composition, including (in those markets where we consider demographic diversity a   particular priority) the demographic profile of the incumbent board. Investors and   other stakeholders can then assess whether they consider the approach taken by a   company to be appropriate given the business and broader context in which the   company operates. In identifying potential candidates, boards should consider the full   breadth of diversity, including but not limited to personal and professional factors.   In our experience, companies with engaged and experienced board directors with a   diverse range of backgrounds, experiences and skillsets, who actively advise and   oversee  management, have a competitive advantage. Specifically, we believe that   strong management and oversight practices help companies deal effectively with   material ESG factors relevant to their businesses. Companies can demonstrate such a   robust approach through the establishment of corporate governance structures which   facilitate proper board oversight of issues that are material to the creation of   sustainable long-term value, including the fostering of DEI.   5   Transparency   BlackRock believes that transparency to employees, shareholders and other external   stakeholders on how firms embed DEI within their business forms a critical component   of effective DEI policies.  For example,    as part of its long-term commitment to DEI, BlackRock has instituted a multi-year DEI   strategy that it believes is actionable, measurable, and designed to be relevant and   applicable in different parts of the world. Non-financial standard setters such as the   Sustainable Accounting Standards Board require firms to report on employee diversity   data.     We believe that the publication of DEI policies is a potentially valuable exercise, as it   may help drive accountability and clarity around what firms are focused on.  Given   expectations on firms to report on a variety of corporate sustainability criteria are   developing rapidly both at a domestic and international level at this stage we   recommend that the regulators do not prescribe a specific disclosure format, to avoid   the risk of duplicative reporting. Rather firms should consider what is the most useful   format for their stakeholders.  As practices develop, however it may be helpful for the   regulators to issue guidance to support firms in meeting best practice standards.   Charters (such as the HM Treasury Women in Finance Charter), can be useful for   organisations as they are able to set and publish their own targets as signatories and   then report against those targets, generating greater transparency across the   industry.   We would also encourage the regulators to engage in broad industry dialogue on DEI,   to share details of best practice which they have observed, and to articulate any specific   priorities for action in order to deliver a transparent understanding of regulatory   appetite and expectations.   Accountability as to progress   Both internal and external stakeholders are keen to see effective change on DEI.   BlackRock reviews its global DEI strategy at least annually, along with the corporate   policies and programmes that support it, so that the strategy remains aligned with the   firm’s business priorities and long-term objectives. BlackRock sets its ongoing   approach to DEI globally in its annual Sustainable Accounting Standards Board report.   Senior management for each business unit across the firm is required to conduct   Quarterly Business Reviews, which include focused reviews of their progress and plans   to achieve DEI goals. Year-end business assessments, which include a review of the   progress that is being made against the firm’s DEI goals, can potentially  influence   individual discretionary variable compensation outcomes for senior leaders with   overall responsibility for driving progress against those goals. Organisational strength   objectives such as attracting and inspiring talent, and developing a more diverse and   inclusive culture are also factored into overall performance assessments for some   senior BlackRock executives. These objectives include progression toward BlackRock’s   current target to have 32.5% female representation in senior leadership roles globally   by 2024, and continued engagement on increasing the firm’s focus on improved   recruiting and talent management of employees from as diverse a range of   backgrounds, experiences and skillsets as possible across the firm.   BlackRock prioritises regular dialogue with its employees about their experiences at   the firm in order to   6   understand employee expectations and assess the efficacy of its human capital   management practices. We use several employee feedback mechanisms, including: (i)   employee opinion surveys; (ii) interactive townhalls and communications; and (iii) the   sponsorship of employee, professional, and social impact networks. These employee   engagement mechanisms provide BlackRock with actionable fee"

BlackRock supports a regulatory regime that increases transparency, protects investors,   and facilitates responsible growth of capital markets while preserving consumer choice   and assessing benefits versus implementation costs.   We welcome the opportunity to comment on the issues raised by this consultation paper   and will continue to contribute to the thinking of HM Treasury on any issues that may assist   in the delivery of a wholesale markets regime which truly works for end-investors..   We welcome further discussion on any of the points that we have raised.   Yours faithfully,   1    BlackRock is one of the world’s leading asset management firms. We manage assets on behalf of institutional   and individual clients worldwide, across equity, fixed income, liquidity, real estate, alternatives, and multi-asset   strategies.  Our client base includes pension plans, endowments, foundations, charities, official institutions,   insurers and other financial institutions, as well as individuals around the world.   Daniel Mayston   Head of Electronic Trading and   Market Structure, EMEA   daniel.mayston@blackrock.com    Adam Jackson   Global Public Policy Group     adam.jackson@blackrock.com    2   Executive summary    We approach capital markets regulation as the representatives of end-investors – pension   funds,  insurance  companies,  and  individual  savers.  We  generally  interact  with  markets   through brokers and other intermediaries, rather than as a direct participant. But as our   clients’ fiduciaries, our focus is to promote capital markets that consistently deliver value   and meet the expectations of savers and investors.   We  support  the  approach  taken  by  the  UK  Government  that  seeks  to  promote  capital   markets  regulation  that  lowers  overall  regulatory  burdens  while  maintaining  high   international standards and continues to put the UK’s capital markets at the forefront of   innovation  and  technological  change.  These  are  desirable  outcomes  aligned  with  our   fiduciary purpose.    Our views on the proposals raised in this consultation document are based on what we see   as the fundamental principles of successful capital markets policy, which we believe should   guide HM Treasury as it takes forwards these proposals, and in developing capital markets   policy more generally:      •    Focus on the depth, resilience, and transparency of UK capital markets.   Markets   with  these  features  reduce  costs  and  uncertainty  for  investors  and  other  market   participants, to the ultimate benefit of end-investors supplying their capital to fund   the economy.      •    Set  proportionate  regulation  to  improve  end-investor  outcomes.    The  UK   government  has  rightly  stated  its  intention  to  maintain  the  high  standards  of   regulation  that  underpin  the  country’s  reputation  as  a  leading  centre  for  capital   market actvity. Today, the UK has the opportunity to tailor its rulebook in a way that   fits its own market more comfortably and lowers the overall cost of doing business,   while still maintaining these high standards.      •    Minimise  unjustifiable  regulatory  divergence  and  market  fragmentation.    We   welcome  statements  from  the  UK  government  and  regulatory  agencies  that   underline their support for open markets and competition. We also encourage an   approach  to  regulation  that  is  aligned  with  international  standards  and  avoids   creating  undue  cost  for  cross-border  firms  and  their  clients  without  delivering   improvements for either markets or end-investors.   With these principles in mind, we are mostly supportive of the set of proposals made by HM   Treasury as part of the Wholesale Markets Review, in particular:   Trading venues      •    The trading venue perimeter:   platforms that match multiple buy and sell orders   from clients against one another should be regulated appropriately, but this   regulation should not extend to technologies that only facilitate communication   or exchange of data, such as execution management systems. We would support   FCA guidance to clarify the perimeter.      •    SME markets:   we do see the need for further changes to company disclosure   requirements, beyond those envisaged in the recent Listings Review, and believe   the creation of a new trading venue for smaller companies is neither necessary nor   desirable. Instead, we look to the development of the Long-term Assets Fund   (LTAF) structure as one means of supplying companies with capital through   different phases of growth.   3      •    Outages:   it is critical for market participants to be able to rely on clear information   and processes in the event of an outage. We stress the potential utility of a   market-wide consolidated tape as a reference point in such events, and as a   means of improving resilience.   Systematic Internalisers      •    Midpoint crossing:   midpoint crossing saves costs for both parties to a transaction,   ultimately benefitting end-investors. The tick size regime should be focused on   preventing economically insignificant price competition for order flows, not   midpoint crossing.   Equity markets      •    Double Volume Cap:   we agree the double volume cap should not be carried   forward in the UK’s regulatory framework. ‘Lit’ and ‘dark’ trading venues are suited   to different order types, and we question the assumption that ‘lit’ trading is a   priori   preferable in all situations.      •    Share trading obligation:   we agree the share trading obligation should not be   carried forward in the UK’s regulatory framework; and support the FCA’s stance   that best execution for clients should be the guiding principle for where market   participants decide to execute trades.   Fixed Income and Derivatives markets      •    Derivatives trading obligation:   we support the alignment of the EMIR clearing   obligation and the MiFID derivatives trading obligation, the exemption of post-  trade risk-reduction services, and the proposal for the FCA to be able to modify the   application of the DTO.      •    Transparency:   we believe pre-trade transparency obligations should apply only to   instruments whose market structure is suited to them (i.e. instruments trading on   central limit order books, therefore excluding fixed income and derivative   instruments); with post-trade transparency applied to all asset classes, subject to   well-calibrated deferrals.   Market data      •    Consolidated tape:   we believe the government should take action to encourage the   development of a real-time consolidated tape across fixed income, equity   (including exchange-traded funds), and (in time) derivatives. This will mean   mandating the appropriate governance, commercial arrangements, and technical   standards; changes to legislation for mandatory contribution and formatting of   data; as well as regulatory oversight of the rulebook and guidelines for operating a   consolidated tape. To have its full impact, a consolidated tape should be   comprehensive, real-time, and – for equity markets – cover both pre- and post-  trade information.      •    Other changes to data:   we see the need for a regulatory mandate that all market   data should be licensed at enterprise level by investors at an enterprise level for   their internal use in the ordinary course of business. The fact that trading data   supplied by individual venues is unique and non-substitutable has allowed data   licensing agreements to become increasingly complex and onerous, leaving many   market participants with ever-increasing costs and operational risk.    4   Cross-cutting issues      •    Technology:   the UK’s continued ability to capitalise on new technologies has thus   far depended on being able to attract the right skills and talent from across the   world. We therefore underscore the importance of an open immigration regime   that is comprehensive with regards to access, geographic coverage, and in terms   of skills and income levels accepted.      •    Green Finance:   we commend HM Treasury’s intention to carefully consider how   best to deploy a taxonomy for economic activities; and how to develop sustainable   investment product labels to guide consumers. On the taxonomy, we stress the   importance of global consistency and cooperation; of careful thought being given   to why and how a taxonomy will be used before it is applied directly to the financial   sector; and that to fully support the net zero transition a taxonomy should assign   ‘shades’ of green to different economic activities rather than taking a   dichotomous approach to what is or is not ‘green’. On product labels, we stress the   importance of any categories created reflecting what end-investors need and are   demanding; and that proposals are rigorously tested on existing fund ranges   before implementation.      •    Retail investors:   we note the strong benefits derived by UK retail investors from   their continued access to a broad range of funds offered from both the UK and the   EU; and strongly encourage HM Treasury to avoid any measures that would   fragment the market for funds, or that would restrict UK investors’ access to funds   domiciled abroad. The Long-term Assets Fund (LTAF) has the potential to open up   a new area of the capital markets to retail investors, and we encourage steps to   make it available through both DC pension schemes and other appropriate   platforms.   Taken together, and if executed correctly, these measures should lead to capital markets   regulation  that  maintains  the  high  standards  the  UK  is  reputed  for  while  improving   outcomes for end-investors.       That  said,  we  believe    the  most  impactful  step  HM  Treasury  could  take  to  this  end  is   lending its full support to the development of a consolidated tape   across equity, fixed   income,  and  –  in  time  –  derivatives.  A  consolidated  tape  would  represent  a  meaningful   addition to the UK’s capital market ecosystem – as opposed to incremental gains through   improved  application  of  existing  regulations  –  and  in  turn  would  improve  market   transparency, liquidity and resilience, improving outcomes for end-investors and ultimately   underpinning the confidence to invest through the UK’s capital markets.   5   Responses to questions   Trading Venues   The trading venue perimeter   1.  Where do you think the regulatory perimeter for trading venues needs to be   clarified?   A clear perimeter is necessary. There is a need for appropriate regulation of platforms that   match multiple buy and sell orders from clients against one another. However, the   perimeter should not extend to technology that does little more than facilitate   communication or exchange of data without formally facilitating multilateral transactions   between multiple buyers and sellers. In order to avoid stifling innovation, platforms such   as execution management systems (EMS) that aggregate fixed income quotes, and which   do not have trading venue functionality (i.e. an MTF or OTF) should be regulated   proportionately, in line with their restricted functionality, and should not be subject to the   same regulatory parameters as exists for mainstream trading venues, such as stock   exchanges.   2.  Do you think it would be more appropriate for changes to be made to the   definition of a multilateral system in legislation, or for the application of the   existing definition to be clarified through FCA guidance?   FCA guidance seems a more appropriate approach to regulating these platforms, given   the need to keep pace with innovations in the marketplace. Any guidance should take   account of the distinction outlined in response to question 1.   Operating conditions for MTFs and OTFs   3.  Should the current restrictions on matched principal trading by an MTF be   retained?   4.  Should the current restrictions on the operation of an SI within the same legal   entity of an OTF be retained?   5.  If you answered no to question 4: Should new rules and disclosures be   introduced to address the specific conflicts that MTFs and OTFs would be   exposed to when providing MPT or operating an SI?    Questions 3, 4, and 5 are answered together here. We agree it is important that conflicts of   interest are properly managed, but do not feel there is a strong need for change to the   existing ruleset.   6.  Do you think that OTFs should be allowed to execute transactions in packages   involving derivatives and equities under their rules and systems?   7.  What would be the risks and benefits of allowing this approach?   Questions 6 and 7 are answered together here. On balance we agree that there is no   reason to restrict OTFs from executing packages involving derivatives and equities, and   removing it would simplify existing market structure.   6   SME Markets   8.  Do you agree that the existing regulatory requirements for disclosure at   admission to trading (for MTFs and SME Growth Markets) are disproportionate   for small-sized issuers?   9.  What principles and/or types of information should be considered when   developing requirements for disclosure at issuance to ensure requirements are   proportionate?   10. How far should these be determined by the venue operator versus regulation,   and what other features may provide proportionate assurances around the   quality of issuers admitted to a venue (e.g. role of advisors in process)?   11. Would the creation of a new category of trading venue be an appropriate means   to facilitate access to public markets for very small firms? What size of firms   would be appropriate for a new trading venue?   12. If you answered no to question 11: Would the facilitation of the creation of new   market segments be a more suitable intervention?   13. If you answered yes to question 11 or 12: What should the market cap of   companies that can trade on the new trading venue and/or segment be?   14. Do you believe intermittent rather than continuous trading would increase   liquidity?   15. Do you think that additional measures, such as new funds structure are needed   to stimulate institutional investors to invest in SMEs?   16. What, if any, further forms of investor protection do you deem appropriate for   this proposed new category of trading venue?   Questions 8-16 are answered together here.   We do not agree that further changes to disclosure requirements are necessary, and the   creation of a new trading venue for smaller companies is neither necessary nor desirable.   The recent UK Listings Review posed a series of important questions on how to encourage   more companies to list themselves on UK public markets. While there are some measures   the Government could take to make the prospect of listing in the UK more attractive for   smaller companies – for example changes to free float requirements, and temporarily   permitting the use of dual class share structures – we are not of the opinion that less   burdensome disclosure requirements or creating new categories of trading venue will be   additive.   At present, the UK has several listings segments companies are able to use: premium,   standard, and AIM (SME growth market). Anecdotal evidence suggests the different   requirements for each section have resulted in "

Investment Advisers Act of 1940,New US Digital Assets Bill Casts Wide Net,JD Supra | Elections & Politics Updates,JD Supra,"New US Digital Assets Bill Casts Wide Net  An ambitious proposal could bring digital assets into the mainstream regulatory fold.  During an eventful summer for the digital assets industry, it may have been easy to miss US Representative Don Beyer’s introduction of the Digital Asset Market Structure and Investor Protection Act (the Bill) on July 28, 2021. The Bill is perhaps the most promising effort to date by Congress to enact legislation that would address some of the legal ambiguities for digital assets and better define their place within existing financial regulatory structures.  Rep. Beyer described the current legal landscape for digital assets as “ambiguous and dangerous for investors and consumers.” Broadly, the Bill seeks to address deficiencies and/or ambiguities relating to consumer protection, trade reporting and transparency, and anti-money laundering / know your client (AML/KYC) procedures for digital assets.  The Bill also seeks to address a wide range of practical issues, from the fundamental (such as defining industry terms and categorizing cryptoassets) to the more nuanced (such as establishing standards for transaction reporting and consumer protection and advisories).  Security, Commodity, Other  The Bill would categorize digital assets as either “Digital Assets” or “Digital Asset Securities.” This categorization would then determine regulatory consequences and the allocation of agency regulatory jurisdiction.  The Bill would define a Digital Asset Security (in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Securities Act of 1933, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the Investment Company Act of 1940, and the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970) as a Digital Asset that provides the holder of such asset with any of the following:  Equity or debt interest in the issuer  The right to profits, interest, or dividend payments from the issuer  Voting rights in the major corporate actions of the issuer (which shall not include new block creations, hard forks, or protocol changes related to the digital asset)  Liquidation rights in the event of the issuer’s liquidation  The Digital Asset Security definition would also include any Digital Asset issued by an issuer with a service, goods, or platform that is not wholly operational at the time of issuance where such Digital Asset is transferred to the holder for payment, in order to fund the development of the proposed service, goods, or platform.  The Bill would also amend the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) to incorporate a broad definition of a Digital Asset as an asset that, among other things, is created electronically or digitally through software code and has a transaction history that is recorded on a distributed ledger or other “digital data structure in which consensus is achieved through a mathematically verifiable process.”  Joint Rulemaking on Digital Asset Classification  The Bill would mandate that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) issue a joint rulemaking no later than 270 days after the Bill’s enactment that categorizes each of the top 25 digital assets by market capitalization and also by daily trading volume under the bifurcated categorization discussed above.  SEC Oversight  Under the Bill, any Digital Asset that met the definition of a Digital Asset Security would be deemed to be, and regulated as, a security under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  The Bill would allow for a grace period before registering a Digital Asset Security with the SEC became necessary, akin to the Exchange Act’s treatment of issuers that are banks, savings and loan holding companies, and bank holding companies. An issuer of Digital Assets would be required to register a Digital Asset Security with the SEC:  No later than 120 days after the last day of the third fiscal year on which the issuer first has total assets exceeding US$10 million and a class of equity security (other than an exempted security) held of record by 2,000 or more persons  The Bill would also allow for the “desecuritization” of a Digital Asset Security at any time after it is registered as a security with the SEC. An asset’s status as a security could be terminated at the SEC’s discretion (and thereby rendered a commodity) if:  The issuer files a desecuritization certification with the SEC demonstrating that the issuer’s service, goods, or platform are fully operational and that the Digital Asset does not provide its holders with any of the rights that the Bill enumerates in the definition of a Digital Asset Security  This provision allowing for the desecuritization of a digital asset at a later date contrasts starkly with SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce’s Token Safe Harbor Proposal 2.0, which would provide a time-limited exemption at the outset for token-based projects that seek to raise capital to develop decentralized networks (see this Latham blog post for more information).  CFTC Oversight  The Bill would amend the CEA definition of a “commodity” to expressly include ‘‘digital assets (including Bitcoin, Ether, and their hardforks),” thereby providing statutory confirmation of the current market understanding that has emerged through SEC and CFTC enforcement and informal guidance.  The Bill would extend the definitions of certain CFTC-regulated intermediary activities — namely, those of futures commission merchants and introducing brokers — to include engaging in the relevant intermediation activities with respect to “any contract of sale of a digital asset in interstate commerce, but not a digital asset security.” As these intermediary definitions currently apply only in relation to commodity interest transactions (i.e., commodity futures, options, or swaps) and retail commodity transactions regulated as futures under Section 2(c)(2)(D) of the CEA, this would subject spot digital asset market participants to CFTC registration and regulation.  With respect to retail leveraged, margined, or financed transactions in commodities, the Bill would shorten the requirements for the “actual delivery” exception to Section 2(c)(2)(D) of the CEA with respect to Digital Assets to require delivery within 24 hours after the transaction is entered into, rather than 28 days (see this Latham blog post for more information). In doing so, the Bill would identify “actual delivery” of a Digital Asset to have taken place by reference to the time the relevant transaction is (i) recorded on the public distributed ledger for the Digital Asset; or (ii) with respect to Digital Asset transactions that are not recorded on a public distributed ledger for the Digital Asset, reported to a CFTC-registered “digital asset trade repository.” The Bill would introduce digital asset trade repositories as a new category of CFTC-registered entities subject to similar regulatory requirements as are applicable to swap data repositories.  The Bill would also amend the CEA to provide for an “optional federal charter” allowing for Digital Asset trading and clearing through existing CFTC-registered entities. In this regard, the Bill would provide the CFTC with exclusive jurisdiction over any agreement, contract, or transaction involving a contract of sale of a commodity in interstate commerce (including any Digital Asset) that is listed, traded, or cleared on or through a registered entity (e.g., a designated contract market or derivatives clearing organization). The Bill would provide that such contracts shall be treated for regulatory and enforcement purposes as if they were contracts of sale of a commodity for future delivery.  Stablecoins  The Bill would provide that, from the date of enactment, no person may issue, use, or permit to be used a Digital Asset fiat-based stablecoin that is not approved by the Secretary of the Treasury. The Secretary of the Treasury would be required within 90 days of the Bill’s enactment to establish a stablecoin application process through which the Secretary may approve or disapprove a person wishing to issue a Digital Asset fiat-based stablecoin. Importantly, the Bill would not grandfather existing stablecoins, and so would require an application for stablecoins in existence at the time of the Bill’s enactment.  Central Bank Digital Currency  To remove any uncertainty as to the Federal Reserve’s legal authority to issue a US central bank digital currency (CBDC), the Bill would authorize the Federal Reserve to issue “Digital Federal Reserve Notes” with legal tender status. Foreign fiat currencies, Digital Assets, and Digital Asset Securities would be expressly denied legal tender status, which could hamper digital asset proponents calls to move digital assets into the realm of legal tender (see this Latham blog post on the implications of El Salvador’s designation of Bitcoin as legal tender).  Bank Secrecy Act  The Bill would add Digital Assets and Digital Asset Securities to the Bank Secrecy Act’s (BSA’s) statutory definition of “monetary instruments,” thus subjecting them to the BSA’s AML and reporting requirements.  The Bill proposes to amend the BSA to define a “virtual asset service provider” (VASP) in such a manner as to exclude “any person who obtains a digital asset to purchase goods or services for themself; provides communication service or network access services used by a money transmitter; or develops, creates, or disseminates software designed to be used to issue a digital asset or facilitate financial activities associated with a digital asset.”  Financial Crimes Enforcement Network  The Bill would require the Secretary of the Treasury, acting through the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), to issue rules within 180 days of the Bill’s enactment that govern Digital Asset anonymizing services, money mules, and anonymity-enhanced convertible virtual currency transactions that are used to prevent association of an individual customer with the movement of a Digital Asset or Digital Asset Security.  Under the Bill, VASPs that are engaged in services that are available in the US and to US persons would be required to register with the SEC or the CFTC, as appropriate, even if the VASP were located outside the US. With respect to Digital Asset Securities, the Bill would require VASPs to meet the customer protection and account custody rules that are applicable to SEC-registered broker-dealers for customer funds and securities. With respect to Digital Assets, the Bill would require VASPs to meet the customer account custody and segregated funds rules that are applicable to CFTC-registered futures commission merchants.  The Bill would also require a joint report by the SEC, the CFTC, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and the Secretary of the Treasury, within 270 days of enactment “provid[ing] recommendations on the regulation, licensing, and auditing of digital asset custodians and digital asset security custodians.”  Decentralized Finance  While the Bill does not substantively address decentralized finance (DeFi), it would require a joint report by the Federal Reserve Board (FRB), the SEC, the CFTC, the OCC, and the Secretary of the Treasury within 270 days of enactment that (i) summarizes the current state and use of DeFi in the US, (ii) discusses whether DeFi poses any financial stability risks, and (iii) “provide[s] recommendations regarding appropriate regulation and investor protection for decentralized finance in US banking, securities, and commodities, including with respect to US jurisdiction and application of US law.”  Consumer Protection  Within 90 days of enactment, the Bill would require the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) to publish on their respective websites a notice regarding the treatment of Digital Assets and Digital Asset Securities and stating that Digital Assets and Digital Asset Securities are not “deposits” or “shares” covered by federal deposit insurance (regardless of whether an insured bank, savings association, or credit union holds the Digital Asset or Digital Asset Security). The Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) would also be required to publish a notice on its website regarding the status of Digital Assets and Digital Asset Securities and stating that Digital Assets are not deposits and Digital Asset Securities are (in almost all cases) not securities, and thus neither would be covered by SIPC insurance.  Conclusion  The digital asset industry presents novel problems that are not easy to resolve under current US law. Rep. Beyer noted in a public statement that “[o]ur laws are behind the times, and my bill would start the long overdue process of updating them to give digital asset holders and investors basic protections.” Legislative solutions would be welcome, and would help avoid the development of a fragmented and burdensome regulatory environment. Top regulators themselves have remarked on the necessity for legislative guidance, including SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who noted in a recent speech that “we stand ready to work closely with Congress… to close some of these [regulatory] gaps.”  The Bill demonstrates an earnest effort to provide greater legal clarity to the digital asset industry. Moreover, it aims to support the opportunities that the digital asset industry presents, while still applying sufficient safeguards and regulations to promote market integrity and consumer protection.  Industry participants have largely expressed appreciation for the Bill’s comprehensive and thoughtful approach, though some differ over the ramifications of specific provisions.  Some areas that merit further attention include:  Decentralization models need to have usable governance structures without such tokens being deemed securities. The Bill may be overly broad in stating mutually exclusive criteria that could define a digital asset security, and may capture many governance tokens as securities.  Although the Bill would require that the SEC and the CFTC issue a joint rulemaking no later than 270 days after the Bill’s enactment that categorizes each of the top 25 digital assets by market capitalization and daily trading volume, there is no indication whether such token issuers would be required to self-determine status prior to that official categorization, or whether such official determination would be subject to appeal. It would appear that self-determination of status would be required, because of thousands of digital assets in existence, at most 50 would receive official designation (although the number is in reality far less, as market capitalization and daily trading volume are highly correlated).  As noted above, the Bill would extend the definitions of certain CFTC-regulated intermediary activities to include engaging in the relevant intermediation activities with respect to “any contract of sale of a digital asset in interstate commerce, but not a digital asset security.” This provision would subject spot digital asset market participants to CFTC registration and regulation. While typically registration is an unwelcome development, this might be on balance a welcome approach if such federal regulation would relieve state licensing requirements under money transmission.  The net cast for stablecoin approval is potentially overly broad, as it would capture everything from global stablecoins to in-game payment mechanisms, such as the one described in the Pocketful of Quarters no-action letter (see this Latham blog post).  The requirement that “no person may issue, use, or permit to be used a digital asset fiat-based stablecoin that is not approved by the Secretary of the Treasury” as of the date of the Bill’s enactment would presumably lead to an immediate cessation of billions of dollars’ worth of stablecoin-related commercial a"

Basel IV,Does A Red Carpet Full Of Black Swans Matter?,JD Supra | Elections & Politics Updates,JD Supra,"Does A Red Carpet Full Of Black Swans Matter?  It’s coming up on awards season. The Emmys were last week and weirdly, I got a thought bubble about nominees in the Black Swan category, walking the red carpet looking for attention! Think the Masquerade scene from Phantom of the Opera when the Phantom comes prancing down the stairs to harsh the festivities (at least he sang well).  We have some obvious nominees today. But are they the real thing? Will they move markets? We have, with some reason, become inured to the disruptive headlines howling about threats to our way of life. Is there simply too much chaos out there to pick out the things which are really relevant from the noise? Our 24-hour news cycle is hardly helpful, is it? The talking heads, with practiced expressions of concern, seriousness of purpose and faux competence, serve up our daily quantum of fear and distress (Film at 11!). Don’t they seem almost gleeful to report yet another potential disaster? With breathy anxiety, designed to tug at our atavistic fight or flight instincts, they repurpose as news exaggeration, hyperbole, vague allegations, unconfirmed reports and sheer speculation.  The scary part is, of course, that buried and obscured in all that noise might be real news, things that investors and market participants really ought to be paying attention to because they will matter. The trick is sussing out the stuff that matters from the stuff that doesn’t.  So, we really do need to take into account these aspirational swans. One of them could be that figurative dead archduke.  Let’s take a stroll along the red carpet and chat up some of these swans.  Let’s start with our old friend, geopolitical disruption. Certainly, the ongoing horror show in Afghanistan is a thing. This adventure in grotesquery (there was virtually no risk, was there, that any of those helicopter pilots who evacuated the embassy back in August was ever going to land on the embassy roof, right?), it could have been something that moved markets and changed the calculus. But a black swan? Nope, not yet.  Well, then perhaps this sterling expression of American power and resolve might encourage adventurism around the world by the customary bad actors and such adventurism, or even credible threat of such adventurism, could roil markets. No one could have read about that “semi-official” Chinese news outlet publicly musing that the United States’ failure in Afghanistan should tell Taiwan that the jig is up without a frisson of anxiety. But a black swan? Nope, or at least not yet.  Then, of course, there’s the ongoing Covid mess which just refuses to follow the script of a good made-for-television movie. Started well. First, there would be a problem (check). Then our doughty heroes and heroines would engage in hard work and innovation to fix it (mostly check). Then the problem would be resolved. Throw in a car chase and a whiff of romance, roll credits, have a bit of a party and get back to work.  It didn’t happen, or at least it hasn’t happened yet. The plague goes on, the bug is still with us and looks like it might be indefinitely. Look, I’m not going to argue that life has not changed or is not still changing. Small business was and is particularly hard hit, but employment is up, GDP is growing and all the macro indicators are continuing to suggest expansion. There’s more of a feeling of momentum and a return to normalcy right now than something that has triggered fundamental change (check out any college football game this weekend). Doesn’t yet feel like a black swan.  For the moment, continuity wins and catastrophe stays in the Green Room.  How about the ultimate end (or not) of the vast amount of governmental largesse that has been rained on businesses and consumers (err…voters) for this past several years? It’s going to end at some point. Is its expiration a potential black swan?  The combined efforts of the current administration and the last, together with the Fed, moving mountains to avoid any possible threat of an economic downtown caused by a loss of liquidity, has been extraordinary. This has been an entirely unique fiscal and monetary adventure. We are literally off the charts. Here be dragons. The counterfactual is always the handmaiden of rank speculation, but assuming for a moment that all of that intervention, all that fiscal and monetary support had not happened, would we be in the economic wilderness today? We don’t know, but the economy is close to full employment, with moderate (transitory?) inflation and GDP almost fully recovered from the pandemic year. If, arguendo, all that financial support made a difference, what happens when it goes away? Are we back in the wilderness? Will the butcher’s bill come due?  While the occupants of the heights seem, at least publicly, confident that all this largess can be brought in for a soft landing, our track record of engineered soft landings is not, shall we say, sterling. If this Rube Goldberg-like complex of monetary and fiscal stimulus is not perfectly unwound, it’s hard to see how it won’t risk a significant economic disruption.  But it hasn’t happened yet. GFC 2.0 must still wait in the wings.  How about if it doesn’t all end any time soon? Want to talk about real inflation? Stagflation? All this fabulous stimulus and talk of a soft landing from the Covid mess certainly carries with it a significant risk of inflation. While many self-proclaimed experts continue to insist that inflation is transitory (because to admit otherwise is to admit our monetary posture might not be sustainable), there’s certainly evidence out there that it’s not. I get all the arguments about supply disruption, labor issues, material shortages, etc., but I’ll join the Milton Friedman team here and say that we can’t (or shouldn’t) ignore a vast increase in the money supply and a vast increase in liquidity occurring in a market without a concomitant increase in productivity and rapidly growing GDP and be comfortable that inflation is not lurking. Inflation or, God help us, stagflation, will impair value creation, drive up borrowing costs, dry up liquidity, destroy savings and strip any mojo from the economy and ultimately such continued excess itself will lead to a recession when someone finally goes all adult and does something about it (hard to see who that could be at this point).  Hard landing, recession; no landing, inflation, then recession. Are we acting like we’re about to spend time between Scylla and Charybdis? It sure doesn’t seem that way.  How about Mr. Biden’s gigantic combined infrastructure and “human infrastructure” (what a brilliant example of good word-smithing!) plans? Somewhere between $5 and $7 trillion of spending, and half of that or more in increased taxes over the next decade. Does that change the calculus? As I’m writing this, “who knows?” is about a precise an answer as I have heard about whether some or all of this passes and becomes law. Could the passage of some or all of this be the black swan we should be worrying about? Certainly, we’re not acting like it will be the sort of precipitating event which rapidly moves markets. Less a cliff and more of a boiled frog sort of thing? Maybe. But for the moment, along with geopolitical risk, and Covid, federal fiscal policy still seems to be a black swan wannabe.  Well, that’s all the obvious black swan nominees strutting the red carpet gussied up in their apocalyptic finery, but I have another one to consider, a bit stealthier and one that I actually think could, over time, change the calculus. That’s regulatory change. Oh boy.  Mr. Biden’s administration has a discernible progressive tilt these days, which has taken many by surprise since transformational change was not exactly the centerpiece of his return to normalcy campaign. But now? Talk is, of course, cheap, but the talk is pretty belligerent.  More regulation under Mr. Biden has always been in the cards.[1] For heaven’s sake, elections matter and the Democrats are in charge, a party with a congenital anxiety about, and indeed a certain hostility toward Wall Street, banking and finance. Couple that with a high level of confidence in the ability of government to make positive, important change, and you have the makings of a wave of significant regulatory action.  Remember people are policy. Look at the number of bona fide progressives who are taking seats in the administration. It’s pretty straightforward, isn’t it? How about the appointment of Barbara Roper to the SEC, or Lina Khan at FTC, and Mr. Gensler himself at the SEC? There’s Jared Bernstein at the Counsel of Economic Advisors and K. Sabeel Rahman at OIRA. Graham Steele to be Assistant Secretary of Financial Innovations and if Ms. Warren gets her way, Leal Brainard as the next Fed chair. All card-carrying progressives, all with an established track record of progressive views. There are no Robert Rubens or Lawrence Summers warming important seats in this administration.  Mr. Biden, right now, is trying to deliver a $5.5 trillion candy bowl budget of progressive policy goals, but he’s not likely to get everything he and Senators Sanders and Warren, et al, want. This will leave the progressive wing of the Democratic party seriously unhappy. That anger will have to be assuaged. What Mr. Biden will have in the toolbox to make progressives happy is broad and intrusive regulatory change. That’s the bone that must be thrown. (I note in passing that if the candy bowl is paired down with some Democrats’ complicit cooperation, it might be even worse. Nothing motivates the political animal as much as perceived apostates within its own caucus. The fire burns all the hotter for heretics and that will mean the regulatory action will have to be greater to serve an even more deeply annoyed progressive wing.)  When the White House goes looking for ideas for nifty regulatory change, there’s plenty to choose from. Take a look, if you would, at Senator Warren’s many articulated plans from the last presidential election cycle (and she is still at it…see her recent speechifying). Private debt is too high, banks shouldn’t be earning as much fee income, private equity is bad because it causes job losses, Glass Steagall should be restored and commercial banks fire-walled away from investment banking, executive compensation is too high and should be capped, there should be consequences for bank failures and financial disruptions and that means jail time for bankers, banks should understand that they have a societal obligation to provide leverage in some markets and deny it to others. That’s just a start.  And there are still goodies in the Basel IV goody bag and leftovers from Dodd-Frank, we’ll surely see the return of CECL and the full and aggressive implementation of the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book, the Net Stable Funding Ratio Rules and the Liquidity Ratio Rules which will all be used to reign in unfavored lending and investment. Some of the changes to the Volcker Rule adopted over the past four years might be reversed. There’s still more fun to be had with Pillar II. There’s the never resolved question of ratings agency reform and the possibility that the current SEC will embrace some sort of a rotation process among the main agencies, regardless of their competence, credit cultures or views of particular risks. That was one of the great bad ideas from Dodd-Frank but it’s still on the books; it’s still with us. Remember also that there was a notion in Dodd-Frank that perhaps the full panoply of public registration rules should be applied to all 144A transactions. How about that for good fun? Mr. Gensler was chatting up the Committee on Banking, House and Urban Affairs last week about SEC priorities and amongst them was issuer and underwriter disclosure in ABS. He mentioned in passing how enforcement and examinations must be more robust.  More disclosure, more compliance, the need to harvest more data, and more enforcement action. Moreover, regulations inevitably increase the level of risk aversion as folks worry that they are not meeting the dictate of their regulatory masters. In such an environment of higher costs and more risk aversion, lending activity will be torqued to meet administration goals and objectives.  Finally, ESG bears special mention. Whatever you think about its policy merits, ESG is going to be a can opener for a government trying to encourage investment in some aspects of the economy and discourage it in others. The existing budget identifies a lot of the winners (and by the process of exclusion, losers). Note that the European Union is actually considering risk weighting bank books to serve ESG goals. The prudential pressure to facilitate ESG goals and the pressure on the private fund community is enormous and while weather largely moves from west to east, regulatory enthusiasm seems to move from east to west and what’s happening in Europe is a harbinger of what may happen here. Perhaps you’ll love ESG’s winners. And why not? Mom and apple pie, right? But, the trouble with picking winners is that there will be losers. This focus on ESG will drive capital away from unfavored asset categories and I’m just saying, one of those is likely to be commercial real estate.  So, there are plenty of black swan wannabes out there, all of whom are flapping their little wings on the red carpet, none have taken flight, as evidenced by the fact that most macroeconomic indicators still point upward and certainly both the stock market and the debt markets are quiescent.  Just because we don’t have a winner in the black swan category just yet, does not, however, mean one shouldn’t prepare for when a bona fide black swan will strut down the red carpet. It’s going to happen soon, isn’t it? Come on, you know it is. Given the current state of play, it seems almost inevitable.  There are things that can be done, recognizing that disruptive change is more likely than not in the reasonably near future.  Thinking out loud, the following are all worth considering:  As a lender, don’t fight the tape. Embrace ESG opportunities. Embrace infrastructure. If the government makes it extraordinarily easy and lucrative to lend in the ESG infrastructure space while militating private risk through public intermediation, it’s time to lend there. Lend where the government leads.  As the regulatory burden increases (and this is dead nuts certain to occur) it will disproportionately impact the regulated banking community, creating competitive advantages to the alternate lending set and alternate lenders will provide an increasingly large share of credit to unloved (by the government) market sectors and that means, among other things, commercial real estate (will the non-banks continue to offer LIBOR next year and if so, what does that mean? A competitive advantage?). Continuing to raise money to deploy in the space is a good idea (though hardly an original one).  Many of our black swans are consistent with continued suppressed coupons. Alternately, if one of those black swans is inflation or stagflation, it’ll be inflation for the wrong reasons. It won’t be demand driven, it will be monetary excess. So even as rates rise, yield requirements will rise faster and we’ll continue to have a gap that needs to be managed between the needs and expectation of the users of capital and the providers of capital. Consequently, either way there will be sustained, ongoing demand for leverage through warehouses of various sorts and leverage through CLOs and CRE CLOs. Also true, in times like this, it’s a very good idea to broaden out your avenues to acquire leverage. You don’t really want to be all in in the repo market or in any other"
Hart-Scott-Rodino Act,Capital One CEO Allegedly Failed To Report Windfall Transaction To Antitrust Enforcement Agencies,JD Supra | Elections & Politics Updates,JD Supra,"Capital One CEO Allegedly Failed To Report Windfall Transaction To Antitrust Enforcement Agencies  The Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) reached a settlement with Richard Fairbank, CEO of Capital One Financial Corp. (“Capital One”), to resolve allegations that he failed to report a windfall generated by his acquisition of Capital One stock to federal antitrust enforcement agencies in violation of the Hart-Scott-Rodino (“HSR”) Act.  The complaint alleged that Fairbank’s did not report his compensation package, which included over 100,000 Capital One shares, to the FTC and the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) as required by the HSR Act in order to allow these agencies to investigate the antitrust aspects of the transaction. The complaint also alleges that the transaction was subject to a 30-day waiting period prior to closing, which Fairbank did not observe. The complaint further alleges that the Fairbank transaction violated the HSR Act even though Fairbank pledged to implement a system that would ensure adherence to HSR Act requirements after he failed to report similar transactions twice before.  Under the terms of the proposed final judgment, Fairbank will pay a civil penalty of almost $638,000. The proposed settlement will be published in the Federal Register and will be subject to a 60-day comment period, at the end of which the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia may approve the proposed settlement upon finding that it is in the public interest."
US Securities & Exchange Commission,Stocks Roar Back as Earnings Break a Negativity Bubble in the…,Tradestation | Market Insights | Events,Tradestation,"David Russell  Stocks Roar Back as Earnings Break a Negativity Bubble in the…  Stocks rebounded sharply last week as investors rushed back to the market following a month of extreme pessimism.  The S&P 500 rose 1.8 percent between Friday, October 8, and Friday, October 15. It was the index’s biggest weekly gain in almost three months.  The rally followed a basing period in early October as sentiment readings fell to their lowest levels in over a year. During that time investors worried about inflation, tighter monetary policy and the Delta variant of coronavirus. Three times, the bears tried and failed to push the S&P 500 below its September low. Then the selling pressure eased as reality proved less scary than investors had feared.  One big cloud to lift was inflation. Consumer prices were slightly higher than feared, but producer prices were below estimates. In both cases, spiking energy costs drove most of the increase. Next, the Federal Reserve acknowledged it may reduce asset purchases by mid-November. While these items are potentially negative, investors have had weeks to adjust to both.  But there’s another side to the coin: What if inflation and tighter monetary policy actually aren’t all that bad? After all, the inflation report showed new-car prices jumping the most (+8.8%) since 1980. That helped lift automakers like Tesla (TSLA) and Ford Motor (F).  Other companies benefited from higher prices. Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) was the S&P 500’s biggest gainer this week as the shortages drove copper futures to five-month highs. Alcoa (AA), no longer a member of the index, leaped 18 percent thanks to higher aluminum prices. Trucker JB Hunt Transport (JBHT) also had its best week since 2009 after revealing it charged customers 24 percent more per load in the third quarter.  Financials Jump  Next, the prospect of higher interest rates is a potential positive for banks and financials. Several major companies in the sector reported earnings, and nearly all beat estimates. Bank of America (BAC) had the biggest gain after successfully growing its loan book. Lenders are also benefiting as a healthier economy reduces the risk of borrowers defaulting, which lets the firms reabsorb funds set aside during the crisis last year.  Slowing consumption is another fear that isn’t playing out. Similar to the investor surveys, consumer polls show deep angst about coronavirus and the economy. But then actual numbers are crushing to the upside.  On Friday, for example, retail sales (real numbers) rose 0.7 percent, exceeding forecasts for a 0.2 percent drop. Meanwhile consumer sentiment (poll numbers) came up short. It was the second straight the real-world strength overwhelmed emotional negativity.  Bitcoin ETF  Last week’s gains were broadly dispersed across the market, with 10 of the 11 major sectors advancing. Communications were the main weak spot after AT&T (T) crumbled to a new 11-year low.  Solar stocks had their best week since March after China renewed its green push and Congressional Democrats made progress on a potential stimulus bill.  Bitcoin also jumped above $60,000 as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission moved toward allowing an exchange-traded fund (ETF). That lifted cryptocurrency-related stocks like Marathon Digital (MARA) and Coinbase (COIN).  Something else: The SPDR Energy ETF (XLE) broke a potentially important resistance level at $56. It’s the top-performing sector fund this year, but the worst since crude oil dropped below $100 in 2014.  Charting the S&P 500  Last week’s bounce occurred at the same 100-day moving average that’s provided support since October 2020. It planted the S&P 500 back above the 50-day moving average and a short-term falling trend line. That could make chart watchers believe the longer-term uptrend is still intact.  The rally also pushed Cboe’s volatility index (VIX) to its lowest level since the beginning of September.  Earnings, Housing This Week  This week’s agenda focuses on more quarterly results and housing. At least 74 members of the S&P 500 report earnings.  Today’s big event could be the SEC’s potential decision on a Bitcoin ETF. NAHB also releases its monthly homebuilder-sentiment index.  Housing starts and building permits are due tomorrow, along with results from Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Netflix (NFLX).  Tesla (TSLA) reports on Wednesday.  Thursday’s the busiest session. The economic events include initial jobless claims and existing-home sales. American Airlines (AAL), FCX and Snap (SNAP) are the big earnings reports.  Honeywell (HON), American Express (AXP) and Seagate Technology (STX) are some of the important names on Friday morning."
Fair Labor Standards Act,New Department of Labor Rule Exposes Employers to Civil Penalties for Pocketing Workers’ Tips,JD Supra | Elections & Politics Updates,JD Supra,"New Department of Labor Rule Exposes Employers to Civil Penalties for Pocketing Workers’ Tips  The Fair Labor Standards Act prohibits employers from pocketing workers’ tips. On Sept. 23, the Department of Labor finalized a rule that permits the agency to fine employers that retain tips intended for workers, such as bartenders and servers.  Under the finalized rule, employers face a fine of up to $1,100 per violation, in addition to remaining liable to workers for the amount withheld. The civil penalty is intended to incentivize employers to comply with their legal responsibilities and act as an enforcement mechanism when they do not.  While the rule strengthens protections for workers, it also increases the circumstances in which employers may be fined. Previously, the proposed regulation authorized civil penalties only when employer violations were “repeated and willful.”  The rule also explains that, while supervisors and managers who receive tips may contribute to tip pools, they cannot receive tips from such pools. Rather, supervisors and managers are only permitted to keep tips that they receive directly from customers, for services the manager or supervisor “solely” provided. The addition of the word “solely” is intended to prevent supervisors and managers from receiving tips for merely assisting workers who regularly rely on tips.  The rule is set to take effect on Nov. 23."

Paycheck Protection Program,SBA Expands COVID Disaster Loans,JD Supra | Elections & Politics Updates,JD Supra,"SBA Expands COVID Disaster Loans  Effective September 8, 2021, the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”) significantly expanded the ability of small businesses to apply for low-interest loans through the revised COVID Economic Injury Disaster Loan (“EIDL”) program. The program will end on December 31, 2021, or until funds are exhausted, whichever occurs sooner, suggesting that all applicants looking to apply should do so as soon as possible.  The COVID EIDL program is an “improved” version of the “regular” EIDL program that existed prior to (and will exist after) the pandemic. The purpose of the EIDL program is to help businesses meet operating expenses and financial obligations that would have been met had the pandemic not occurred. It is intended for businesses already in operation prior to the beginning of the pandemic.  Eligibility: An eligible business must meet the following criteria:  Location of Business: The business must be located in the United States or a designated territory.  Immigration Status of Owners:  For-profit businesses (other than sole proprietorships): The business must have a valid IRS-issued tax identification number and each owner, member, partner of shareholder of 20% or more of the business must be a U.S. citizen, a non-citizen national or a qualified alien with a valid social security number.  Sole proprietorships: U.S. citizen, a non-citizen national or a qualified alien with a valid social security number.  Note: As drafted these requirements do not apply to not-for-profit entities.  Size of Business: COVID EIDL size standards have been revised to include the following:  A business that, together with its affiliates, has 500 or fewer employees.  A private nonprofit organization that has an effective ruling letter from the IRS under 501(c), (d) or (e) of the IRS Code, or satisfactory evidence from the relevant State that it is a nonprofit organization under state law or it is a faith-based organization.  A business that, together with affiliates, has more than 500 employees, if it:  falls within a list of industries identified by NAICS codes, which include educational services (61), arts, entertainment and recreation (71), accommodation and food services (72), support activities for mining (213), industry group (213), beverage manufacturers (3121), apparel manufacturing (315), clothing and clothing accessories stores (448), sporting good, hobby, book and music stores (451), air transportation (481), transit and ground passenger transportation (485), 487 scenic and sightseeing transportation, publishing industries (except internet) (511), motion picture and sound recording industries (512), broadcasting (except internet) (515), rental and leasing services (532), and personal and laundry services (812);  does not employ more than 500 employees per physical location; and  does not have more than 20 locations. The 20 location limit includes the number of locations the affiliates have, if any.  Affiliate rules: An affiliate is any business in which an applicant business (i) owns at least 50%, (ii) has a right to at least 50% of profit distributions, or (iii) has the contractual authority to control the direction of the business. The affiliation is determined as of the agreements in existence as of January 31, 2020. Note: As drafted this does not include parent entities only subsidiaries.  Credit Score: For-profit businesses need to have a minimum credit score which depends on the amount of loan requested. For loans of $500,000 or less, a minimum score of 570 is necessary. For loans greater than $500,000, a minimum score of 625 is necessary.  Ineligible businesses include:  Businesses not in operation on or before January 31, 2020 (“in operation” includes businesses that were in organizational stages but had not yet opened for business).  Businesses in certain industries including a business that earns more than 1/3 of its gross annual revenue from gambling, a business engaged in multi-level sales distribution, lending, investment, or real estate development or investment (other than rental properties), most publicly owned nonprofit organizations, businesses whose owners had a past involving criminal activity, businesses that had revenue and did not file 2019 taxes and others. Note: It is not clear exactly how the real estate provision exclusion applies as some of the industries specifically targeted to be supported by this program (and that are the beneficiaries of the exception to the 500 employees rule) may also involve real estate investment or development. We would expect this inconsistency to be explained as this program moves forward.  Businesses that have filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy, are being liquidated under Chapter 11 and/or are permanently closed. Note: Businesses that are operating under an approved reorganization plan under Chapters 5, 11, 12 or 13 are eligible.  If the business had a change of ownership above 50% since the start of the pandemic, the business is not eligible for the EIDL loan unless the change involved a close family member or partner, or the contract for sale existed prior to January 31, 2020.  PPP: If the business had received a PPP loan, that alone does not disqualify the business from the program. The business may use EIDL funds to repay PPP loan (or other loans obtained from the government).  Terms of the EIDL loan:  Loan Cap: The maximum loan amount has been raised from $500,000 to $2 million per business. The aggregate loan cap for entities within the same corporate group (defined based on majority ownership) has been raised to $10M. Businesses that obtained prior EIDL loans may apply to increase their loan amount.  Interest: For for-profit businesses, the interest rate will be 3.75% over a 30-year fixed amortization period. For not-for-profits, the interest rate will be 2.75% over a 30-year fixed amortization period.  Amortization: Payments are deferred for the first 24 months from the original loan closing date, during which payments shall accrue, and then principal and interest payments are to be made over the remainder of the loan. There are no pre-payment penalties or fees. Additionally, the credit-elsewhere requirement will be waived.  Use of Funds: The EIDL loan can be used to fund working capital necessary to carry on the business and for expenditures necessary to alleviate the specific economic injury caused by the pandemic. This includes expenditures and debts such as working capital, prior business debts (for example, mortgages and credit card debts), payroll, the continuation of health care benefits, rent, maintenance, utilities, and fixed debt payments. EIDL loans cannot be used to expand the business. The EIDL loan can be used to fund the continuation of renovations, but not new renovations to expand the business or to repay debts owed to a federal agency.  Amount: The SBA will award the loan amount based on the following criteria.  If the requested loan amount is $500,000 or less: For applicants in operation before January 1, 2019, the lesser of (i) double the business’ 2019 gross revenue minus the 2019 cost of goods or (ii) $500,000 (whichever is less). If the business was not in operation on January 1, 2019 the SBA will calculate the maximum loan amount.  If the requested loan amount is over $500,000: The SBA will underwrite the loan based on a cash flow analysis. The maximum loan amount is $2 million per business.  Guarantee: A personal guarantee is required for all loans above $200,000 by all 20% or more owners and all general partners and managing members, regardless of ownership percentage. If no single owner owns more than 20%, at least one individual or entity must provide a full guaranty. No guarantee is required for nonprofit organizations or ESOPs.  Collateral: No collateral is required for loans up to $25,000. For loans over $25,000, the SBA uses a general security agreement to secure collateral. The designated collateral consists of existing business assets, such as machinery, equipment, fixture, furniture, or similar property. Businesses do not need to find new collateral, and the collateral does not include real estate or personal collateral. The collateral will be subordinated to prior debt (including mortgages). For loans over $500,000 the SBA also requires a best available (i.e., subject to any existing mortgages in place) mortgage on real estate owned by the borrowing business.  Forgivable: The EIDL loan is not forgivable, however, to the extent the borrower receives an EIDL Advance (which may be up to $15,000), that amount does not need to be repaid (although it may be deducted from any forgivable amounts under the PPP).  Exclusivity Period and Timing: Starting September 8th, 2021, the SBA is accepting applications for loans both under and over $500,000. The SBA will begin approving loans greater than $500,000 on October 8, 2021. The SBA is expecting to review applications within three weeks for requests under $500,000 and within six weeks for requests over $500,000. For applicants planning to request less than $500,000 and then apply for a subsequent increase if approved for the initial request, the timeline is expected to be a total of about nine weeks, resulting from adding three weeks for the initial request and six weeks for the subsequent request.  How to Apply:  Existing recipients: For existing recipients, the business should use the same sign-in to the portal. For businesses that have already submitted a Form 4506-T for a SBA loan or grant, the business must submit a new version of the Form 4506-T to apply for the revised EIDL loan program or for a loan increase. The recipient will then receive an email link, and can follow instructions from there.  New applicants: To apply for the loan, business are required to submit a signed and dated Form 4506-T. This form authorizes the IRS to release business tax transcripts to the SBA to verify the business’ revenue.  A link to the application can be found by clicking here.

Fair Labor Standards Act,New DOL Rule Adds Civil Penalties for Taking Employee Tips,JD Supra | Elections & Politics Updates,JD Supra,"New DOL Rule Adds Civil Penalties for Taking Employee Tips  In 2018, Congress added a provision to the Fair Labor Standards Act prohibiting employers from retaining employee tips or allowing managers or supervisors to participate in a tip pooling arrangement. Today, the U.S. Department of Labor announced a new final regulation in which the DOL asserts authority to penalize employers up to $1,100 per violation of this provision, on top of any back wages owed. Prior rules published by the Trump administration also provided for civil penalties, but only in cases of “repeated and willful” violations. The new rule allows the DOL to pursue penalties even for a first offense and regardless of whether the violation was willful. The rule defines “managers and supervisors” as those employees who meet the duties requirement for the executive exemption, whether or not the employees are paid on a salary basis or actually treated as exempt.  The rule is scheduled to be published in the Federal Register on September 24, 2021, and will take effect 60 days later on November 23, 2021.  The DOL is still working an additional rule that will govern how employers pay tipped workers who spend time on tasks that don’t generate gratuities, such as washing dishes or other “back of the house” functions. In June 2021, the DOL proposed dropping regulations issued by the Trump administration and returning to the longstanding rule that would require businesses to pay tipped workers at least the federal minimum wage for non-tipped activities when those activities take up at least 20% of a worker’s time in a workweek. The DOL is currently reviewing public comments on that proposal and is expected to issue a final rule in the coming months."
Hart-Scott-Rodino Act,FTC publishes report summarizing findings from study of unreported Big Tech acquisitions,JD Supra | Elections & Politics Updates,JD Supra,"FTC publishes report summarizing findings from study of unreported Big Tech acquisitions  Scope of the FTC’s study on non-HSR reported acquisitions by selected technology companies  In February 2020 the FTC voted 5-0 to issue Special Orders to five large technology companies (the Companies)1 requiring them to “provide information and documents on the terms, scope, structure, and purpose” of prior acquisitions consummated between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2019 that were not reported to the antitrust agencies under the [HSR Act].” The Special Orders demanded information similar to that required by the HSR notification and report form itself. The Special Orders were issued pursuant to the Commission’s authority under Section 6(b) of the FTC Act, which allows the FTC to conduct “wide-ranging studies” that are not directly related to a law enforcement purpose. In response to the Special Orders, the Companies reported a total of 819 non-HSR reportable transactions over the relevant time period (2010-2019). The 616 transactions valued at or above US$1 million were the focus of the Report.  Main findings  The Report “quantifies and categorizes the pace, the size distribution of transactions in dollar terms, the types of transactions, and the number of non-HSR reportable transactions collectively by the five respondents,” and presents its findings on an anonymized basis to protect the confidentiality of the Companies. The Report highlights the following findings from the FTC’s review of the 616 non-HSR reported transactions valued at or above US$1 million:  The number of such transactions per calendar year was highest in 2014 and relatively higher from 2015-2019 than in 2010-2013.  The highest number of transactions fell within the following technology categories: mobility devices and device-based software and content; front-end application software2 ; and internet destination and internet-enabled services.  The dollar value of the transactions generally trended up during the 2010 to 2019 time period.  Fifteen percent of the transactions exceeded the Hart-Scott Rodino (HSR) Act dollar threshold.3  Asset and Control transactions (including Voting Security control and Non-Corporate Interest Control transactions) were the most common type of transaction, with higher-value transactions more likely to be Control acquisitions.  Less than two-thirds of the transactions involved the acquisition of domestic assets and firms.  With respect to founders and key employees, a majority of the transactions utilized deferred or contingent compensation and/or included non-compete clauses.  Commissioners provide commentary on Report’s findings at open meeting  At the FTC’s open meeting on 15 September, the Commissioners and Chair Lina Khan provided their thoughts on what they consider to be the most significant takeaways from the findings outlined in the Report.  International deals: Chair Khan pointed out that the data shows that less than two-thirds of the non-reported transactions reviewed by the agency involved the acquisition of domestic assets or firms, which she said underscores “the importance of close collaboration and cooperation with [the FTC’s] international counterparts.” She noted the “significant expertise” that a number of international antitrust enforcement agencies have with respect to digital markets, and urged the FTC to “learn from partners who have excelled at institutionalizing a broader range of tools and skillsets . . .”  HSR “loopholes”: Chair Khan said that the agency’s findings demonstrate how “digital platforms can buy their way out of competing” by acquiring competitors through unreported transactions that are shielded from the scrutiny of the antitrust agencies.4 She stated that various “loopholes” allow deals that should fall within the FTC’s statutory purview to “fly under the radar.” In particular, she noted that the antitrust agencies must “guard against unduly permissive interpretations [of the HSR Act] that handicap” the agency’s ability to adequately review transactions and pointed specifically to the FTC’s recent determination that “the full or partial retirement of debt should be included in calculating a target’s acquisition price in any instance where selling shareholder(s) benefit from the retirement of that debt.”5 Chair Khan also suggested that “broader reforms to HSR may be overdue,” stating that the agency must continue to work to close “loopholes” in the HSR statute itself. Commissioner Chopra agreed that there is a “growing case to be made that the [HSR Act] should be amended to ensure that the very largest firms in the economy report more of their M&A activity to the antitrust agencies.” But more immediately, Commissioner Chopra highlighted the need for the FTC to combat “avoidance devices” used by parties to “disguise a transaction so that [it] doesn’t trigger the HSR thresholds.” For Commissioner Chopra, a dominant firm structuring a merger agreement so that the target firm pays off investors with a special dividend, “leaving the buyer free to take over the target at a price below the HSR reporting thresholds,” is a “clear” example of such an avoidance device.  Non-competes: Commissioner Chopra and Chair Khan highlighted the Report’s findings that many of the non-reportable transactions the FTC reviewed included employment provisions. Chair Khan noted that non-compete agreements played a role in 76 percent of the acquisitions analyzed by the FTC in its study and stressed the need for the Commission to “consider[] the use and misuse of non-compete clauses across the economy,” specifically with respect to merger agreements and how “firms in digital markets may be using acquisitions to lock-up key assets along with talent . . .” Commissioner Chopra pointed to 12 transactions that he said would have exceeded the HSR Act dollar threshold but for the firms structuring the transactions to include deferred or contingent compensation and the acquisition of debt or liabilities by the acquirer. He referred to this as a merger strategy known as “acquihiring”—providing a payout to a startup and its employees in exchange for the target’s assets and key employees staying on to work at the acquiring firm. He views such “acquihiring” as an avoidance strategy designed to allow firms to evade reporting requirements by making the takeover appear like an employment agreement rather than an acquisition.  Additional studies: Republican Commissioners Christine Wilson and Noah Phillips praised the Report for shedding light on the competitive impact of the unreported transactions that were reviewed. Commissioner Phillips cautioned, however, that the Report does not take a view on the competitive effects of particular transactions. He also noted that the study does not shed light on whether the trends reported are representative of the tech industry as a whole or other industries more broadly. Commissioner Wilson called for the FTC to conduct similar 6(b) studies in other industries and reiterated her call for the agency to analyze non-reportable deals in the healthcare industry.  Next steps  The FTC’s bipartisan support for conducting the study of non-HSR reported acquisitions by Big Tech firms and publishing its findings demonstrates the FTC’s continued commitment to scrutiny of the tech sector. While it remains to be seen how the agency’s merger review process may evolve in response to the findings outlined in the Report, there appears to be broad consensus among the Commissioners that employing the FTC’s 6(b) authority is a productive use of the agency’s time and resources. Accordingly, we are likely to see the Commission green-light new 6(b) investigations in other industries."
Equal Credit Opportunity Act,"DOJ, OCC Announce Major Settlement of Fair Lending Allegations",JD Supra | Elections & Politics Updates,JD Supra,"DOJ, OCC Announce Major Settlement of Fair Lending Allegations  In the largest fair lending enforcement action in several years, the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) on August 30 announced simultaneous settlements with a national banking association (the Bank) regarding alleged violations of the Fair Housing Act (FHA) and, in the DOJ’s complaint, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA). Notably, these are separate but coordinated settlements. The DOJ and OCC alleged that the Bank engaged in lending discrimination by redlining predominantly black and Hispanic neighborhoods in the Houston metropolitan area. The size of the settlements—a $3 million penalty and requirements to invest at least $5.5 million more on various initiatives—and the scope of the allegations in the DOJ’s complaint and the OCC’s consent order make one thing clear: Fair lending and other issues of “racial equity” will be enforcement priorities for the Biden administration.  What Happened  In October 2017, the OCC began a fair lending examination, including statistical analyses and comparisons to peer lenders, of the Bank. (The Bank asserts that it self-identified the issues addressed by the settlements.) The OCC concluded that the Bank had likely engaged in FHA violations by structuring its mortgage operations to avoid providing access to first-lien mortgage loans to residents in majority-minority census tracts in the Houston metropolitan area. On January 30, 2019, the OCC referred the matter to the DOJ.  Although the Bank operates about 100 branches across six states, there are no allegations in the DOJ complaint relating to any market other than the Bank’s self-designated Community Reinvestment Act “assessment area” in and around Houston. The allegations are fairly typical for redlining cases:  Branch concentration in majority white neighborhoods  Loan officers focusing on majority white neighborhoods  Outreach and marketing targeted at majority white neighborhoods  Disproportionately low numbers (compared with alleged peer lenders) of mortgage loan applications and mortgage loan originations in majority-black and majority-Hispanic neighborhoods  In addition, the DOJ’s complaint (filed concurrently with the settlement announcement) also references additional alleged deficiencies that may signal the direction in which fair lending enforcement is going. These include alleged failures to “hire loan officers with ties or relationships to majority-Black and Hispanic areas” and “to train its loan officers or other staff to take steps to serve the credit needs of majority-Black and Hispanic areas.” Moreover, the DOJ’s complaint references a lack of advertisements in Spanish, despite that over 700,000 people in the Houston area are Spanish-speaking with limited English proficiency.  The OCC’s consent order contains a $3 million civil money penalty to be paid to the U.S. Treasury. Under the DOJ’s settlement (subject to approval by the court), the Bank must invest $4.17 million in a loan subsidy fund for residents of predominantly black and Hispanic neighborhoods in the Houston area, $750,000 to develop community partnerships to increase access to residential mortgage credit in those neighborhoods, and at least $625,000 for advertising, outreach, consumer financial education and credit repair initiatives.  Why It Matters  This is the first of what we anticipate to be many fair lending enforcement actions under the Biden administration and the largest fair lending enforcement action in several years. The settlements also confirm that deficiencies in just one of many markets served by a lender can have substantial consequences. As noted, the settlement documents contain no reference to the Bank’s activities in the other five states it serves, even though the OCC presumably considered those other areas in its fair lending examination.  If lenders were still waiting for a reason to be proactive in identifying and correcting potential fair lending issues, this is it. Qualitative fair lending reviews of policies, procedures and marketing should be conducted to identify issues that create fair lending risk. Quantitative statistical analyses of loan data, including comparisons to peer lenders, should also be run. The DOJ’s complaint also alleges that it identified disparities in applications and originations between the Bank and its alleged peer lenders for a period of five years. Peer lending data is publicly accessible, so lenders do not have to wait for a potentially aggressive regulator to run the numbers. Risks can be identified and practices can be adjusted before the regulators arrive.  This case also highlights the importance of pre-acquisition due diligence. The Bank’s alleged white-neighborhood-focused footprint in Houston apparently originated with a merger with another bank rather than because of deliberate branch-opening choices. Notwithstanding at least some efforts by the Bank to expand its minority neighborhood footprint as a result of the known imbalance caused by the merger, these enforcement actions ultimately followed. Entities therefore need to make fair lending evaluations, including census tract footprint analyses, a core part of pre-acquisition due diligence efforts; good faith fair lending efforts in the aftermath may not be enough to stave off scrutiny."
