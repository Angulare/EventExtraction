"Ivanti and CrowdStrike target the cybersecurity poor
Security vendors Ivanti and CrowdStrike have announced a strategic alliance. It will see the two companies integrate their solutions so that customers can access them using a single interface.
This is the sort of integration that small business customers in particular want. They are tired of buying best of breed solutions and having to work in multiple management panes. It should also add value despite the overlap with some of the tools from the two companies.
Commenting on the partnership, Duane Newman, VP of Product Management and Marketing, Ivanti said: â€œWith more surface area to cover, more mission-critical assets to protect, and more sophisticated threats to defend against, IT Operations and Security teams must find a way to work together better to identify and protect vulnerable IT systems. Together, with CrowdStrike, we are helping our mutual customers reduce the attack surface and respond more quickly should a threat get through.â€
What are Avanti and CrowdStrike integrating?
According to the press release the two vendors are coming together: â€œto converge endpoint management and endpoint security, helping companies that possess limited resources combat cyber threats efficiently and in real time.â€
CrowdStrike is bringing its Falcon platform (AV, EDR, managed threat hunting and threat intelligence, IT hygiene) and Falcon Protect (anti-malware). Ivanti is providing its IT management tools such as discovery, patch and privilege management, whitelisting, and secure configuration. Combined in a single platform this will deliver a fairly comprehensive set of tools for managing endpoints and enforcing good security practices.
CrowdStrike delivers its tools through the cloud. This will appeal to companies who do not want a heavyweight on-premises solution. It will also be attractive to small to mid-sized companies who lack cybersecurity teams and skills.
This is not just about detecting and stopping threats. The IT management and hygiene tools will enable companies to improve the deployment of patches. This will, in turn, reduce the attack surface and enable them to improve IT security.
The press release calls out the following benefits to joint customers:
Faster remediation of prioritized threats to keep the endpointsâ€™ data protected
Deeper protection and control over employeesâ€™ devices
Better insight and visibility into security incidents and better time to resolution
What does this mean?
Too many SMEs are struggling to manage their IT estate. They not only have the problem of managing hardware owned by the company but also BYOD devices owned by users. The ability to enforce patch requirements by sandboxing any device missing security patches is a good move. It reduces the risk that a user will bring an infected device into the business and infect other machines.
There is also a substantial user benefit here as well. Many users are not sure what endpoint protection to buy for their personal devices. Some, especially those using Apple, tend to have no third-party protection on their devices. With this combined solution, IT can make security available to users. As it is cloud-based, it means users can keep their devices patched and protected even if they rarely visit the company office.
There is new legislation covering network and data security coming into force this year. This announcement targets those companies who are unlikely to have the money to do security audits. It will be interesting to see how many customers of both companies take it on and how many new customers the vendors sign up.",4

Led by Lee Fixel's Addition, Primer has secured funding to propel its next phase of growth, including international expansion and strategic alliances with Microsoft and Palantir to serve mission-critical US Government needs
SAN FRANCISCO, June 22, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Primer, the leading Natural Language Processing (NLP) firm, today announced the close of a $110M Series C round led by Lee Fixel's Addition. New strategic investors include Steadfast, Sands Capital, and Hank Crumpton, former Ambassador-at-Large and US Coordinator for Counterterrorism. Existing investors Lux Capital, DCVC, Amplify Partners and more also participated. Primer also announced an integration with Microsoft Corporation to make Primer natively available within Microsoft Azure, as well as a partnership with Palantir Technologies, Inc. to make Primer available within the Palantir platform to deploy operational AI to US Government missions.
Organizations collect and create much more data than human analysts can handle. As a result, much of it remains unexplored or underutilized. Primer's industrial-grade NLP platform enables organizations to create structure and pull insights from vast amounts of data to support faster decision-making. Primer's NLP technology can effectively read and write in English, Russian, Chinese and Arabic. This technology has been proven in national security and intelligence domains to meet the highest standards. Recently, a financial technology company found that Primer's out-of-the-box Named Entity Recognition model outperformed the competition on average by 42%. The new funding will enable Primer to step up recruiting efforts both in the US and globally, as it seizes on the vast addressable market for NLP. Starting with new offices in London and Singapore, the company is set to expand its footprint across Europe and Asia.
Following the Series C, Lee Fixel has joined Primer's board. Lee brings deep expertise in scaling high growth companies, having served on the boards of Warby Parker, Flipkart, and Freshworks. He has also led key investments in Palantir, Stripe, and Spotify.
""Primer is transforming how we read, write, and perform advanced analysis on unstructured data to drive decision-making,"" said Lee Fixel. ""Primer's impressive growth is underpinned by the strength of its NLP technology.Â We look forward to supporting the company as it continues to drive innovation across both the public and private sector.""
""NLP is undergoing a revolution as artificial intelligence continues to push the boundaries of machine performance in reading and writing tasks,"" said Sean Gourley, CEO & Founder of Primer. ""We are now able to build machines that can achieve human level performance in many tasks from information extraction, to document classification to summarization. Series C capital will allow us to build larger and better performing language models and make those available across industries, from defense and intelligence to finance and health care.""
""Having dedicated most of my life to intelligence and having spent decades leading critical missions where information was essential in shaping our understanding of the operational landscape, I understand the value of Primer's technology,"" said Hank Crumpton, former Ambassador-at-Large and US Coordinator for Counterterrorism. ""Primer is already reshaping the way we assess and scale intelligence capabilities. I'm proud of the team and their mission to realize the responsible power of artificial intelligence.""
Today, Primer also announced a partnership with Palantir to empower analysts, decision-makers, and warfighters with sophisticated AI-enabled decision-making technology to succeed in their missions, from HQ to the tactical edge. By making Primer's world-class AI and NLP available within the Palantir platform, federal clients can tackle the vast troves of data that exist in today's worldâ€”a major hurdle for organizations seeking to extract key networks and facts from highly dynamic situations. Palantir's Apollo for Edge AI technology brings the power of AI micromodels to the edge, unlocking rapid mission system reconfiguration to provide AI insights for warfighters in the field. Drawing on readily integrated enterprise data in the Palantir platform via open APIs, Primer's NLP capabilities surface hard-to-find insights from that data in near real-time and with full historical context. Primer's industrial-grade NLP engines are a natural partner to Palantir, with Primer's AI continuously providing insights that empower users to understand key nodes and relationships with Palantir's platform. With this seamless integration, users automatically receive AI insights as new data comes in and can make decisions with a complete view of their operations with unprecedented speed.
To better serve the most sensitive, mission-critical needs of the U.S. government and its allies, Primer is joining forces with Microsoft to make Primer available within Microsoft's Azure cloud computing platform. Primer and Microsoft will also collaborate on serving larger and more complex customers and contracts together, making it easier for intelligence teams to integrate Primer's technology into their existing workflows, including those running on the Azure Government Secret and Azure Government Top Secret services.
The company will build on the recent commercial release of Primer Automate, a no-code solution for users to build and train their own NLP models on their data. Automate offers a number of NLP Engines straight off-the-shelf. Primer Analyze further democratizes access to intelligence through a scalable, self-curating knowledge base that can analyze billions of documents in seconds. This unique capability allows analysts to quickly search through large-scale document caches and databases to extract the information that matters the most. Primer's products and models sit on top of its proprietary NLP technology, which is built on transformer-based neural networks, making its solutions models faster, more accurate, and easy to retrain.
With Primer, organizations can now train, retrain, build and deploy world-class AI and NLP technology for their specific needs. Continuously driving its technology forward, Primer is proud to bring industrial-grade NLP solutions to more organizations worldwide.
About Primer
Primer builds machines that can read and write. We make it easy for organizations to bring industrial grade NLP into their mission-critical operations.

Marketing Technology News:Â GetAccept Secures $20 Million in Series B Funding

"CrowdStrike & EY Announce Expansion of Alliance to Provide Joint Cyber Offerings to Help Combat Ransomware & Accelerate Zero ...
CrowdStrike Falcon selected as one of the EY preferred cybersecurity technology platforms
CrowdStrike Inc., a leader in cloud-delivered endpoint protection and workload protection, and Ernst & Young LLP (EY US), a leading organization in cyber risk consulting services, today announced that CrowdStrike Falcon has been selected as one of the EY preferred cybersecurity technology platforms, strengthening the alliance between the two industry leading organizations. The development of the alliance introduces an expansion into new geographies as well as new joint offerings: Ransomware Readiness and Resilience, Incident Response (IR), Recovery and Remediation, and the acceleration of Zero Trust capabilities.
The CrowdStrike-EY Alliance seamlessly integrates cybersecurity operations and risk management to help aid enterprises around the world, and bolster business resiliency. The CrowdStrike and EY teams are committed to helping customers in new areas as the alliance continues to grow outside the U.S. Recently, the alliance expanded into Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada and Italy.
Combating ransomware threats and attacks
A key focus of the EY and CrowdStrike alliance is aimed at thwarting ransomware attacks, as this form of cyberattack continues to gain momentum and sophistication from both cyber criminals and state-sponsored threat actors. Ransomware attacks take advantage of security gaps at multiple levels when it comes to people, process, and technology and continue to plague entities ranging from small businesses all the way up to mature, global organizations. In response, EY and CrowdStrike professionals have joined forces to create the Ransomware Readiness and Resilience solution â€“ a multi-pronged strategy to effectively combat these threats.
The Ransomware Readiness and Resilience solution combines EY Next-Generation Security Operations and Response (NGSO&R) services with the CrowdStrike FalconÂ® platform, providing industry-leading protection and detection capabilities with cyber threat intelligence and 24/7 threat hunting to offer a leading solution in the fight against ransomware threats. The solution offers immediate, real-time visibility into the organizationsâ€™ environments, identifying and eliminating potential compromises and curtailing silent failure. This powerful combination helps to contain active threats immediately and efficiently mitigates the threat of ransomware attacks.
Shawn Henry, CrowdStrike chief security officer and president of Services, says:
â€œWe continue to hear from our customers that dangerous cyber actors threaten the livelihood of their business operations. CrowdStrike and EY have teamed up to offer our joint customers market-leading technology paired with leading transformational consulting services to aid organizations and positively impact their business objectives through the prioritization of cybersecurity. We are thrilled about the maturing of this collaboration and look forward to helping more businesses around the world grow their business resiliency and security posture.â€
Response, recovery and remediation
EY and CrowdStrike teams have also joined forces to offer customers a new broad approach to respond quickly and precisely in the wake of an incident. Incident Response, Recovery and Remediation helps customers rapidly contain an attack and recover from a breach with speed and surgical precision, using the threat intelligence and real-time response capabilities of CrowdStrikeâ€™s technology and services. CrowdStrikeâ€™s IR strengths, along with EYâ€™s proactive and reactive incident response plans, encompass all aspects of a clientâ€™s cybersecurity program and threat response. IR, Recovery and Remediation provides an understanding of the full threat context to rapidly recover endpoints and get customers back to normal business operations faster. This helps clients to increase overall business resiliency while meeting compliance and governance requirements.
Additionally, EY and CrowdStrike teams have integrated the acceleration of Zero Trust adoption, leveraging CrowdStrike Falconâ€™s Zero Trust solutions to process trillions of events in real-time and continuously validate the access of resources for all users, devices and applications, regardless of the location. Utilizing the expansive telemetry of the CrowdStrike Security Cloud, customers benefit from high fidelity attack correlation, fast policy enforcement, and dynamic conditional access based on continuous, real-time security risk assessments, helping ensure frictionless Zero Trust adoption and identity protection for organizations of any size.
Dave Burg, EY Americas cybersecurity leader, says:
â€œThe threat of cybersecurity attacks remains top of mind for EY clients and the expanded global alliance with CrowdStrike will be invaluable as they continue navigating increasing cyber threats. Through this collaboration, EY and CrowdStrike teams aim to address growing concerns regarding ransomware and how to manage a potential incident through the new Ransomware Readiness and Resilience, and IR, Recovery and Remediation solutions. Strengthening this alliance means supporting clients where theyâ€™re most vulnerable so they can focus on running their business.â€

Citiâ€™s Treasury and Trade Solutions will integrate transaction monitoring technology fromÂ Feedzai.Â The integration comes courtesy of a newly-announced strategic partnership, and reflects a relationship that extends back to 2016, when Citi Ventures made a strategic investment in theÂ AI-based real-time risk management solution provider.
â€œCiti is one of the most successful banks in the world for a reason, because they invest in their customersâ€™ experience,â€ Feedzai CEO and co-founder Nuno Sebastiao said. â€œWeâ€™re proud to continue working together to be part of that innovation that helps Citi to continue to show the world what world-class digital transformation for banks looks like.â€
Powered by advanced machine learning technology, Feedzaiâ€™s transaction monitoring platform will combine with Citiâ€™s proprietary services and platforms to give clients better control and risk management for payment transactions. The technology analyzes and identifies potential customer payment behavior anomalies before the payments are sent for clearing, while at the same time ensuring prompt and efficient processing. Citi plans to go live with a new, Feedzai-powered risk management solution in 2019.
â€œOur strategic partnership with Feedzai demonstrates our deep commitment to using technology to drive innovation,â€ said Manish Kohli, Global Head of Payments and Receivables for Citiâ€™s Treasury and Trade Solutions. â€œWith the help of Feedzaiâ€™s solution, we can scale rapidly in an effort to deliver value to our clients, allowing them to make payments securely, efficiently, and without friction, across the globe,â€ Kohli said.
Feedzaiâ€™s strategic partnership news comes just a few weeks after the company announced the release of its financial crime prevention solution, Risk Ledger. This summer, Feedzai announced that it would offer its machine learning technology, AutoML, to automate and streamline the work of data scientists. A partnership with e-commerce bank, Credorax, reported in July, will empower the merchant acquisition specialist to offer better anti-fraud protections for its partners.
Founded in 2008 and based in San Mateo, California, Feedzai demonstrated its fraud prevention technology at FinovateEurope 2014. The companyâ€™s platform scores $5 billion in transactions daily and protects 10 of the largest 25 global banks against transaction fraud. Feedzai has raised $82 million in funding from investors including Data Collective DCVC, Sapphire Ventures, Citi Ventures, and Oak HC/FT.
Citi participated in our developers conference, FinDEVr New York 2017, providing a discussion on OAuth tokenization and the companyâ€™s Developer Hub.

IPC and Digital Reasoning Announce Global Strategic Partnership to Deliver Most Advanced Voice Surveillance for Financial Services
Partnership enables financial institutions to analyze voice surveillance data and reduce regulatory risks
NEW YORKÂ andÂ LONDON,Â June 23, 2020Â /PRNewswire/ â€”Â IPC, a leading global provider of secure, compliant communications and networking solutions for the financial markets community, today announced a strategic partnership withÂ Digital Reasoning, the global leader in artificial intelligence solutions that understand human communications and behaviors. The strategic partnership will allow financial institutions to analyze all of their voice surveillance data to identify regulatory risks faster so they can take action sooner.
â€œWe are always focused on delivering extraordinary value and an exceptional experience for our customers,â€ said Bob Santella, Chief Executive Officer, IPC. â€œTo that end, we are excited to partner with Digital Reasoning so we can leverage their proven, cutting-edge artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies that will enable our customers to analyze all their voice surveillance data, better protect their reputations andÂ reduce overall risk.â€
Although voice currently has the lowest surveillance coverage, it has the highest levels of regulatory violations. Poor speech recognition and low-quality alerts along with hardware issues and expensive reviews forced banks to randomly sample their voice communications. Often, as little as 5% of calls were actually monitored. As a result, there was a significant increase in risk exposureÂ and financial institutions were not aware of activities that would subsequently result in steep fines.
With 6,600+ connected locations in over 750 cities in more than 60 countries, IPC operates one of the worldâ€™s largest financial ecosystems and cloud-enabled communities. Now, through this global strategic partnership, financial institutions everywhere will be able to monitor and analyze all of the voice data, identify risks much faster, and have the assurance that they are reducing their regulatory exposure and holding their employees to the highest standards of conduct.
â€œWeâ€™re absolutely thrilled to partner with an industry leader like IPC. They are recognized and respected by financial institutions around the world for their award-winning trading communications platform, and they are uniquely positioned to advance voice surveillance,â€ saidÂ Tim Estes, Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Digital Reasoning. â€œThe combination of IPCâ€™s multi-cloud financial ecosystem and our intelligent software, which analyzes human communications at scale, results in financial institutions being able to cost-effectively monitor voice communications and lower their risk exposure.â€

"Payfone to work with major banks on mobile banking authentication
Payfone this week emerged from a two-year quiet period to introduce a new authentication product that relies on the same security standards mobile network operators use to identify their subscribers.
The New York-based company will pilot its product, called Identity Certainty, with three major financial institutions in the first quarter of 2015 through a partnership with fraud protection and risk management company Early Warning.
Payfone did not reveal which banks will use the service, but Early Warning is a limited liability company owned by Bank of America, BB&T, Capital One, Chase and Wells Fargo. Early Warning also is a Payfone investor.
At its core, Identity Certainty is an extra layer of protection banks can use to confirm a mobile banking customerâ€™s identity when they log into the service. Mobile identity authentication has become more important for banks as consumers migrate away from online banking to a smartphone or tablet. Consumers' changing preferences combined with emerging technology has forced financial institutions to take a closer look at how they identify and authenticate mobile banking users when they log into their account.
""Banks have learned that a lot of things that can be done on the PC [for authentication] donâ€™t translate well to the mobile phone,"" Roger Desai, Payfone CEO, told Mobile Payments Today in an interview. ""What the banks wanted us to do was create a consistent way to identify a phone.""
Payfone already has 300 million mobile identities in its database thanks to partnerships with all four major telcos in the U.S. The company assigns each identity a unique tokenized ID thatâ€™s based on mobile subscriberâ€™s phone number, SIM card and account number. Banks use the tokenized ID to make sure everything lines up with their systems.
Identity Certainty tracks 400 different ""lifecycle"" events to help banks confirm a customerâ€™s mobile identity.
Some events occur more often than others, such as an address change, a new phone number, a replacement for a lost device. Other events are less frequent, such as a consumer switching mobile operating systems or using a company-provided device.
""All of these things are critical for the bank to know,"" Desai said. ""We eliminate human interaction when it comes to this authentication method. Itâ€™s done behind the scenes through the telcoâ€™s network.""
""This kind of authentication works because lots of things change with customers that the banks have a hard time tracking.""
A bankâ€™s need to track that information is becoming more important as mobile cybercrime continues to increase.
Symantec Corp.â€™s most recent Norton Report about cybercrime revealed inefficient authentication methods are among the primary reason for mobile fraud incidents. And consumers are not doing their part to safeguard their information on those devices.
Payfoneâ€™s system eliminates the need to depend on the device and user in the identification process, Desai said. Identity Certainty also features a ""kill switch"" option that terminates access to apps and services in real-time when a mobile subscriber reports a lost or stolen device.Â 
Apple Pay help
Desai noted one area where banks should see value in Identity Certainty is with Apple Pay provisioning. One thing Apple canâ€™t prevent with its new mobile payment service is a fraudster loading someone elseâ€™s card into an iTunes account.
""All Iâ€™d have to do is set up an iTunes account with your name and address, wait 40 days so that itâ€™s an aged account and what will happen is that iTunes will send that information to your bank and make sure it matches with what the bank has on file for your card and thatâ€™s it,"" he said.
Desai claims right now banks have a difficult time confirming the identity of legit Apple Pay users because their personal information is outdated.
""The Tier 1 banks are telling us half of the provisions for Apple Pay are going [down a cautionary] path, which requires manual intervention, which costs money and creates a lot of fiction,"" he said. ""[Identity Certainty] can come in to help identify the userâ€™s phone.
""On the flip side, someone could be loading your card to Apple Pay, and the system would alert the bank to call the person who owns the card.""

This gave Capital One UK, as well as other card issuing banks, a completely automated way to stop and recover card-not-present (CNP) fraud losses through a simple and highly effective integration. As a result, participating merchants on the Ethoca Network were able to stop and refund/avoid settlement on 394% more fraudulent transactions on a monthly basis (compared to the previous manual file process). Meanwhile, Capital One UK ensured the best possible experience for its cardholders and eliminated unnecessary operating expenses while also making the most of its existing IT investments.
Speaking on the commendation, Keith Briscoe, Ethocaâ€™s Chief Marketing Officer, commented: â€œWeâ€™re thrilled to be acknowledged for our work with TSYS and Capital One UK to reduce fraud and improve the customer experience. Weâ€™re pleased the judges recognised the power of the TSYS Transaction Recovery Network (powered by Ethoca), which provides near real-time notification of confirmed fraud that empowers issuers like Capital One UK, as well as merchants, to quickly recover lost revenue and eliminate the need for expensive and time-consuming chargeback processes.â€
â€œWith the continued growth of online commerce, it takes a constant effort to develop new, and innovative ways to combat the corresponding increase in fraud,â€ says Karim Ahmad, EVP Global Product and Innovation for TSYS. â€œThe TSYS Transaction Recovery Network powered by Ethoca was developed as a collaborative, efficient solution that reduces online fraud and the operational expenses associated with chargebacks. This recognition by The Card & Payments Awards is a testament to the value we have been able to create in this area though our partnership with Capital One UK and Ethoca.â€
â€œCapital One is delighted to be highly commended in the Industry Innovation of the Year category in partnership with Ethoca and TSYS,â€ says Rob Harding, Managing Vice President, Capital One (Europe). â€œThe team have worked together to automate notifications of fraudulent purchases in real-time to retailers so that orders can be quickly cancelled, reducing fraud throughout the payments ecosystem.â€
The annual Card & Payments Awards, which took place on Thursday, 1st February at the Grosvenor House Hotel in Londonâ€™s Park Lane, recognise excellence and innovation in the UK and Irish card and payments industries.
This commendation recognises the performance of the TSYS Transaction Recovery Network (powered by Ethoca) and Ethoca Alerts â€“ a faster, more cost-effective and customer friendly alternative to the chargeback process. It provides an early warning on fraud and disputes that have already been confirmed between cardholders and their issuing bank, giving merchants the opportunity to stop fraud, halt the delivery of goods and services, and refund cardholders to avoid impending chargebacks. Card issuers who use the service benefit by avoiding chargeback processing costs and recovering fraud losses â€“ including 3D Secure and low-value transaction write-offs â€“ much more quickly and inexpensively than ever before.

"London's ClauseMatch and Singapore-based Ingenia partner to provide 'Compliance as a Service'
ClauseMatch, an award-winning London-based Regulatory Technology (RegTech) firm transforming polic...
This partnership has been formed to provide ""Compliance-as-a-Service"" for small and medium-sized financial institutions in Singapore bringing together Ingenia's consultancy services enhanced by the ClauseMatch RegTech solution.
This development comes along with Singapore and the UK signing three agreements in London on June 13that will boost collaboration in financial services including making a new agreement to enhance cooperation in data connectivity between the two financial centres.
Ingenia designs, advises on and maintains compliance frameworks for financial institutions who outsource their compliance function and in specific compliance support assignments. They assist in the challenging tasks of creating, supporting and running the compliance function for smaller financial institutions, including fund managers, external asset managers, and FinTech companies.
By adopting the ClauseMatch platform to create and maintain policies and procedures for their clients, they will be able to collaborate in real-time with their clients to conceive their policies and procedures, ensure that their clientsâ€™ policies and procedures are up to date, and easily share the framework with their clients. Ingenia currently has approximately 60 clients, among them 16 assignments for outsourced compliance and 9 for compliance assistance.
Rolf Haudenschild, Co-Founder, Head of Regulatory & Risk Services at Ingenia, commented: ""First and foremost, this partnership gives smaller financial institutions in Singapore and Asia much needed access to the advanced tools and capabilities for regulatory compliance. We are excited to be partnering with ClauseMatch, as their solution provides a simple yet powerful approach to tackling an issue central to regulated financial institutions - how to reduce the time, cost and complexity of dealing with regulations and core business documents.""
""At ClauseMatch, we see that financial institutions in Asia are starting to become much more attentive to innovations in the regulatory technology field. This partnership with Ingenia is a significant step for us both specifically in the investment management industry and as our first development in the South East Asia region. Ingenia's impressive network and close experience with local companies will play a crucial role in providing the market with innovative solutions"", - Arathi Arul, Head of sales for the SEA region mentioned.
RegTech indeed is gaining closer attention in Singapore and support from the Singapore government and industry associations this year. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has been investing in SupTech (supervision RegTech for financial regulators) and supporting innovations for compliance, while the Singapore FinTech Association has just launched a new RegTech Sub-Committee.
â€œCollaboration between Ingenia Consultants and ClauseMatch is a perfect example of what SFA RegTech Sub-Committee would like to promote going forward. The smart application of technologies to achieve better regulatory outcomes for smaller financial institutions shows that RegTech is quite essential in the current tough regulatory environment,"" says Mr. Chionh Chye Kit, Chair of SFA RegTech Sub-Committee.
""Monetary Authority of Singapore recognises the importance of regulatory technology which is signified by the agreement between the UK and SG governments on RegTech among other things. In the last few years London emerged as the leader in RegTech and the partnership with Ingenia will help local firms get access to best in class-leading tech in compliance,"" Evgeny Likhoded, CEO & Founder at ClauseMatch mentioned.
To recall, earlier, in March, ClauseMatch expanded into South East Asia out of Singapore. The company is currently working with several global financial institutions including Barclays and Revolut which have Singapore presence. However, the contract with Ingenia is the first one with a local entity in the region for ClauseMatch. It is now currently mastering the solution for the investment management industry having been selected as one of 10 finalists for the IMAS DAP accelerator in Singapore back in May.",2
"GFT partners with Digital Asset to resell DAML for Corda globally
LONDON, Oct. 20, 2020 /PRNewswire/ --
Growing demand for enterprise distributed ledger technology (DLT) for peer-to-peer information sharing
GFT is one of a select number of global reseller partners supporting 'DAML for Corda' *
GFT the go-to-firm for the financial services and insurance sectors
Increasing regulatory pressure is driving adoption
Clients will benefit from improved operational and risk mitigation capabilities
GFT, a global IT services and software engineering provider driving the digital transformation of the world's leading companies in financial services, insurance and manufacturing, announced today it has expanded its global partnership with Digital Asset to include DAML smart contract support for R3's Corda blockchain. GFT is one of a select number of resellers providing DAML for Corda enterprise support globally with the service from GFT being available immediately.
DAML for CordaÂ marries the power and simplicity ofÂ DAML, an open source smart contract language,Â with the flexibility and broad adoption of the built-for-businessÂ CordaÂ blockchain platform. ThisÂ offers a powerful way to deploy distributed, multi-party applications across all types of business domains. DAMLÂ for CordaÂ operates at a higher level of abstraction with built-in concepts of parties, rights, and obligations. With DAML, developers only need to focus on the business logic, leaving the low level execution and data distribution details to be automated by the DAML Driver.
David Creer, Innovation Consultant and Blockchain SME at GFTÂ said; ""As enterprise DLT finally comes of age, banks, start-ups and SMEs the world over, are now breaking new ground with distributed applications that promote new business models. Within the financial services industry specifically, increasing regulatory pressure has been instrumental in driving a growing demand and has further highlighted the urgent need for more versatile peer-to-peer information sharing capabilities. DAML for Corda provides this and a great deal more.""
Using DAML for Corda users can quickly and efficiently write CordApps in DAML, while realising significant cost savings and a faster time to market. DAML applications provide a robust framework to enable better management of transactional workflows, resulting in improved operational efficiency and risk mitigation capabilities. DAML also preserves privacy, trust and speed across any distributed ledger or database. This is particularly relevant to the capital markets and insurance sectors. Portability is also assured as clients are able to very easily move to another ledger without having to rewrite a single line of code.
CreerÂ continued; ""The continued reliance on legacyÂ infrastructures which has created increasingly unmanageable data silos and error-prone reconciliation processesÂ is not sustainable, particularly in the current economic climate. We strongly believe in the power of distributed ledgers and smart contracts to address these pressing needs, therefore GFT has made a significant investment in building a deep pool of DAML for Corda skills which are available across our business. We look forward to forging an even stronger partnership with the Digital Asset team and supporting many more firms to successfully implement this highly innovative and much needed solution.""
Yuval Rooz, CEO & Co-founder at Digital Asset commented; ""GFT brings many years of unique experience in building Corda networks and DAML driven applications. We are delighted to have expanded our longstanding and mutually supportive partnership to include DAML for Corda. We are confident that GFT's world-class customer support and technical expertise will help enterprises use DAML to unlock the power of Corda, without getting locked in.""
Marika Lulay, CEO at GFT concluded; ""Never before have firms been under as much pressure as they are today to deliver on their digital transformation objectives. We believe this extension of our partnership with Digital Asset adds another important dimension to our business and for our globally diverse client base. Being an integral part of the DAML for Corda initiative is a perfect example of our unrelenting commitment to being at the forefront of delivering positive change for our shared clients. We look forward to doing great things together with Digital Asset in the future.""
*A product that allows firms to integrate DAML smart contracts language with a Corda open source or Corda Enterprise DLT network.

"Revolut Partners With Mastercard as it Prepares to Compete with American Banks
Revolut, the British fintech firm that offers digital banking services, has announced a partnership with Mastercard () to facilitate the firmâ€™s U.S. market debut expected by the end of this year. According to the terms of the partnership, all of Revolutâ€™s debit cards issued in the U.S. during the initial phase along with at least [...] The post Revolut Partners With Mastercard as it Prepares to Compete with American Banks by Rohail Saleem appeared first on Wccftech.
Revolut, the British fintech firm that offers digital banking services, has announced a partnership with Mastercard (NYSE:MA) to facilitate the firmâ€™s U.S. market debut expected by the end of this year. According to the terms of the partnership, all of Revolutâ€™s debit cards issued in the U.S. during the initial phase along with at least 50 percent of the fintechâ€™s European cards will bear the Mastercard branding.
According to CNBC, Revolutâ€™s CEO Nikolay Storonsky said in a phone interview that Mastercard became the fintechâ€™s first choice due to that companyâ€™s â€œgreat tech and great infrastructure.â€
Revolut currently holds an EU banking license from Lithuaniaâ€™s central bank and the firm is expected to partner with an American bank as it prepares for a rollout of its services in the U.S. The startup is part of a growing repertoire of such businesses in Europe where customers benefit from polished digital banking apps accompanied by sleek-looking designer payment cards. Despite the absence of physical branches, payment-centered European businesses such as Revolut, Monzo and N26 have gained millions of users on a cumulative basis over the past couple of years. Nonetheless, Revolut remains the uncontested frontrunner in the sphere of digital banking apps and the firm aims to compete with established American banks in a wide gamut of banking services such as foreign exchange, current accounts, remittances, etc.
â€œWeâ€™re going to ensure our product is better value for customers, most U.S. banks charge $10 a month for an account and $10-$15 for local transfers and weâ€™ll be offering both for free,â€ Revolutâ€™s Nikolay Storonsky told Reuters.
This development comes as Revolut continues to enhance its ongoing collaboration with Mastercardâ€™s largest rival â€“ Visa (NYSE:V). The startup, in partnership with Visa, plans to enter 24 new markets and is looking to hire 3500 additional employees by the summer of 2020 to bolster its ongoing global expansion. Moreover, the firm expects Visa to eventually join its U.S. venture and predicts that at least 75 percent of all cards it issues outside of Europe in future will bear the Visa branding.
Revolut initiated its business in 2015 by providing prepaid debit cards and foreign exchange services at very competitive rates. Since then, the firm has expanded its portfolio of services and now offers business accounts as well as a facility to trade cryptocurrencies and equities. However, as is the case with many of its competitors, the startup has failed to earn an annual profit with the recent financial reports depicting a twofold increase in its annual losses to Â£32.8 million in 2018 from a loss of Â£14.8 million in 2017. Nonetheless, the digital banking firm continues to grow at a rapid pace and is currently adding, on average, between 800,000 and 900,000 new users per month.
The fintech space has been a venture capital magnet for some time now and, according to CB Insights, the sector attracted $649 million in fresh funding for 17 projects in the second quarter of 2019. According to Sky news, Revolut is also looking to tap another VC-based funding round later this year to raise at least $1.5 billion which, in turn, would value the firm at between $5 billion and $10 billion.
While European startups like Revolut, N26, and Monzo have proven their ability to generate prolific growth, questions remain as to whether these businesses possess the ability to transform their meteoric growth into a profitable and sustainable business model.",2

"FinTech Company ENACOMM Strikes Partnership with Leader in Biometric and AI Technology IDmission
[ACCESSWIRE]
TULSA, OK / ACCESSWIRE / March 24, 2021 / Banks, credit unions, credit card and payments companies of all sizes are now able to take advantage of the most modern identity solutions available, thanks to a new partnership between FinTech enablement company ENACOMM and IDmission, a global leader in biometric and AI technology providing end-to-end digital transformations for applications relying on ID and identity verifications. ENACOMM customers will have the opportunity to streamline the onboarding process and boost customer acquisition using IDmission's convenient yet secure authentication technologies, which is crucial in today's age, when fewer consumers are visiting branches in-person, opting for digital processes amidst the pandemic.
With features like true passive liveness, deduplication, identity-proofing-as-a-service, and enhanced biometric Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), IDmission solutions help businesses prevent fraud, identify and monitor threats for Know Your Customer (KYC) compliance, and enable frictionless customer experiences. IDmission solutions also determine document authenticity, match selfies to document(s), and even reduce racial bias through AI.
""Remote, digital transactions skyrocketed amidst the pandemic, and so did fraud, making the need for fast, secure authentication of customers more important than ever,"" commented IDmission CEO Ashim Banerjee. ""Biometric technology has become significantly more reliable in recent years, earning it an indispensable role in the Multi-Factor Authentication process.""
According to Feedzai's recently released Financial Crime report, there was a 650% increase worldwide in Account Take Over (ATO) scams from Q4 2020 compared to Q1 2020. In an ATO attack, fraudsters use the credentials, account information, and passwords of legitimate users to gain unauthorized access to their accounts, then they transfer funds to another account or make purchases with the stolen credentials.

"Malaysian tech company partnering with well-funded Cincinnati startup
CodeZero, a tech company based Malaysia, is collaborating with Over-the-Rhineâ€™s Lisnr to power â€œZero,â€ a digital version of the standard business card.
A Southeast Asian company is collaborating with one of Cincinnatiâ€™s best-known startups to help it power a new futuristic digitial identity card.
CodeZero, a tech company based Malaysia, is collaborating with Over-the-Rhineâ€™s Lisnr to power â€œZero,â€ a digital version of the standard business card. CodeZero is using Lisnrâ€™s ultrasonic technology, which allows for the transfer of data between devices using sound, to combat digital identity spoofing and enable contactless authentication, it said in a release.
CodeZeroâ€™s product â€œpushes the envelopeâ€ on what a business card should be, the company said. Using CodeZeroâ€™s portal, for example, a employee can be onboarded and assigned their own digital business card in a matter of a few clicks, and a company can upload, design and digitize their corporate profile, brochures or sales kit â€“ saving time, cost and the environment.
CodeZero had failed in its previous search for an ultrasonic solution â€“ digital identity fraudÂ is a growing problem, it said â€“ and had reverted to using a QR code. Lisnrâ€™s technology allows for a safe and seamless data transfer and authentication medium. The two companies first announced the partnership in December.
â€œThe pandemic accelerated the speed of our adoption, and this brings a whole new host of challenges, one of which is the integrity and authenticity of an individualâ€™s digital identity,â€ CodeZero CEO Steve Koh said in the release. â€œOnly by addressing this issue can we move forward, and with this collaboration with Lisnr, we believe we are headed in the right direction.â€
Lisnr has an active customer base across the globe, including Africa, Asia and Europe. Founded in 2012, the company employs 15 locally with offices in Over-the-Rhine and Oakland, Calif. Itâ€™s considered one of Greater Cincinnatiâ€™s most well-funded startups, with more than $40 million raised from major investors like Visa, Intel, Jump Capital, NTT DOCOMO Ventures, Mercury Fund, R/GA and Synchrony Financial.",4

"PhonePe partners Bajaj Allianz for hospitalisation insurance policy for COVID-19
Flipkart-owned PhonePe on Wednesday said it has launched a coronavirus hospitalisation insurance policy called 'Corona Care' in partnership with Bajaj Allianz General Insurance.
The policy is priced at Rs 156 with an insurance cover of Rs 50,000 for a person aged under 55 years, and the cover is applicable at any hospital offering coronavirus treatment, a statement said.
It also covers 30 days of expenses related to pre-hospitalisation costs and post-care medical treatment, it added.
Users can purchase the policy from the PhonePe app, and the customer is issued policy documents within the app, it said.
""The Indian government has taken very bold steps towards containing the outbreak in India. However, many Indians don't have health insurance covers, so they will be faced with an added financial burden in case someone in their family needs to get hospitalisation treatment for COVID-19,"" PhonePe founder and CEO Sameer Nigam said.
He added that PhonePe has decided to forego its commission, thus enabling an affordable product with Bajaj Allianz General Insurance.

If all Adzooma users participate in the cashback offer, they will collectively save an incredible Â£2,265,000 a year in ad spend alone. In addition to that, all users who sign up to Revolut Business through Adzooma will be able to access all the regular perks that a Revolut Business account offers, including free international payments, smart business cards, accounting integrations and much more.
Adzooma and Revolutâ€™s successful partnership began in April this year, bringing collaborative benefits to all users, and enabling customers to generate a more effective online strategy for their business through the Adzooma platform.
Antonio Lopes, Growth Partnerships Manager Revolut Business said: â€œIn our pursuit to help businesses manage their finances safely online, weâ€™re proud that business owners trust Revolut Business with their online spend, especially with advertising. Together with Adzooma, we thought of leveraging the security, transparency and control of our cards with the smartest advertising platform in the UK to create an increasingly beneficial value proposition for online businesses across the globe.
â€œWeâ€™re super excited to be launching this partnership with Adzooma - building upon their already stellar product and helping businesses further optimise how they go about managing their ad spend.â€
Adzoomaâ€™s software is a proprietary solution that provides one-click optimisations, custom automation and white-label reporting in one simple interface, eliminating the need for additional resource time and providing real-time data on all marketing activity.

"Goldman Sachs' Marcus branches further into US SMB lending through C2FO partnership
Goldman Sachs' direct bank Marcus is deepening its involvement in lending to US small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) through a newÂ partnership with working capital platform C2FO.
Marcus will start offering loans to C2FO users this summer, with amounts ranging from $10,000 to $1 million and coupled with fixed interest ratesâ€”borrowers' creditworthiness and financial needs will be underwriting factors.
Additionally, Marcus will not require borrowers to have assets designated as collateral, removing what has historically been an obstacle for some SMBs. The partnership is intended to offer a fast review process, with loan term offers generated in minutes and lending decisions given in two business days.
Marcus' collaboration with C2FO is the latest among the direct bank's SMB lending partnerships, following deals it struck over the past year with retail giants to lend to their sellers.
Amazon:Â The direct bankÂ partneredÂ with the etailer last June to make lines of credit available to thousands of platform sellers in amounts of up to $1 million, with interest rates ranging from 6.99% to 20.99%.
Walmart:Â Goldman followed up in September withÂ a dealÂ that allows Marcus to offer lines of credit to the retailer's Marketplace sellers in amounts between $10,000 and $75,000, with the future possibility of raising the figure as high as $1 million. The Walmart partnership includes the same interest rates as the Amazon deal.
The direct bank's C2FO partnership lets it grow its business banking operations by branching out from retail sellers to working capital applicants.Â By adding another partnership, Marcus is boosting the breadth of its US SMB lending activities, which could be beneficial for its bottom line.
We've recently seen the benefits of increased SMB lending activity illustrated by OakNorth, a business-focused, UK-based neobank that isÂ planningÂ a US entry: Its 2020 pretax profitÂ jumpedÂ by 18% compared with 2019, and its deposits climbed by 15% over the same period. Marcus could take another page from OakNorth's profitable playbook by adding depository accounts geared to SMBs, which would allow it to build a source of cheap funding to bolster its future lending.

"Australian Securities Exchange Debuts Infrastructure Replacement as Blockchain Switch Begins
Phased implementation begins for joint platform built by ASX and Digital Asset Holdings
The exchange plans to complete the rollout of its new platform in partnership with Digital Asset Holdings by 2020.
Phased implementation begins for joint platform built by ASX and Digital Asset Holdings 
The Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) has released the first code for its replacement app development tool based on blockchain, the company confirmed in a press release on May 7.
The new platform, dubbed the Customer Development Environment (CDE), builds on the exchangeâ€™s previous offering, Chess, which will now be retired.
The initial features, which hinge on distributed-ledger technology (DLT), began a rollout at the end of April, with ASX drip-feeding more to users in roughly two-month intervals before the platform is fully live next year.
The scheme is a joint partnership with Digital Asset Holdings, the United States-based DLT firm formerly chaired by Blythe Masters.
â€œWe know our progress is being watched internationally and is an important bellwether for the technology's adoption,â€ Peter Hiom, ASXâ€™s deputy CEO, commented in the press release. He continued:
â€œIt represents the first time market participants anywhere in the world can experience the benefits of â€˜taking a nodeâ€™ and establishing direct connectivity to a golden source record of real-time data via distributed ledger technology.â€
Chess, developed in the 1990s, forms critical infrastructure for ASX, which uses it to handle operations such as clearing, settlement and asset registration.
In addition to DLT, the new CDE will also make use of smart contracts via DAML, an open source language developed by Digital Asset.
â€œWith the delivery of the CDE, ASX customers get their first glimpse of what the new CHESS system can provide,â€ Digital Assetâ€™s new chief executive, Yuval Rooz, added.
As Cointelegraph reported, the original plan was to launch CDE last year, with ASX opting for a delay in order to conduct further testing.",2

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--tZERO announced today that it has entered a partnership with the producers of the upcoming movie, â€œAtari: Fistful of Quarters,â€ to tokenize the first major theatrical motion picture. This will be the first time the film industry leverages the power of blockchain technology, marking yet another milestone towards tZEROâ€™s goal to revolutionizing capital markets. tZERO will develop the Bushnell token, sold by the film production and financing company, Vision Tree.
â€œIt has been a long process to find the right partner to tokenize the Atari movie and to blaze a new trail for other media projects to follow. After looking closely at every major company in the space, we are thrilled to collaborate with tZERO on this exciting endeavor.â€
The new biopic is centered on a pioneering figure in the video game industry, Nolan Bushnell, who went from repairing broken pinball machines to launching the videogame manufacturer Atari in the 1970s. The filmâ€™s unique approach to funding is reflective of Bushnellâ€™s groundbreaking and innovative career. The movie is being produced by Leonardo DiCaprioâ€™s production company, Appian Way, as well as Benjamin Gerry and J.D. Seraphine of Vision Tree.
tZERO CEO Saum Noursalehi said, â€œOur goal is to apply blockchain technology to capital markets and every industry that can benefit from the platform we have built. The Atari movie is the perfect project to lead the way for the tokenization of the movie business.â€
Patrick M. Byrne, Director & Chief Executive Officer of tZEROâ€™s parent company, Overstock.com, (NASDAQ:OSTK) added, ""We have been looking for the team to crack the code for Hollywood and bring much needed transparency and accountability to an industry that has been historically resistant to change. This is an extremely impressive team and we are thrilled to bring the tZERO tech stack to the movie industry.â€
Vision Tree announced in March 2018 that it planned to raise as much as $40 million with the sale of the Bushnell token. Bushnell token owners, in addition to receiving shares of movie earnings, also play an interactive role in the filmâ€™s development. Token owners have received additional benefits such as being able to vote on the movieâ€™s trailer and even have a say in choosing the movie cast.
J.D. Seraphine, founder of Vision Tree said, â€œOnce we had the opportunity to connect with Patrick, Saum, and the rest of the tZERO family it became immediately clear that this is the best team to roll out the token for the Atari movie.â€
Benjamin Gerry, founder of Vision Tree, added, â€œIt has been a long process to find the right partner to tokenize the Atari movie and to blaze a new trail for other media projects to follow. After looking closely at every major company in the space, we are thrilled to collaborate with tZERO on this exciting endeavor.â€

"Cloudflare aims for scale with A/NZ Exclusive Networks deal
Cloudflare hopes to scale up its activities in the local market thanks to a new agreement with cyber security distribution specialist Exclusive Networks.
Cloudflare hopes to scale up its activities in the local market thanks to a new agreement with cyber security distribution specialist Exclusive Networks.
The deal, which specifically covers Australia and New Zealand (A/NZ), marks the web infrastructure and website security vendorâ€™s first such agreement with a distributor in the local A/NZ marketplace, although it does have an existing agreement in place with a distributor in Asia.
While Cloudflare has worked with partners in A/NZ for a number of years, the partnership with Exclusive Networks forms part of the company's global channel strategy and continued expansion into Australia and New Zealand.
Indeed, the deal is expected to see the vendor ramp up its partner relationships and exposure in the local market from a â€œfew dozenâ€ to hundreds, perhaps thousands, according to Cloudflare A/NZ head Raymond Maisano, who came across from VMware to lead the company in the local market in 2019.
This kind of step-change in exposure to the local partner community was previously hard to come by, with Maisano pointing out that itâ€™s tricky for a vendor to scale if itâ€™s doing all the legwork on its own.
â€œMy biggest challenge last year was just having enough people to cover the demand,â€ Maisano told ARN. This agreement makes that easier and gives us the ability to scale.
â€œThereâ€™s only so many customers you can speak to at any one time. A real challenge is coverage. How do we get to so many customers? How to we understand their individual environments to protect them quickly?
â€œBut here we have a value-added distributor who is really focused on helping to align the right partners with the right customers. Not every customer is in the same circumstance. For us, it allows us to scale much faster,â€ he added.
Broadly, the Exclusive Networks deal represents a maturing of the Cloudflareâ€™s go-to-market approach globally, with the company looking to develop the â€œrightâ€ relationships to help it meet the needs of the countries in which it is expanding.
â€œAs we continue to expand our presence in Australia and New Zealand, partnering with specialised distributors will help us seamlessly support more market segments,â€ Maisano said.
â€œLocal partnerships complement the global scalability of our network and will be key in expanding our operations to serve joint customers in the region and their users worldwide,â€ he added.
For Exclusive Networks Pacific managing director Jonathan Odria, the agreement comes at a time when solutions by the likes of Cloudflare are becoming increasingly paramount.
â€œWith services previously run in data centres now running on the internet, Cloudflare is well positioned to secure this whole new perimeter,â€ Odria said. â€œForming a partnership with Cloudflare whose global expertise in ensuring company resources are secure, performant and reliable, is a welcome addition to Exclusive Networksâ€™ A/NZ market.
""Itâ€™s a good win for us, weâ€™re seeing a lot of members moving to cloud-based software-as-a-service solutions, and Cloudflare started in that space from the beginning,"" he added.",0

Marketing analytics and attribution specialist integrates with leading app commerce software platform to help retailers unlock the power of mobile campaign data
Native SaaS retail mobile app platform,Â Poq, announces the beta launch of its standard integration with mobile analytics and attribution provider, AppsFlyer.
The integration is the result of a partnership between the two companies that will enable Poq mobile app clients to rapidly scale their app commerce marketing efforts and drive more effective customer acquisition and retention campaigns for their apps.
Marketing Technology News: SpotX Announces Support for Unified ID 2.0 Solution
Developing, delivering and measuring app marketing campaigns can be challenging for retailers, where visibility of downloads and in-app interactivity attribution is limited. In addition, the ability to â€˜deep linkâ€™ customers straight back into the app from any channel can be resource-intensive to maintain.
By integrating the AppsFlyer software development kit (SDK) onto the Poq platform, joint clients will gain greater insights into how their mobile apps are performing and driving growth, in comparison to other channels such as mobile web. Beyond measurement and attribution, the AppsFlyer platform is able to offer clients a number of other valuable features, such as ad fraud protection, audience management and uninstall attribution measurement.
Poqâ€™s partnership with AppsFlyer comes at a vital time for retailers, where app shopping growth isÂ forecast to outstrip web-based channelsÂ as a result of an accelerated shift to digital in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. It also comes as Poq released a number of complimentary ad-tech solutions last year that have allowed its clients to effectively run customer acquisition and retention campaigns on Apple Search Ads, Google App Campaigns and Facebook.
This standard platform integration will enable all Poq customers to use the AppsFlyer deep-linking solution (OneLink) and its Smart Banner Feature, as well as kickstart attribution campaigns. As retail mobile app marketing strategies develop in sophistication, Poq customers will also have the ability to add paid-for additional features to their pricing plan at any time.

Sheenu Aggarwal, App Marketing Specialist, Poq said: â€œAppsFlyer is a great partner and, like Poq, has proven success with a number of retailers globally. So, this partnership presents our clients with a massive opportunity to really grow their app commerce business and accurately attribute that success to their apps. The partnership weâ€™re launching is vital for integrating what are becoming increasingly lucrative apps into the overall digital mix and optimising the customer journey for our retailers.â€
Russell Burden, Director of Partner Development, AppsFlyer added: With the retail industry changing rapidly, itâ€™s never been more important for marketers to have the tools and data needed to make accurate, better-informed strategic decisions around their mobile marketing campaigns. Through this partnership, weâ€™re able to offer just that, giving retailers the opportunity to quickly and easily get up and running with mobile marketing campaigns, attribution measurement and other insights.â€

"Kentik and Cloudflare Partner to Mitigate Advanced DDoS Attacks
SAN FRANCISCO, May 6, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- KentikÂ®, provider of the only AIOps platform specifically for network professionals, today announced a partnership with Cloudflare, Inc.

"Revolut to launch in the US with Mastercard deal
Digital banking app Revolut is set to begin issuing its cards in the US by the end of this year via a partnership with payments company Mastercard, the two companies said today.
Digital banking app Revolut is set to begin issuing its cards in the US by the end of this year via a partnership with payments company Mastercard, the two companies said today.
The announcement follows a similar deal last month where Mastercard rival Visa partnered with Revolut as part of its global expansion plans.
Revolut, one of the world's fastest-growing bank account providers, aims to undercut established players such as Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase on everything from foreign exchange to current accounts and remittances.
""We're going to ensure our product is better value for customers, most US banks charge $10 a month for an account and $10-$15 for local transfers and we'll be offering both for free,"" Revolut chief executive and founder Nikolay Storonsky said.
""Today's announcement confirms the two businesses will partner on a minimum of 50% of all existing and future cards Revolut issue in Europe,"" the two companies said.
Revolut's deal with Mastercard will allow it to plug into its networks so that Revolut cards will be accepted by merchants in the 210 countries where Mastercard operates.
The British-based banking app aims to hire around 3,500 staff in the next year as it moves into North America and Asia, bringing its total employees to around 5,000.
Fintech firms such as Revolut, Monzo, and Starling have grown rapidly in Britain by undercutting traditional banks' prices while offering generally slicker service, but they face a challenge to build sustainable profits.
Most make their money from charging a subset of users for premium features, rather than lending money out as traditional banks do.
Revolut may also face a greater challenge in the US market, where customers' wallets already bulge with multiple cards and local fintech firms such as Robinhood have a head start in offering fee-free stockbroking, one of Revolut's selling points.
Revolut differs from mainstream banks in that customers' deposits are not directly protected by government guarantees, but held in segregated accounts at traditional lenders.
While customers have therefore been slow to entrust their savings to Revolut since its launch in 2015, some 8 million customers have signed up for an account, attracted by its slick app and rock-bottom foreign exchange rates.",2

Cybereason, Oracle announce strategic partnership
Oracle and cybersecurity vendor Cybereason have engaged into a strategic alliance which will see Cybereason adopt the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure [OCI] as its preferred platform to power the Cybereason Defense Platform.
â€œThis is a joint offering for companies looking to transition to the cloud, where the challenge is how to connect the dots afterwards,â€ said Yonatan Striem-Amit, Cybereasonâ€™s CTO. â€œWith Oracleâ€™s security approach with cloud, and us being able to connect the dots, it becomes a very compelling offer for cloud migration that is unique in the market. Itâ€™s an option for customers and partners that was not available to them before.â€
Cybereason is headquartered in Boston, but their pedigree is in the Israeli Defense Forceâ€™s cybersecurity efforts, and they have been in business since 2012 making what would become known as an EDR [Extended Detection and Response] offering. They recently announced their expansion into the XDR space. They emphasize that their differentiation from other vendors who have entered the space in the last year is that their commitment to openness, rather than focusing on making it work as part of a broader platform, makes them more operationally efficient, increasing visibility and detection rate. Cybereason claims a ratio of one analyst to 200,000 endpoints, and a very high detection and response efficiency of 93%.
Striem-Amit said that the integration for the Oracle OCI, in which the companies have architected a solution to migrate and secure endpoints, optimizes their threat prevention and detection for that platform, and fits with Oracleâ€™s strategy of partnering with best of breed players.
â€œOracle has been pushing OCI very aggressively, and as part of that they decided they wanted to partner with more security-minded partners,â€ he said. â€œOracle has put a lot of focus on creating security centres within the cloud with partnerships like this. They evaluated all the major endpoint security people out there, and decided that we best fit their vision for their customers. We did something similar, and discovered that OCI is a very security-focused cloud, and that they are differentiating it as security first.â€
Striem-Amit said that OCI is particularly strong on data sovereignty.
â€œData sovereignty applies more with global companies because it has many more issues that are applicable to them,â€ he indicated. â€œItâ€™s important that a solution be aware of geographies and how to deal with localized laws. We believe this will be more critical as time progresses and we are well suited for that. For partners it gives more options around who owns the data, and the ability to offer customers control of locality.â€
While OCI is Cybereasonâ€™s preferred cloud, Striem-Amit emphasized that they are still giving full support to all the others.
â€œWe are not going away from the other clouds,â€ he said. â€œWe are just strongly endorsing Oracles cloud.â€
The two companies have an aggressive joint marketing strategy planned.
â€œWe are working together with them to introduce each other to our customers,â€ Striem-Amit noted. â€œWe had a couple of joint customers before the partnership. We are working with our own sales teams and partners and Oracleâ€™s to bring this to the market.â€
Part of this also involves explaining the security advantages of OCI to their partners, many of whom are less familiar with it. Cybereason doesnâ€™t sell direct, and their partners have been their entire route to market.
â€œMost of our partners are really security focused, and this is a great add-on to improve security,â€ Striem-Amit indicated.
Strategic alliances are an important part of Cybereasonâ€™s Go-to-Market, but they see the Oracle one as distinct for them.
â€œWe have strategic planning with others, but we think they will be a unique one in terms of what they provide and access to the market,â€ Striem-Amit said. â€œEverything is unique, and there is a strong match around the culture and the passion.â€
The integrated solution is available through both Cybereason and the Oracle Cloud Marketplace.",4

airBaltic Expands Its List Of Accepted Cryptocurrencies
European airline airBaltic has expanded its list of accepted cryptocurrencies to include many more types. Now included are popular cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Binance USD, as well as the more unusual such as Dogecoin. airBaltic was the first airline in the world to accept payments in Bitcoin and continues to lead the revolution in the travel industry.
airBaltic leads the cryptocurrency revolution
Back in 2014, airBaltic became the first airline in the world to accept payments made in Bitcoin. A handful of other airlines and travel providers have followed suit, but cryptocurrency remains a rarity for most passengersâ€™ payment options. Those that do accept it tend to focus solely on Bitcoin, but of course, there are many other cryptocurrencies out there.
Thanks to its partnership with BitPay, airBaltic is now extending the range of cryptocurrencies it is able to accept. The company already accepted Bitcoin as a payment method, but now that has been expanded to include Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Dogecoin and four USD-pegged stablecoins â€“ Gemini dollar, USD Coin, Paxos Standard Token and Binance USD.
The airlineâ€™s CEO Martin Gauss commented on the expansion of its cryptocurrency offerings, saying,
â€œAs an innovative airline, we always strive to search for ways to improve the customer experience starting from the booking process. Over the years around 1000 clients have used the payment option, which may not seem like a lot, but still offers passengers a unique payment option hard to find elsewhere.â€
As with the current crypto payment system, airBaltic customers will be able to see the ticket price displayed in Euros. When the customer pays for their flight, the fare is converted into the rate for that cryptocurrency at the time, and paid for in Euros. BitPay does the conversion, and no cryptocurrency is held by airBaltic.
Why pay for airfares in cryptocurrency?
For passengers, there are several benefits to paying for travel-related expenses with cryptocurrency. For a start, it removes bank fees usually associated with paying in foreign currencies, which can inflate travel costs significantly. It also allows a certain degree of anonymity, likely one of the reasons PrivateFly sees so much of its business paid for in Bitcoin. Overall, itâ€™s a more secure, rapid and self-reliant way of conducting business.
For airlines, airports and travel companies, offering payments in as many methods as possible is a desirable approach. They want to make it easy for the customer. However, the downside of accepting crypto as a payment method is in its wild and frequent value fluctuations.
The wild ride of Bitcoinâ€™s valuation has been well-publicized, and the rather unusual Dogecoin seems to increase in value every time Elon Musk tweets about it. If an airline holds crypto, the risk is that it will devalue significantly between the point of taking the payment and the time when itâ€™s converted into its own currency.",4
"Comcast & NBCUniversal invest in fintech app Acorns with a deal to produce content through CNBC
NBCUniversal, which is now Acorns' biggest shareholder, will also receive a seat on the start-up's...
NBCUniversal and the venture arm of Comcast are making an equity investment in financial technology start-up Acorns, which is now valued at $860 million.
The savings and investing app, which describes itself as a ""financial wellness system,"" will partner with CNBC to produce original content aimed at financial literacy.
""We have an imperative to educate people and make them smarter with their money so that they can make the right financial decisions,"" Acorns CEO Noah Kerner says.
CNBC.com
NBCUniversal and Comcast Ventures are taking a bet on millennial-focused financial technology app, Acorns.
The companies announced an equity investment in the start-up on Monday that includes a strategic partnership with Comcast-owned CNBC to produce original content with Acorns. The two will team up on articles, videos and eventually live conferences with the aim of increasing financial literacy, the companies said.
The investment was part of Acorns' latest $105 million funding round, which puts its valuation at $860 million. BlackRock, Bain Capital Ventures, TPG's Rise Fund, DST and Michael Dell's MSD Capital also took part in the Series E round. NBCUniversal, which is now Acorns' biggest shareholder, will also receive a seat on the start-up's board. It will be filled by CNBC Chairman Mark Hoffman.
""This partnership with Acorns builds on CNBC's 30-year commitment to democratizing the financial markets helping generations invest for their future,"" Hoffman said in a statement. ""We are excited to bring together two brands with this shared social purpose to drive value to our viewers, users and customers.""
The Irvine, California-based start-up tries to facilitate smart investing by consumers through various services and education offerings. One of its most popular offerings allows customers to automatically invest the spare change from debit or credit card purchases. For example, if an Acorns user bought a cup of coffee for $2.75, the mobile app would round up to the nearest dollar and put that remaining 25 cents into an Acorns investment account. That money is then put to work in professionally managed index funds.
Its automated retirement account service ""Acorns Later"" has ushered in 350,000 investors who have invested $40 million to date, according to the company.
The 6-year-old start-up already produces its own educational content through its site ""."" CNBC is bringing on a team of about 20 people to expand that effort, which Acorns CEO Noah Kerner said will ""take things to the next level"" and get useful investing content in front of its 4.5 million customers.
""We're trying to put the tools of wealth-making in everyone's hands,"" Kerner told CNBC. ""We have an imperative to educate people and make them smarter with their money so that they can make the right financial decisions.""
Kerner told CNBC the cash injection should help the start-up expand its product offering and team. Its last publicly disclosed deal was a $50 million investment from BlackRock and inside capital in May, according to Pitchbook. In addition to Monday's investment from NBCUniversal and Comcast Ventures, the venture capital arm of NBCUniversal's parent company, Acorns has also attracted minority investments from PayPal Holdings and Greycroft, among others, according to Pitchbook.
A key opportunity, Kerner said, is to educate people right when they go to make a financial decision. A relevant video or article on investing, produced by CNBC, may spring up on the Acorns app as a user goes to try a new product.
""We want to educate at the moment of decision-making and have that knowledge right there in the product,"" Kerner said. ""That education should happen side by side.""
He describes Acorns as a ""financial wellness system,"" instead of an investing, savings or fintech app. Other automated investing and trading start-ups like Wealthfront, Betterment and Robinhood have made major inroads in the past decade. Their popularity has been linked to the rise of mobile phones, low-cost technology that makes them leaner than Wall Street incumbents and a lingering distrust in traditional banking after the financial crisis.
The average Acorns customer is around 32 years old with an income of $50,000 to $60,000. The CNBC partnership is designed to reach an ""up-and-coming"" financial audience that is younger or less financially savvy.
""This is all about broadening access,"" Kerner said. ""We think it's a good move to work with a company that's been democratizing investing for generations.""

"Paysafe Group announces partnership with PokerStars
(The Paypers) Paysafe Group has partnered with PokerStars, the poker brand of The Stars Group, to roll out Paysafeâ€™s Rapid Transfer payment solution in ten European countries.
Tuesday 16 July 2019 | 02:15 PMCET
Paysafe Group has partnered with PokerStars, the poker brand of The Stars Group, to roll out Paysafeâ€™s Rapid Transfer payment solution in ten European countries.
Registered customers of the online poker site in these countries now have the option to use Rapid Transfer to make deposits using their online banking details. Rapid Transfer allows consumers to make online payments instantly from their bank account, without leaving an operator or merchantâ€™s website. Users receive instant confirmation of payment.
PokerStarsâ€™ implementation of Rapid Transfer extends its deployment of deposit methods from Paysafe, which already include its digital payment solutions Skrill, NETELLER, and prepaid method paysafecard.
The importance of having secondary payment options is backed up by industry research carried out by Paysafe in 2018 amongst online businesses in the US, the UK, Canada, Germany, and Austria, where 26% reported that they think that a lack of available payment options on their website is a reason for abandoned transactions.
Earlier in 2019, Skrill, an e-wallet provider and part of Paysafe Group, has announced a partnership with ZenSports, a mobile P2P sports-betting marketplace. For more information about Paysafe, please check out a detailed profile of this company in our dedicated, industry-specific online company database.

Cigna, Oscar to offer small business plans in three states
Health insurers Oscar Health and Cigna Corp. said Tuesday they plan to offer co-branded, small business insurance coverage in Atlanta, San Francisco and four cities in Tennessee starting in the fourth quarter of this year.
The plans will include certain benefits that are featured in other Oscar plans, such as a concierge team, including a nurse, to help members navigate their coverage and set up doctor's appointments. Members will also have access to telemedicine at no cost and some will benefit from $3 prescriptions drug co-payments. The plans primarily will be available to companies with 50 or fewer employees but will be offered to companies with up to 100 workers in some states.
While Oscar has built its individual business segment around narrow provider networks, the new small group plans will allow customers the choice of either Cigna's broad national network or a local, narrower Cigna network.
""For Oscar, in a partner like Cigna, we get an experienced and seasoned insurance partner and with that, those deep and rich relationships they've built over time with providers on the medical and behavioral health side,"" said Chelsea Cooper, vice president of small group business at Oscar.
Historically, Cigna hasn't focused on the small group market. Most of its membership comes from large employers that contract with the insurer to administer health benefits and process claims. According to Cigna's most recent quarterly financial report, its small business membership totaled just 1,000 enrollees. Its total membership was 17.2 million as of March 31.
Oscar and Cigna first announced their partnership in January. Since then, COVID-19 pandemic has prompted an economic downturn that has threatened the viability of hundreds of thousands of small businesses across the country. A recent survey by researchers at various universities showed that 41% of small businesses temporarily closed and almost 2% permanently shut their doors amid the pandemic. Some have sought to cut costs through layoffs.
Cooper said Cigna and Oscar's research shows that while small businesses are hurting, small business owners still want to offer their employees coverage while being mindful of costs. Businesses with 50 full-time workers or less are not required to offer health coverage under the Affordable Care Act.
According to a survey of about 1,000 small businesses that the insurers commissioned, 70% of the small businesses with 50 employees or less had seen a decline in revenue and a little more than half laid off or furloughed workers. About 66% said providing health insurance to employees is a higher priority in their budgets as a result of COVID-19.
Few of Oscar's current small business customers have pulled the plug on health insurance for their workers, Cooper said. Oscar provides small group coverage to 17,000 members as of June. Since January, its small group enrollment has decreased a ""relatively immaterial"" amount, according to Cooper.
""They want to offer coverage, offer coverage that's affordable, and they also want to offer coverage where they are getting more value for their employees,"" she said.
Cooper declined to disclose the cost of the Cigna-Oscar small group coverage and how it compares with competitors' prices, because the plans have not yet received regulatory approval.
In Tennessee, the Cigna-Oscar plans will be available in Chattanooga, Knoxville, Memphis and Nashville. Because Oscar sells Oscar-only small business plans in Nashville already, Cooper said the company plans to stop selling those and encourage its clients to move over to the Cigna-Oscar plans.
Oscar in 2017 struck up a partnership with Humana to sell coverage to small business plans in Nashville, but that partnership is no longer in effect.",0
"TBI Bank partners Onfido to add to onboarding process
Bulgaria-based TBI Bank a phygital lender, has announced its partnership with Onfido, a global identity verification and authentication provider.
Tuesday 16 February 2021 12:15 CET | News
Bulgaria-based TBI Bank a phygital lender, has announced its partnership with Onfido, a global identity verification and authentication provider.
The partnership will help TBI Bank to make its onboarding process more secure. Before partnering with Onfido, the onboarding was achieved with live video calls with an agent, a process that was time consuming and sometimes inconvenient.
By integrating Onfidoâ€™s AI-powered ID verification service, TBIâ€™s customers can sign up by taking a photo of their government-issued identity document (ID) and taking a selfie. Onfido first checks that the ID is genuine and then matches it to the userâ€™s face. This ensures the person presenting the identity is its legitimate owner and is physically present.

"Ascent and IBM Integrate AI RegTech Solutions to Help Financial Institutions Streamline their Compliance Operations
Chicago and Armonk, NY: July 15, 2020 â€“ Ascent, a provider of AI-based solutions that automate regulatory compliance processes, and IBM today announced a partnership to integrate their respective RegTech solutions in an effort to help banks and other financial institutions better manage their growing and ever-changing regulatory requirements.
Specifically, IBM is integrating the Ascent branded regulatory knowledge platform from Ascent into its IBM OpenPages with Watson solution, to help clients leverage Ascentâ€™s automatically-generated register of regulation and rule changes that pertain specifically to the customer.
The integrated solution is designed to help regulated businesses keep better pace with todayâ€™s rapidly changing regulatory environment and help lower risk for potential fines and other supervisory actions. In addition, customers can benefit from the combined dynamic workflow capabilities and near real-time market intelligence by reducing the manual effort and time spent in transferring regulatory information between teams and disparate systems.
The IBM and Ascent partnership was the direct result of Ascentâ€™s successful proof of concept engagement with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), earlier this year, wherein IBM was also a key technology partner. The companies combined the Ascent platform with OpenPages with Watson which leveraged natural language processing and AI algorithms to identify and analyze more than 1.5 million paragraphs of regulatory text from the countryâ€™s Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II. The solution allowed CBA to quickly identify terms in the regulation that they needed to review and act upon â€“ a process that would have taken days of manual scanning.
â€œThe potential of this technology for the Bank and the financial services industry more broadly is exciting,â€ said Jasper Poos, Head of Governance and Assurance at Commonwealth Bank of Australia commented. â€œBy digitising parts of the regulatory change process, and the automation of continuously refreshing data we can improve the application of regulation, efficiency for our business as well as provide greater transparency with regulators. Itâ€™s been rewarding to collaborate with our RegTech and technology partners on a project that will have such a large, positive impact for our industry.â€
â€œAI for business is only as good as the ecosystem around it. And our collaboration with Ascent on the CBA solution is a great example of bringing innovative technologies together with purpose to help solve a growing challenge,â€ said David Marmer, Vice President, Offering Management, IBM RegTech. â€œRegulation can be complex, time consuming and costly. But with the application of AI and dynamically updated rules changes, companies are positioned to begin to operate and advance within those parameters quickly and easily.â€
â€œWe are pleased to launch this joint initiative with one of the worldâ€™s leading technology companies,â€ said Brian Clark, Ascent Founder & CEO. â€œAscent is designed to work with OpenPages and other enterprise systems in a powerful and complementary way. Ascentâ€™s ability to map obligations and regulatory changes targeted to the customer is a powerful workflow trigger for GRCs. We are excited about the implications it will have for our clients in financial services and look forward to helping them dramatically reduce regulatory risks and costs going forward.â€
Ascent has been rapidly gaining momentum since its founding in 2015. Since its inception, Ascent has grown 100% YOY, secured $26.7M in funding, and expanded to 50 full-time employees.
About Ascent
Ascent was founded in 2015 to help financial services firms automate the most tedious and error-prone aspects of compliance. With customers from Tier 1 and Tier 2 banks and other financial firms around the world, Ascent provides Knowledge-as-a-Service (KaaS) as a groundbreaking new way to navigate the increasingly complex world of regulations quickly, efficiently, and most important of all, reliably.

"FinTech Plaid Teams With Payments Hub Jack Henry
FinTech startup Plaid is partnering with payments hub Jack Henry & Associates to advance the Plaid Exchange for more than 350 financial institutions (FIs).
â€œWe developed Plaid Exchange to make open finance as simple as possible for financial institutions â€” no matter their size,â€ Niko Karvounis, Plaid head of product, institutions said in a statement on Tuesday (Nov. 24).
â€œOur partnership with Jack Henry helps us bring Plaid Exchange to hundreds of regional and community banks, and helps ensure millions of people can access digital finance apps and services no matter where they choose to bank, invest and manage their money,â€ Karvounis added.
Since launching Plaid Exchange in May, Plaid said they have discovered that many FIs need technical support in order to integrate the platform. The tie-up gives Jack Henry customers access to the Plaid network and provides extra security to the 350-plus financial institutions using Jack Henryâ€™s Banno digital platform.
Plaid Exchange is the industryâ€™s first open finance platform, the company said. It gives banks, wealth managers, and FinTechs a way to offer stable solutions to connect accounts to apps and services.
â€œAt Plaid, we believe itâ€™s important to make sure everyone has the same ability to benefit from fintech, no matter where they bank,â€ said Reed Bouchelle, head of strategic partnerships at Plaid. â€œBoth Plaid and Jack Henry care deeply about building superior technological solutions for financial institutions.â€
Earlier this year, Plaid introduced the Plaid Exchange Partner Program, in collaboration with the API management platform MuleSoft.

Starling Bank and Funding Circle team up to provide Â£300m in CBILS loans
Starling Bank and the UKâ€™s largest alternative lender Funding Circle have teamed up to provide small businesses with Â£300 million in loans under the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS).
Starling will provide lending services through Funding Circleâ€™s platform in a bid to help more than 4,000 small businesses, a figure the fintechs have calculated based on the average loan size of Â£70,000.
Both start-ups were accredited by the British Business Bank last month, with Starling Bank also later getting accredited for the Bounce Back Loan Scheme (BBLS) which launched last week.
The strategic partnership is designed to help boost cash flow for businesses during the UKâ€™s coronavirus lockdown.
â€œThis partnership with Funding Circle provides us with another outlet, on top of our own CBILS and BBLS lending, to help meet the needs of business owners affected by coronavirus,â€ says Starling Bankâ€™s CEO Anne Boden in a statement.
â€œItâ€™s a great example of the fintech industry pulling together to meet a very urgent need.â€
On 11 May, the UKâ€™s prime minister Boris Johnson, unveiled the governmentâ€™s 51-page exit plan for a phased lifting of lockdown measures.

The planâ€™s third phase, set to start â€œno earlier than 4 Julyâ€, would see the reopening of â€œat least some of the remaining businesses and premises that have been forced to closeâ€, such as hairdressers, some hospitality venues such as pubs and restaurants, and various public spaces such as leisure centres.
The prolonged lockdown for these businesses will mean sustaining cashflow is vital, making Starling Bank and Funding Circleâ€™s partnership timely.
The fintechs point out that since 2017, the majority of net growth in small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) finance has come from fintech lenders, citing March 2020 Bank of England data.
â€œSmall businesses form the backbone of the UK economy and will be at the heart of the nationâ€™s future recovery,â€ says Funding Circleâ€™s UK MD, Lisa Jacobs.
â€œWe are pleased to be able to offer businesses a decision in as little as four minutes through our instant decision technology.â€
These fintechs were joined this week by a new round of accredited lenders. MarketFinance, Capital on Tap, Bank Leumi and Shawbrook Bank have all joined what is now more than 60 CBILS accredited lenders, and the Bank of Ireland UK and Skipton Business Finance can offer loans under the BBL scheme.

Starling Bank will be working alongside Funding Options in order to deliver access to finance for small- to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) in the U.K., according to a UKTN report.
Starling Bank is the newest member of the Funding Options lending panel, which has more than 120 members. Starling has 5 percent of the U.K. SMB market, the report stated.
There were 5.98 million private businesses that participated in the economy throughout 2020 and the pandemic. SMBs, the report stated, accounted for around 52 percent of turnover and 60 percent of jobs, which came out to 16.6 million jobs.
Starling Bank has issued 2 billion pounds (about $2.7 billion) in government-backed loans amid the pandemic. Two-thirds of the recipients were outside of London, and the company has plans to grow its SMB base more than four-fold, which would give it an 18 percent hold on the U.K. market over the coming five years, according to the report.
Funding Options was no slouch during the pandemic itself, processing over 850 million pounds (about $1.2 billion) in Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS) loans. The company used its proprietary technology to match companies that had suitable lending options quickly.

"Stripe expands partnership with Wix to provide powerful omnichannel solutions for businesses
SAN FRANCISCOâ€”Stripe and Wix, a leading global SaaS platform to create, manage, and grow an online presence, today announced an expanded partnership to power in-person payments for its users. With more than 200 million users globally, Wix enables businesses, organizations, artists, and individuals to build and evolve their brands and businesses online.
As economies around the world reopen after the COVID-19 pandemic, consumer expectations have shifted towards more flexible commerce. Many businesses that pivoted online during the crisisâ€”including more than 31 million new users who joined Wixâ€™s platform in 2020â€”are now grappling with hybrid operations as they look for ways to bring their services back to the offline world.
Stripeâ€™s integrated product suite ensures platforms can provide a seamless experience for businesses and their customers. By layering Terminal, Stripeâ€™s programmable point of sale, atop their existing integration with Stripe Connect, Wix can provide its users with everything they need to run and scale an omnichannel business. That includes website creation and management, logistics and operations, and payment processing for both online and in-person transactions, all with a 360Â° understanding of their business activity.

Week over week weâ€™re probably growing 30% and weâ€™re excited about our future.â€
Stripe and Wix have been partners since 2014, processing billions of dollars on behalf of business owners on the Wix platform. Itâ€™s not only Stripeâ€™s APIs and integrated platform that made Wix select Stripe Terminal, but also this long history of building success together. As Wix continues to offer more revenue management options to merchants, Stripeâ€™s growing Global Payments and Treasury Network (GPTN) will serve as the foundational layer for Wix to expand its offerings to more geographies while doubling down on focus areas like product development and customer service.

"Nexsys Technologies Partners With Lemonade To Simplify Insurance Verification
Nexsys Technologies, a Fintech company that provides a suite of tech solutions for mortgage origination and closing, has partnered with insurance company Lemonade to simplify the homeowners insurance verification process. Using Clear HOI, Nexsys users will be able to leverage a tool which digitizes the previously manual communication between mortgage lenders and homeowners insurance companies.
In the past, verifying that homeowners insurance was in force for new mortgage transactions was an inefficient undertaking, with lenders contacting insurance carriers by phone to manually confirm. Clear HOI has modernized that process by creating a digital connection between insurers and mortgage lenders â€“ removing unnecessary delays and eliminating potential errors. Now that Lemonade has joined the Clear HOI platform, mortgage lenders will be able to use the innovative tool with even more clients.
Nexsys Technologies has also developed a new set of application programming interfaces allowing mortgage lenders to securely pull in evidence of insurance directly into their loan origination systems â€“ ensuring that a clientâ€™s privacy is protected. Using these interfaces, the company will work with Lemonadeâ€™s AI-powered insurance platform to provide an easy integration between Lemonade and a mortgage lenderâ€™s origination system. This integration will allow Lemonade to quickly confirm a client has provided consent to share their insurance information, which in turn will maximize efficiency.
In addition to Clear HOI, Nexsys offers Clear Sign, an electronic closing (eClosing) platform that improves the speed and efficiency of mortgage closings. Clear Sign has been used to eClose more than 30,000 mortgage transactions since its launch in April 2019.",4

The real problem behind the Oranj business model
Advisers certainly enjoyed free access to products on the platform, but price alone might not have been enough to keep them satisfied
David Lyon is founder and CEO of Oranj, which is slated to close at the end of the year. 
Advisers certainly enjoyed free access to products on the platform, but price alone might not have been enough to keep them satisfied
From the outside, the Oranj business model appeared to address the surge of advisers looking to gain an edge with the latest model portfolios that offer access to inexpensive and effective outsourced investment models.Â 
The free technology allowed the advisers to create investment strategies with funds from Oranjâ€™s partner asset managers. The success of model marketplaces in recent years opened the company up to partner with at least 27 funds and launch partnerships with providers like Allianz Global Investors and Liberty One Investment Management in recent months, according to company announcements.
Yet, advisers on the platform said they were beginning to feel the pinch of limited access to funds through the free model marketplace.
â€œ[Oranj] clearly had a relationship with certain mutual fund companies and those were the only funds you could use,â€ said financial planner John Bovard, owner of Cincinnati, Ohio-based Incline Wealth Advisors. The firm had been using Oranjâ€™s platform for about six months before the fintech announced last month that it was closing its doors for good.
Oranj entered into partnerships to provide model marketplaces to advisers for free, essentially becoming a distribution arm to large fund families like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton. Ultimately, that relationship gave the fund providers some form of control over what would and would not be offered on the platform, according to some industry observers â€” a limitation that didnâ€™t sit well with advisers interviewed by InvestmentNews.
For example, Oranj had a partnership with asset manager Invesco, yet there were still a selection of the companyâ€™s ETFs that advisers couldnâ€™t access, according to Bovard. â€œIt was definitely frustrating,â€ he said. â€œ[Oranj] sounded good in theory and I think what helped them was having those mutual fund companies that had their wholesalers suggesting [Oranj] to advisers. But the lack of fund availability really restricted it.â€Â 
For Bovard, who signed up for Oranj through Invesco, the real draw was the free technology because he could potentially save hundreds of dollars a month, he said. Instead, his firm has transitioned to its custodian, Charles Schwab, for portfolio rebalancing and trades, but will be using its own model portfolios.
The ultimate problems with Oranj go deeper than just the limited selection of investments, according to financial planning expert Michael Kitces. The core issue was that the company couldnâ€™t bring to the table a technology offering that advisers werenâ€™t able to get elsewhere, he said.Â 
â€œIn practice Iâ€™m sure the breadth of investment options, or lack thereof, was a constraint for Oranj, but more investment options wasnâ€™t going to be the path to success for them,â€ Kitces said in an email. â€œDifferentiation that overcomes switching costs was the key issue they donâ€™t appear to have ever fully solved for.â€
Oranj is offering up Morningstar as a substitute for clients looking to transition, according to an email sent to Oranj users and reviewed by InvestmentNews. â€œAs you plan for your transition from Oranj, our friends at Morningstar are offering 6 months for free on Morningstar Office,â€ according to the email.
In addition to Morningstar, a handful of other fintechs, like Orion Advisor Solutions and Riskalyze, are offering discounted products to entice former Oranj users.
There also seemed to be general transparency issues with the business model â€” particularly surrounding the fact that certain asset managers were paying for distribution â€” despite the firmâ€™s attempts to be very clear about how the platform worked, according to Jason Wenk, CEO and Founder of digital brokerage Altruist.Â 
â€œIt was murky,â€ Wenk said. â€œRIAs hold themselves as fiduciaries and champions of transparency, and the [business model] wasnâ€™t the worldâ€™s most transparent arrangement.â€
The model just didnâ€™t end up attracting the mass influx of users the company had expected, he added.Â â€œOne could argue what [Oranj] did is not much different than Robinhood, but Robinhood had the scale,â€ Wenk said. â€œThose radical pricing models only work if you reach scale.â€
Without a large enough client base, Oranj faced challenges expanding its offerings at a regular cadence, according to Chief Business Development Officer John Mackowiak at Advyzon.
â€œSeemed like [Oranj] never really settled on where they wanted to land from a capability perspective,â€ Mackowiak said. â€œAnyone can open a model marketplace, so how was [Oranj] going to differentiate? In my opinion, the client base comes first so when you open a model marketplace, itâ€™s attractive to all of the asset managers.â€",0

The deal, which was announced earlier this year, is seen as a significant step forward in the mission to provide easier and faster cross-border transfers. However, while the total monetary value of Rippleâ€™s commitment to MoneyGram was valued at $50 million, Ripple could only pay up a 60 percent down payment at the time.
Ripple now owns Moneygram. Bitcoin fundamentals are stronger than ever, but price is below 2017 â€“ by a lot. Institutional players coming online. Regulators shaping licensing. Bitcoin halving next year. If you think 2017 was the bubble I have big, big news for you.

Expansion and Better On-Demand Settlements
According to a recent release from MoneyGram, the San Francisco-based company has now ponied up the remaining $20 million, thus effectively completing the investment.
With the $50 million, Ripple now owns 9.95 percent of MoneyGramâ€™s common stock, purchased at $4.10 a share. According to the terms of the deal signed in June, both companies will work together for the next two years. The partnership will focus on using digital assets to make cross-border payments and foreign exchange settlements. MoneyGram will use Rippleâ€™s xRapid liquidity product to achieve fast and seamless inter-currency settlements. This would be achieved by using the XRP token, which enables xRapid to provide faster transaction settlement than with fiat currencies or any other digital asset.
On the new investment, Brad Garlinghouse, the chief executive of Ripple Labs, spoke on the success of their partnership so far, as MoneyGram has been able to bring On-Demand liquidity to the Philippines.
â€œWeâ€™re excited to support MoneyGramâ€™s further expansion into Europe and Australia. Digital assets and blockchain technology have the potential to make a tremendous impact on cross-border payments â€” MoneyGram and Ripple is an example of that. In June, we announced this partnership, and itâ€™s encouraging to see the rapid growth and benefits come to life,â€ he explained.
Rippleâ€™s Remarkable 2019
The purchase should cap off a year where Ripple made some strategic expansions. On August 15, xSpring- another Ripple subsidiary- gave a 1 billion XRP (worth about $250 million at the time) grant to Coil, a platform that helps content creators to monetize their work.
The funds will help Coil to develop an ecosystem of companies, creators, and developers that will use XRP as a base currency to monetize their content. Some of the invested sums will also go to helping to spread the word about Coil across content developers and other members of its intended audience.
In September, Ripple took a step to increase its adoption among exchanges by acquiring crypto trading firm Algrim. The company is expected to add six engineers to the core Ripple dev team, with a focus on providing seamless XRP integration with partner crypto exchanges. They will also help to bolster Rippleâ€™s cross-border payment corridors and develop the xRapid product.",3

"Tradeshift and Raindew Trade launch a US$1.5 billion initiative to revive supply chains in Africa
Tradeshift, a leader in supply chain payments and marketplaces launched a ZAR25 billion (""USD1.5 billion"") COVID-19 Instant Supplier payment scheme for businesses in South Africa and selected African markets in partnership with Raindew Trade, a trade and supply chain financing platform providing supply chain solutions to corporations in Africa and other selected markets.
San Francisco, Aug. 10, 2020 -- Tradeshift, a leader in supply chain payments and marketplaces launched a ZAR25 billion (""USD1.5 billion"") COVID-19 Instant Supplier payment scheme for businesses in South Africa and selected African markets in partnership with Raindew Trade, a trade and supply chain financing platform providing supply chain solutions to corporations in Africa and other selected markets.
Launched off the back of the recent roll-out of Tradeshift Engage and a similar USD55 billion Instant Supplier Payment program with Denmark's Export Credit Agency, the initiative addresses the cash flow and liquidity challenges in African supply chains.
Underlined by the current COVID-19 economic environment, weakness in African supply chains contribute to the realisation that digital supply chain management and payment infrastructure is no longer an investment in the future.
Utilizing the Tradeshift platform, the Instant Supplier Payment scheme will inject liquidity into the market and accelerate digitisation in supply chains at scale and with speed building a true digital collaboration between suppliers, buyers, and financing institutions.
Providing economic relief to corporate buyers and suppliers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and unclogging cash flow impact, the Instant Supplier Payment directly addresses the concerns in the African supply chain.
Through upfront and early payments to suppliers, corporate buyers can request payments in advance to pre-qualified suppliers to be made on their behalf, with credit payment terms of 21 to 360 days
Additionally, the Instant Supplier Payment enables to export and import financing solutions for cross-border trades, allowing exporters to get paid upfront or on the same day of their export shipment.
Commenting on the topic, Dan Quinn, General Manager - Middle East & Africa Region at Tradeshift, added, ""Today, industries of scale across the region must start with the path to recovery, but they also need to look beyond just recovery, which means re-thinking the foundation and infrastructure their core operations are built on.""
""Now is the time for businesses to commit to closing their digital gaps. The smart starting point today is digitising core infrastructure, supply chain management, and invoicing and payment systems. These are essential to help get cash flowing again in the short-term, protect business continuity in the face of an uncertain future, and building a strong, core foundation for a prosperous, sustainable future.""
Allan Musona, Executive Director and co-founder of Raindew Trade added, ""Covid-19 forced all of us to develop a deeper and more concrete understanding of digital infrastructure. We have mobilized the full spectrum of our digital infrastructure to contribute to the global fight against Covid-19, to enable sustainable recovery of supply chains and provide support for SMEs who are essential for global trade.""
This initiative provides an immediate solution for infrastructure issues and sets the foundation for post-COVID economic recovery, injecting liquidity in corporate supply chains and digitising procure to pay and supply chain processes in South Africa and select African markets.

"Apple partners with Cloudflare to improve internet privacy
A new proposed DNS standard called ""Oblivious DoH"" â€” co-authored by engineers from Cloudflare, Apple, and Fastly â€” separates IP addressesâ€¦ The post Apple partners with Cloudflare to improve internet privacy appeared first on MacDailyNews.
On Tuesday, Cloudflare announced support for a new proposed DNS standard called â€œOblivious DoHâ€ â€” co-authored by engineers from Cloudflare, Apple, and Fastly â€” that separates IP addresses from queries, so that no single entity can see both at the same time. Theyâ€™ve also made the source code available, so anyone can try out ODoH, or run their own ODoH service.
Tanya Verma and Sudheesh Singanamalla for The Cloudflare Blog:
The whole process begins with clients that encrypt their query for the target using HPKE. Clients obtain the targetâ€™s public key via DNS, where it is bundled into a HTTPS resource record and protected by DNSSEC. When the TTL for this key expires, clients request a new copy of the key as needed (just as they would for an A/AAAA record when that recordâ€™s TTL expires). The usage of a targetâ€™s DNSSEC-validated public key guarantees that only the intended target can decrypt the query and encrypt a response (answer).
Clients transmit these encrypted queries to a proxy over an HTTPS connection. Upon receipt, the proxy forwards the query to the designated target. The target then decrypts the query, produces a response by sending the query to a recursive resolver such as 1.1.1.1, and then encrypts the response to the client. The encrypted query from the client contains encapsulated keying material from which targets derive the response encryption symmetric key.
This response is then sent back to the proxy, and then subsequently forwarded to the client. All communication is authenticated and confidential since these DNS messages are end-to-end encrypted, despite being transmitted over two separate HTTPS connections (client-proxy and proxy-target). The message that otherwise appears to the proxy as plaintext is actually an encrypted garble.

Modul8 and Nium partner to provide card-issuing for APAC region
In the last month, challenger banking services and incumbents alike have been racing to unveil their open banking services to Australiaâ€™s 25 million citizens.
â€œAs someone who has been in the banking and financial services industry for decades, Iâ€™m really proud to play a part in the revolution that will be enabled by open banking,â€ says Modul8â€™s CEO, David Laird.
A three-month â€œDIY approachâ€
New partners Modul8 and Nium say they will focus on delivering card-issuing services for fintechs, rather than incumbent players.
The two claim they can deliver the service for companies in as little as three months, which they claim is â€œa quarter of the usual year-long timelineâ€.
The onboarding process during this three-month period takes â€œa DIY approachâ€, which the firms say will save money for start-up clients.
â€œAt a time of global uncertainty, our economy needs transformative digital businesses that can provide the framework for a post-COVID recovery,â€ says Laird.
Modul8â€™s CEO comes from six years at Australian incumbent Commonwealth Bank, where he directed transaction banking solutions.
He also spent more than nine years at fellow incumbent ANZ. Here, he helped developed the bankâ€™s ecommerce and transaction banking capabilities.
A strong partner in Nium
Nium has evolved from solely focusing on consumer remittance under its former name InstaRem, to providing fintech solutions for businesses.
It facilitates cross-border payments between 90 countries, and real-time cross-border payments across 65 corridors.
Its Visa-led funding round in May was likely worth between $75-$100 million, according toÂ DealStreetAsia.
Nium is Visaâ€™s third investment in Southeast Asia, alongside ride-hailing apps Gojek and Grab.
Itâ€™s also one of Southeast Asiaâ€™s most well-funded fintechs. It last closed a $41 million Series C round in March 2019, led by Temasek-backed Vertex Growth Fund.
And in Q1 of this year, it saw $2 billion worth of transactions flow through its platform.
